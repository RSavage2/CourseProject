During each mission the player must battle enemy jets, choppers, submarines, jeeps, parachute bombs and several other different enemies.

The game includes three difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard. The player cannot complete the game if they play on the easy setting.  </div>  <div> Plot : Years ago, an evil militaristic organization called N.A.C developed a huge laser emitter, called ""EL"". It was capable of gradually destroying the Earth's ozone layer. This, of course, posed a great threat to all life on the planet and cast a shadow of fear that went to the far corners of the Earth. In the year 1999, (where was I when this happened?) the N.A.C began an all-out fight against all the countries in the world. At first, each nations Self-Defense forces valiantly stood their ground against the most formidable adversaries, eventually they proved to be no match of the sheer power and size of the enemy. However, just as all seemed lost, the ""Freedom Fighters"" appeared. They weren't officially attached to any one nation, so they secretly deployed to clash with the unsuspecting enemy forces.  </div>  <div> Release Dates : Aerial Assault was originally released for the Sega Master System in 1990.

AlienÂ³,Probe Entertainment Ltd.,ArenaAcclaim JP,1993,gg,An action game from Acclaim based on the 1992 David Fincher movie. The player assumes the role of Ripley as she explores the prison planet of Fury 161.,3030-14356,14356,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/alien3/3030-14356/,," <div> Overview : With the release of the Alien 3 film several games were released to tie into the film. With the Super Nintendo and Genesis as the leading platforms the game was built and ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64 and Game Gear. The games are set on the world of the film, Fury 161, but the gameplay actually has more in common with the film Aliens, throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player. Whereas in Alien 3 there was only one xenomorph.The video game versions (except the Nintendo Entertainment System) were praised at the time of its release for not sticking with the lack of guns and multiple aliens in the film, which was the film's most criticized aspects. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The SNES version had varied missions to complete.In the SNES version, Ripley begins the game in a corridor where she can operate a computer terminal which gives her access to various missions. Missions have Ripley completing objectives such as destroying groups of eggs, fixing pipes or junction boxes, isolating rooms, killing Alien Queens or rescuing trapped inmates. Completing these missions leads to the game's ending, which is closer to the movie than the other versions. Like most versions of the game, the SNES version was liberal with the material, generating waves of enemies to combat.Unlike the other versions of the game, health, ammo and enemies respawn during the levels.There are 6 levels in total, each having a range of missions in them. Since completing a level takes around half an hour to an hour, the levels can be accessed via a password system.The soundtrack is inspired on that of the film's, unlike the Genesis's more action game music. Complex orchestrations delivered by the SNES's sound chip accompany the game to give it a movie-like feeling.The graphics are also superior, having rich detail in the backgrounds and effects like smoke and rain occurring in parts of Fury 161. Ripley and her enemies have smooth animations and there are lighting effects on the scenery and/or the objects when using a flame thrower in egg rooms or closing a door.The SNES version was released after the movie, therefore it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or scenery present at the time of the other versions' developments. </div>  <div> Genesis Version : The Genesis version was a slightly different case. Instead of missions in a large, persistent area, the game uses stages (or levels) like many other platformers of the time. The majority of these see the player fighting their way through hordes of Aliens in order to rescue prisoners before the timer runs out. When the timer does run out, the player is show a scene of each of the remaining prisoners giving birth to a chestburster Alien. In addition to these rescue missions, there are other mission instances. Every few missions the player must fight a boss alien (and in the games finale, two at once) and occasionally, the player will have to rescue lots of prisoners, without interference from Aliens. As well as the opposite, having to shoot lots of Aliens and reach the exit without needing to rescue prisoners.Rescue the prisoners as fast as possible, before this happens.The game consists of roughly 20 missions, each increasing in difficulty and features several different locations from the movie (such as the prison grounds, the lead works, the slaughter house, the Alien nest, etc) and features a number of weapons commonly seen in the franchise (but ironically, none of which were seen in the actual film) the pulse rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher and hand grenades.In addition to this, the player is given health and battery pickups. The battery pickups allow the motion tracker in the top right hand corner of the screen to work for a short time, but once the battery has run out it reverts to being blank again until the player picks up another battery. Enemies include the ubiquitous Alien, as well as much later in the game Eggs and Facehuggers, in addition to the larger boss Aliens.Since the movie was subject to various creative inputs due to a lack of consent over the final script, many things were scrapped but some remained in the video game, such as the abattoir level (which is present in the recent Alien 3 Assembly Cut) and the fact that Ripley survives in the end. </div>  <div> Master System, Game Gear, Amiga and Commodore 64 Versions : The Master System and Game Gear versions are very similar to the Genesis version, the first few levels are exactly the same but with a major graphical downgrade. The player has access to largely the same arsenal of movements and weapons, as well as having a countdown clock and prisoners to rescue. Beyond the first few levels, they begin to differ slightly, but not much from the Genesis version of the game.The Commodore 64 version follows the same principle and scenery of the Genesis game, but with altered level design.The Amiga version looked and played similar to the Genesis version in terms of graphics but the player had to choose either to play the music or sound effects but not both. </div>  <div> NES Version : The NES version was developed by LJN LTD, and featured a drastically different visual style as well as gameplay mechanics. The graphics are indistinct, the Alien creatures appear to be vague shapes of solid color and the game world itself features a lot less detail than that of the Master System, or other versions. The game features a large HUD which occupies the bottom portion of the screen and displays information such as remaining ammunition. The game's sound effects were also a much lower quality than that of other versions. The game featured a variety of different mission locations taken from the film, and like the other versions the main objective throughout the game is to rescue prisoners on each level before proceeding to the exit.Though seen as a mediocre game at the time of its release, the game has been heavily criticized as time went by. </div> "

Once an athlete has been selected, two main buttons will be used during the match. The (A) button will help the player lob the ball in the air while the (B) button will help them hit the ball normally (this is for the Genesis version). When the ball is served or hit on the player's side of the court, they must get as close as possible to the ball and hit it back. The player can use either a backhand or forehand depending on their position before hitting the ball. They can move around the court and position themselves using the D-pad. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Practice Mode - This mode allows the player to select an athlete and have a ball machine feed them balls so the player can practice their game. There are no winner or losers in this mode.Tournament Mode - Like a career mode, the player selects an athlete to play as in a tournament and face many opponents before facing the final match and winning it all.Skins Tournament Mode - This is a tournament that places money down on each hit that takes place during the match. Whoever wins a point will receive the total amount of money in the pot. The pot starts with $10 and doubles each hit from there on in. </div> "

One of the major selling points of the game is the ability to punch opponents as a means of stealing the ball from them (with the taglines ""It's a BasketBRAWL!"" and ""No harm, no foul!""). Its game style was later improved upon with the 1993 spiritual successor, NBA Jam.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1990, and to both the Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear in 1992. The NES version was ported by Rare and published by Acclaim, while the other two versions were ported by Arc Developments and published by Acclaim's Flying Edge brand.Similar to other Midway arcade games at the time, Arch Rivals was included in numerous compilations throughout the 2000's, including Midway Arcade Treasures 2 (for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube), Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play (for PlayStation Portable), Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition (for PC), Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures (for PlayStation 2), Midway Arcade (for iOS devices), and Midway Arcade Origins (for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Along with moving around the screen with the joystick, players have access to two buttons: Pass (White) and Shoot (Red). These buttons perform different actions depending on ball possession:If the player has the ball, pressing the Pass button causes them to pass the ball to their teammate, while pressing the Shoot button causes them to attempt a jump shot (or a dunk if close to the basket). The Pass button can be held down, leaving them unable to move (due to the ""double dribble"" rule), and pressing Shoot while in this state instead performs a ""Fake-Out"" jump shot.If the player's teammate has the ball, pressing either button causes them to call out plays (""Pass It!"", ""Over Here"", and ""I'm Open"" for passing and ""Shoot It!"" ""Put It Up!"", and ""Let's Go!"" for shooting), forcing their teammate to either pass or shoot.Otherwise, pressing the Pass button causes the player to throw a punch in an attempt to knockdown their opponents (causing them to drop the ball if they possess it), while pressing the Shoot button causes them to perform a jumping block (both for attempting to block an opponent's shot and for getting a rebound from a jump shot). The Pass button can be held down, and pressing Shoot while in this state causes the player to perform a leaping lunge (which steals the ball from the opponent if done right, but causes them to tumble to the floor otherwise). </div>  <div> Teams & Players : The game includes four fictional teams by default: Chicago (red/white), Los Angeles (blue/gold), Natural High (green/white), and Brawl State (purple/gold). Each match starts with a random combination of teams, and can re-shuffle the teams as long as they'd like.In the Arcade version, arcade operators can use the ""Hometown Heroes"" feature to change both the names and colors of each team. Other color combinations include blue/red, black/red, black/orange, black/gold, black/gray, black/white, purple/white, green/gold, purple/gold, and red/gold.In the NES version, the Away jerseys for all teams is white. In the Genesis and Game Gear versions, the colors of all teams are randomized (red/white, blue/white, green/white, gold/white, and purple/white), with no separate Home jersey.In all versions but the GG port, each player chooses one of eight fictional basketball players to represent them:Blade - A Crowd PleaserHammer - Rebound KingLewis - Top ShooterMohawk - Tough & MeanMoose - Real ChampReggie - All-AmericanTyrone - Defensive GiantVinnie - A Great PlayerWhile each player has their own description, it is unknown whether it affects their actual stats.

The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems. </div>  <div> Story : A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the ""Madman"" himself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive. </div>  <div> Ports : Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay. </div> "

One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills). </div>  <div> Story : The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, ""What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained..."".Danyon Carpenter wrote, ""...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation..."". </div> "

Players battle the mad doctor and twelve of his underlings in order to save the denizens of Beanville.,3030-11442,11442,0,1993-12-04,https://www.giantbomb.com/dr-robotniks-mean-bean-machine/3030-11442/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (Dr. Eggman no Mean Bean Machine in the Japanese version of Sonic Mega Collection) is a competitive puzzle game developed by Compile and published by Sega primarily for the Sega Genesis, with ports made for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. The game is also included in several compilations, such as Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The Genesis version was not released in Japan until 2000, where a PC port of the title was included in ""Sega Archives from USA vol. 2""; the Game Gear version was first available to Japanese audiences in Sonic Adventure DX.Mean Bean Machine is, in essence, a reskinned version of the original Puyo Puyo. Though a more direct English translation of Puyo Puyo's Game Gear port titled ""Puzlow Kids"" was developed, the decision was ultimately made to change the game's aesthetics; allegedly, this was due to the belief that Westerners wouldn't accept a game featuring a little girl as the protagonist. The characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari series were replaced with characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, a cartoon series based on the Sonic franchise.More than a year later, Puyo Puyo's Super Famicom port was reskinned with a Kirby theme and released as Kirby's Avalanche. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Colored beans fall from the top of the screen and must be cleared by connecting four or more beans of the same color. By doing so, the player generates Refugee beans that are sent to the opponent. Refugee beans, once they fall onto the opponent's field, cannot be matched with any other beans; instead, they are removed by clearing an adjacent set of colored beans. The first player that cannot bring more beans into their field loses.In the game's Scenario mode, the player competes in one-on-one duels with Dr. Robotnik's robot underlings in order to save the bean creatures from being turned into robots. They are faced in the following order:ArmsFranklyHumptyCoconutsDavy SprocketSkweelDynamightGrounderSpikeSir F-Fuzzy LogikDragon BreathScratchDr. RobotnikExercise Mode lets players to match beans until they lose, while Vs. Mode allows two players to go head-to-head. The Game Gear version includes Puzzle Mode, which presents the player with several challenges. </div>  <div> Changes from Puyo Puyo : Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine's gameplay is nearly identical to Puyo Puyo, right down to the AI behavior of each opponent. However, Mean Bean Machine removes the Beginner course that was present in Puyo Puyo. A new password feature is included that allows players to continue their progress.Mean Bean Machine uses several audio and visual assets from Puyo Puyo. Carbuncle remains in the game; he is renamed ""Has Bean"" and given an all-new backstory. The battleground is taken from the backdrop of Puyo Puyo's early matches. Several of Mean Bean Machine's music tracks, including the Exercise, Vs, Password, and Ending themes, were either directly taken from Puyo Puyo or remixed from songs featured in the game. </div> "

Earthworm Jim,Eurocom,Playmates NAVirgin Games EU,July 1995,gg,"Created by the twisted minds at Shiny Entertainment (led by Dave Perry and Doug TenNapel), Earthworm Jim is a nonsensical side-scrolling platform game that allows the player to venture through the galaxy as an earthworm trapped in a futuristic space-suit to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name.",3030-11133,11133,0,1994-10-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/earthworm-jim/3030-11133/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Earthworm Jim is a side-scroller shooter from Shiny Entertainment and the first game in their Earthworm Jim series. The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles. </div>  <div> Story : Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, ""New Junk City"". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blasterJim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping. </div>  <div> Planets : Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck. </div>  <div> Avatar Awards : Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue. </div> "

Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.In Eccoâs future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with âskywaysâ or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astriteâs last two globes and went back to the present.The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time. </div> "

In arcades, the game was released in three cabinet variants; a standard standup version, a sit-down version and the custom sitdown R-360 cabinet. The R-360 was able to rotate freely on two axes, allowing the cabinet to mimic in-game action, including turning the cabinet completely upside down. Due to the impressiveness of the R-360 cabinet the home computer versions (Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Amiga) were named G-LOC R360.Some ports of the game included features not present in the arcade version. For instance the Mega Drive / Genesis version alternates between first and third-person perspectives, the Master System port features bosses and the Game Gear port allows the player to spend points earned while playing to upgrade the jet. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player controls an experimental aircraft in timed missions - the player earns more time and advances stages by achieving goals that are set in each stage. During the course of the game the player is attacked from both the front and the back by enemy aircraft. The player controls the aircraft with a joystick and has two weapons: a cannon and missiles. The player can either try to gun down enemy planes or attempt to gain missile lock by moving the crosshair over them. The game is played mostly from a first person perspective, however once locked on to by an enemy the perspective changes to third person (behind the player's aircraft) to allow for evasive manoeuvers. </div>  <div> Trivia : Michael Jackson owned an R-360 deluxe cabinet of this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.  </div> "

Mainly, Dennis Nedry's Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos, which serves as the opening plot point for the main characters to meet. The timeline of the game occurs both within the film and in the aftermath of the incident, and the player experiences these moments in part from the viewpoint of Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian, Gerry Harding. Other characters include Harding's daughter Jess and other inhabitants of Isla Nublar not seen in the movie, such as scientists, smugglers, or mercenaries. Like recent releases from Telltale Games, Jurassic Park: The Game is broken up into a series of four episodes. However, all four episodes ship with the game, with one easily transitioning to the next without having to purchase the next episode piecemeal. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Telltale Games has said to have been heavily influenced by Heavy Rain's mechanics. The game includes slow-paced investigation sequences where the player pans the camera and initiates sequences where the main character takes closer looks at key places. This is often accompanied with dialogue choices, moving between key locations within the puzzle area, and minor button-mashing sequences. It will also shift to immediate response Quick Time Events when a life or death situation presents itself, such as directional input either solo or in sequences, and also faster button-mashing sequences.

Hired by BioSyn, she's been searching for Dennis Nedry and the can, unaware of the content or even about the kind of animals roaming the park. After surviving an onslaught of Dilophosauruses, she's then been attacked by a different kind of poisonous dinosaur called Troodon and there's a pack of them stalking her as she grows weaker with every step. This is where she's almost run over by a jeep driven by Gerry Harding, on his way back to the visitor's center with his teenage daughter Jess. Unaware of her reasons to be on the island, Gerry lifts her into the car and tries to stabilize her so she can receive treatment. When they make it back to the visitor's center, they enter it just in time to miss the sight of the helicopter carrying off the survivors from the motion picture.With the T-rex still being around, they fight their way to save Nima and survive themselves. Though the situation naturally only gets worse as Nima's desperation to get the can to the North Harbor becomes more apparent. Only minutes after regaining consciousness, she draws a gun on the father and daughter. </div> "

The first, released only in Japan, was ported by Namco who also published the game. The second was the standard Tengen version available on other platforms. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch up to five blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Blocks are dropped in order of recency, with the newest block dropped first. Similarly, the player may launch blocks back up the conveyor belt in an attempt to ""juggle"" them to get the appropriate color ready. </div>  <div> Blob Ball : A Klax is the simplest pattern of three matching blocks. Each pattern is a multiplier based on the number of Klaxes it is worth. Four matching tiles in a row, as an example, are worth two Klaxes. Points are scored based on pattern size. The more blocks which are simultaneously removed, the higher the score. Empty space at the end of the round is also scored. After each round, the player may skip 5 or 10 stages, which results in a higher score multiplier, and more available drops. Difficulty is similarly ramped up faster. Stages have unique challenges, such as forming a specific pattern a number of times (""complete 5 diagonals""). </div> "

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first ""killer apps"" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked ""GOAL""). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no ""lives remaining"" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black ""enemy"" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time. </div> "

A few notable differences from other Mega Man games include the fact that there is one Robot Master who does not have a weakness (Wave Man, whose weakness is Charge Man's Charge Kick, which does not appear in this game). Additionally, the small screen size of the Game Gear increases the game's difficulty and also causes an increase in vertical scrolling; an effect that was noted by some critics.The plot of Mega Man is borrowed from Mega Man 4, although the player never fights Dr. Cossack. Rather, the player goes through Wave Man and Toad Man's stages respectively, also fighting the two bosses.

Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use). Players start with one-third (one bar) of the meter full, and can fill up the meter by performing special moves, getting hit by an opponent's attack, or getting their attack blocked. In the first round, the first person to successfully land an attack earns another bar of their meter instantly.Enhanced Special Moves (uses one bar) - An enhanced version of a special move that can inflict more damage, add additional attacks, or changes the properties of the move (such as adding armor properties), which is executed by combining the activation of the special move with the Block button.Breakers (uses two bars) - A simple combo breaker that is executed during an opponent's combo by holding Forward and Block as the opponent connects another attack. It immediately knocks down the opponent (though dealing no damage), escaping further combo damage while giving positional advantage.X-Ray Attacks (uses all thee bars) - Executed by pressing either the Flip Stance and Block buttons or the Front Kick, Back Kick, and Block Buttons simultaneously, the character performs a starting attack. If it connects successfully, the character goes into an animated sequence of powerful attacks (that shows close-up X-Ray animations of the damage being dealt internally). Each character has a unique X-Ray Attack, sometimes using special properties (for example, Johnny Cage's X-Ray Attack starts with a counter move, while Stryker's X-Ray Attack starts with armor properties). </div>  <div> Characters : Mortal Kombat introduces tag team combat (in a similar vein to the Marvel vs. Capcom series) to the franchise as an optional feature, pitting two fighters against two other fighters. Unlike 2-vs-2 modes in previous Mortal Kombat games (in with the second fighter can only fight when the first fighter is defeated), fighters can be swapped out on-the-fly, as well as jump in for a quick tag-team attack. When one fighter is defeated, the other fighter on the team immediately jumps in (without the ability to swap out or perform tag-team attacks). Each round ends when both fighters in a team are defeated. In some occasions, matches are played with uneven teams (such as 1-vs-2 matches in Story Mode where the human player is outnumbered).Mortal Kombat allows four human players to form two teams, with each player controlling only one fighter. This mode can be played online (with teams of two local players) and co-operatively in the Tag Ladder Mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with two Fatalities, which are special finishing moves (animations showing an gruesome and painful kill) that can be performed via special button combinations by the winning player at the end of the match. One of these combinations is visible from the start in the character's Move List. The other ""hidden"" Fatality becomes visible in the Move List either when the player performs the Fatality for the first time or unlocks it in the Krypt.Returning from the old Mortal Kombat games are Stage Fatalities (which can only be performed at certain stages and, unlike most 3D Mortal Kombat games, cannot be executed during the middle of a match) and Babalities (which transforms your opponent into a baby, this time showing a cutesy animation of the baby humiliating itself). The combinations of both Stage Fatalities and Babalities are completely hidden, requiring the player to have outside knowledge. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile also each have a hidden Classic Fatality (based on Fatalities from the first two Mortal Kombat games) that can only be performed if the player has downloaded their Classic Costumes. </div>  <div> Special Editions : The traditional Arcade Mode of Mortal Kombat, Ladder Mode requires players to defeat ten opponents, one at a time, each fight increasing in difficulty (though the base difficulty level is chosen before the first fight). The first seven fights are against random opponents in random stages while the final three matches are pre-determined (first Shang Tsung with his alternate costume and the ability to automatically transform into his opponent and two other fighters, then either Goro or Kintaro, and then Shao Kahn). Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> "
Mortal Kombat,Probe Software,Acclaim,"September 9, 1994",gg,"One of the goriest fighting game franchises returns to its roots, introducing a new story that re-tells the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games (with a unique twist).",3030-25042,25042,0,2011-04-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : The legend continues... from the beginning.Mortal Kombat (not to be confused with the original 1991 game of the same name) is a 2.5D fighting game developed by NetherRealm and published by WB for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 19, 2011, for the PlayStation Vita on May 1, 2012, and for the PC (via Steam) on July 3, 2013.Considered a rebirth of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Mortal Kombat drops the 3D fighting game mechanic from previous games and reinvents the 2D fighting mechanic of the first three Mortal Kombat installments, adding new features such as tag-team battles (supporting up to four human players at a time), an extensive battle damage system (which shows player characters getting heavily injured during the fight), and a three-tiered Power Meter (used for enhanced special moves, combo breakers, and powerful moves known as X-Ray Attacks).The game also features new mini-games (such as Test Your Luck, in which players fight a match after a slot machine randomly adds beneficial and detrimental effects to either player), the return of Kombat Kodes (in which both players, during the Vs. screen, can together input a secret code to change gameplay mechanics and other effects of the match), the return of Babalities and hidden characters (that can only be fought under rare conditions), a 300-part series of special matches and mini-game challenges (known as the Challenge Tower), an enhanced training mode, stereoscopic 3D support (for the PlayStation 3 version only), and an online lobby mode for up to eight players (in which the other players, as avatars in the Xbox 360 version and avatar-like characters in the other versions, watch the fight unfold and switch off after each match).The main single-player story retells the events of the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 3 in an alternate universe. Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use).

Ms. Pac-Man,Now Production,Namco,1995,gg,"A sequel to the arcade classic featuring Pac-Man's feminine counterpart. The game is notable for having a variety of mazes as opposed to the single maze design in the original game, as well as bonus items that wandered through the mazes rather than appearing just in the center.",3030-6332,6332,0,1982-02-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls). </div> "

Developed by EA Canada for seventh-generation game consoles, this rebirth brings back the gameplay, aesthetics, and gratuitous secrets of the original 1993 arcade game.",3030-29664,29664,0,2010-10-05,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-jam/3030-29664/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : BOOMSHAKALAKA!NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 arcade basketball game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports for the Wii on October 5, 2010. Originally a Wii-exclusive, it was later released on November 17, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring upgraded HD visuals and online play. (This version was originally planned to be a feature-limited downloadable title included with new copies of the unreleased NBA Elite 11, but was later made a retail release.)Unlike previous Acclaim-developed installments of the franchise, the 2010 installment features gameplay and aesthetics reminiscent of Midway's original NBA Jam. (With help from the original designer, Mark Turmell, who worked with EA Tiburon at the time, and Tim Kitzrow, the iconic announcer of the original game, who shouted famous catchphrases such as ""Boomshakalaka!"" and ""He's on fire!"").Building upon the 2010-2011 NBA roster, the game features a ""Remix Tour"" campaign (featuring new crazy features such as power-ups, new camera angles, and boss battles) and special ""legend"" characters (legendary former NBA players). The game also brings back special guest characters and easter eggs from the original, such as former president Bill Clinton, hip-hop band Beastie Boys, and Big Head Mode, while adding new, modern secret characters, such as presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.An enhanced version, titled NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on October 4, 2011. On January 11th, 2013, the online servers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the original game were shut down. </div>  <div> Gameplay : NBA Jam is a fast-pace arcade style 2-on-2 basketball game that plays very similarly to the 1993 arcade game of the same name. Their are no fouls in NBA Jam other than goal tending (interfering with the ball when it is on the way to the basket) and shot clock violation (24 second shot clock expires before a shot is taken). Since there are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.Trail of fireIf the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become ""on fire"" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.Game TypesIn addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 AI opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard's life meter is completely empty, the backboard's glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the ""paint"". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains power-ups. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.Magic Johnson boss battleCampaignsNBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson has the ability to teleport around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters </div>  <div> Standard Roster : The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season. Unlike the original NBA Jam, in which teams are divided in the Team Selection Screen into Eastern and Western conferences, this installment lists all teams alphabetically. Each team has 3-4 standard players, and most teams have additional unlockable ""legends"" (Former NBA players). </div>  <div> Hidden Roster : Southeast Division.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition,Iguana Entertainment,ArenaAcclaim JP,"February 23, 1995",gg,"Midway's signature rules-light two-on-two arcade basketball game gets revamped, now with a bigger roster and more features.",3030-14792,14792,0,1994-01-17,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-jam-tournament-edition/3030-14792/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : NBA Jam: Tournament Edition (also known as NBA Jam T.E.) is a belt-scrolling basketball game developed and released by Midway for arcades in January 1994.An updated sequel to the 1993 game NBA Jam, Tournament Edition revamps the player roster for the 1993-94 NBA season while fine-tuning the gameplay and allowing more than two basketball players per team to choose from (in which players can choose their team composition before and half-way through each game). It also features ""Tournament Mode"", which disables all cheat codes and special characters while reducing the ""rubber-banding"" effect in player-vs-player matches.The game received home console ports through 1995-1996, first for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Gear, then for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Jaguar, Sega 32X, MS-DOS PCs, and Game Boy. These were published by Acclaim, and most were ported by Iguana Entertainment, with the GB version ported by Torus Games and the Jaguar version ported by High Voltage Software. These versions include an updated roster (from the 1994-95 NBA season) and new game options (including power-up icons, ""hot spots"", faster game speed, and an injury system).Both early arcade versions and the console ports are known for building up their list of unique hidden characters, with the early arcade versions including guest characters from the studio's Mortal Kombat series (which were removed shortly after release) and the console versions including some NBA mascots, retired sports icons, the American rap group Beastie Boys, the American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Charles, Prince of Wales.Some of the console ports were later used for the spin-off College Slam, while the original arcade version later received a successor with NBA Hangtime. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the ""Turbo"" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the ""???"" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the ""Quick Hands"" and ""Max Power"" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include ""Power-up"" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : Hotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. ""Hot Spots"" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. ""Power-up"" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant ""on fire,"" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a ""Juice"" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an ""Injury"" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional ""Tag Mode"" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions. </div> "

For the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and PC, it's the first game in the NHL Hockey series.",3030-11129,11129,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-hockey/3030-11129/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : NHL Hockey was the first entry in a franchise that is now nearly two decades old, EA's NHL series. The game provided a much more realistic game than most (if not all) other ice hockey video games available at its release. NHL Hockey was the first  NHL-licensed title on the  Genesis, as well as the first game with an official NHL license since the 1980 Intellivision game  NHL Hockey. The Intellivision title was merely NHL-branded for marketing and featured no official teams in the game. EA's NHL Hockey does, however, feature licensed teams and logos. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay in NHL Hockey is similar to the game's successors. Players can pass, shoot, and hit, as well as fight. Fights will occasionally break out after hits and, unlike other games like  Blades of Steel, award no real advantage to the winner of the bout. The camera perspective is EA's characteristic vertical-scrolling view, rather than most other hockey games of the time which adopted a TV broadcast style.  </div>  <div> EA Hockey : The European release of the game was re-titled as EA Hockey and did not feature the NHL license. As a result, the teams in the game were national teams. However, the teams were merely cosmetic skins of the NHL teams featured in the North American product. </div> "
Ninja Gaiden,Japan System House,Sega,December 1991,gg,Ryu Hayabusa seeks revenge for the decimation of his clan and must recover a mystical sword. Take control of Ryu as he fights hundreds of tough enemy ninjas and more exotic foes with his trusty Dragon Sword.,3030-21876,21876,0,2004-03-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-gaiden/3030-21876/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Ninja Gaiden is a re-imagining of the classic arcade and NES franchise of 2D action platformers. Developed by Tecmo's Team Ninja exclusively for the Xbox, this action hack and slash game was praised for its fluid animations, deep fighting system, and intense difficulty. Players guide protagonist Ryu Hayabusa through sixteen chapters of combat, environmental exploration, and puzzle solving. It was later expanded with two free ""Hurricane Packs"" released through Xbox Live which improved the problematic camera, added a new quarterstaff weapon, implemented a new combat technique called the ""intercept"" which allowed for advanced counteracts, and included a large number of progressively harder stand-alone battles to extend the post-story content.Ninja Gaiden appears on the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility list. It originally suffered bouts of severe slowdown which interfered with the player's ability to properly time combos, but updates to the emulator eventually helped to reduce the problem. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Played from a third-person perspective, Ninja Gaiden specializes in fast, visceral 3D combat against multiple opponents including black ninjas wielding explosive throwing stars, armored soldiers with submachine guns and electrified blades, huge dinosaur-like demons which can breathe fire, and many more. These foes are highly aggressive -- unlike many similar games, they will not hesitate to coordinate their attacks to strike from multiple directions at once, executing continuous combos or devastating grapple moves to exploit any opening in the player's defenses. Every enemy in the game is fast, strong, and capable of dealing out lethal amounts of damage to send the player back to the previous save point.Fortunately, the player-controlled Ryu Hayabusa has a variety of upgradeable weapons at his disposal, superhuman agility which allows him roll safely away from enemy attacks and run several steps straight up most vertical surfaces, and the ability to cast a few different ""ninpo"" spells which can inflict heavy damage on one or more nearby foes. Fallen enemies also give off yellow essence which can be exchanged at shops for healing items, blue essence to heal up Ryu's wounds, and red essence to recharge his ninpo, and in the thick of battle, nearby essence can be absorbed to unleash immensely powerful ""Ultimate Techniques"" capable of slaying multiple enemies at a time.Combat can take place at virtually any point in the game, but between battles, players explore each level to find hidden items and solve puzzles to proceed to the next area. There are many variations on the theme of finding a key to pass through a particular locked door, as well as environmental puzzles where Ryu must use his wall-running ability or ledge-shimmying skills to avoid damage and gain access to a hard-to-reach place. In addition to free hidden healing items, most levels also include Golden Scarab jewels which can be exchanged at shops for unique items which cannot be obtained any other way.Weapons in the game include the Dragon Sword, a single katana considered the most balanced weapon in the game, nunchucks which sacrifice range for a greater attack speed, and a couple super-heavy weapons like the Dabilahro great sword and the War Hammer which are ideal for dishing out heavy damage against some of the slower, more heavily armored opponents. Each weapon can be improved at shops in the game to unlock new and more powerful combos. </div>  <div> Style : Some of the locales in the game include a traditional Japanese village, a futuristic airship, a modern military base, and ancient catacombs stretching deep beneath the evil Vigoor capital, evoking an anachronistic world similar to developer Team Ninja's Dead or Alive fighting game franchise. Enemy types vary in each level, and most chapters end with a particularly challenging boss encounter appropriate to the setting. </div>  <div> Story : Ryu Hyabusa visits Murai, leader of the ""Shadow Clan"" of Ninjas and his uncle. This visit is cut short when Ayane brings news that the Hayabusa village has been attacked. Ryu rushes to save his village, and the Dark Dragon Blade kept within it, but is struck down by a mysterious and powerful figure, who steals the cursed Dark Dragon Blade. Murai informs Ryu that the samurai that attacked the village was Doku, a Greater fiend from the Holy Vigoor Empire, and Ryu sets out on a quest for vengeance.To enter Tairon, the capital of Vigoor, Ryu stows away on an airship, and starts his search for Doku. In Tairon, Ryu travels to Hans Bar, to find out information, and meets Rachel. Rachel is a ""fiend hunter"" and the two converse.This is all being watched by Gamov and the Dark Disciple, whose identity is unknown, however as the story progresses, it is made clear that these two have been arranging events from behind the scenes.Ryu reaches a monastery, and after an exploration into the hidden underground, fights with Alma, a Greater Fiend and Rachel's sister. Ryu is victorious in the battle but Rachel cannot bring herself to strike the final blow, as she sees a small spark of humanity in Alma. This weakness results in Doku capturing Rachel. The battle in the monastery results in the military being alerted to the situation, and Ryu diverts to disrupt the armies communications, by destroying their tower.After destroying the communications tower, Ryu proceeds to the palace of Zarkahn, via the aqueduct, and eventually meets with Doku, who has Rachel as a prisoner. Ryu defeats Doku, and Rachel is freed, but no questions are answered and the Dark Dragon is with the Holy Vigoor Emperor. Doku vows he shall not be so easily defeated, and will bring about the Fiendish Awakening. Rachel seems to understand, and leaves before Ryu can stop her.Muramasa asks to see Ryu, and explains to him that the Dragon Sword has not reached its full potential, and needs a jewel to reach it. As Ryu travels on through the caverns and back to the center of Tairon, he realizes he has collected 3 stones that open up a pathway of portals that are activated on stone circles. This allows Ryu to find this jewel, and continue his fight for vengeance.The spirit of Doku has taken Rachel prisoner again, and uses her in a ritual to increase Almas power. Ryu defeats the Awakened Alma, and rescues Rachel, and leaves to deal with Doku, who has succeeded in bringing about the awakening. Ryu follows Doku to a labyrinth, and succeeds in killing his spirit, but as he dies, Doku passes on a blood curse to Ryu, turning him into a fiend. The sole way to relieve him of the curse and to retrieve the Dark Dragon is to kill the Emperor.Ryu infiltrates the palace of Zarkahn, and kills Marbus, the third greater fiend, to gain entry to the Emperors realm. Ryu eventually succeeds in killing the Emperor, but the caverns are falling down around him. He quickly rushes to the Dark Dragon Blade and is Rescued by Rachel. As they leave, the Dark Dragon Blade falls into the hands of the Dark Disciple, who has been watching all along. The Dark Disciple murders his assistant, Gamov, and reveals himself to be Murai. Harnessing the evil of the Dark Dragon Blade, Murai is turned into the Devil Incarnate, and fights with Ryu. Ryu is victorious and destroys the blade with his True Dragon Sword, shattering it. Despite Rachel wanting to stay with him, Ryu transforms into a Falcon and flies back to the Hayabusa Village, victorious.In a brief epilogue, Ryu lays the jewel back on Kureha's tombstone that it was found upon, in his village. </div> "

Phantom 2040 was released in 1995 in Japan, North America, and Europe.The game is based off of the television series of the same name (itself a spin-off of Lee Falk's classic comic series The Phantom), with a story that is similar to that of the television show's, but not directly taken from it. Phantom 2040 is an action game that takes place in the city of Metropia. The Super Nintendo version holds an average rating of 68% on Game Rankings, while there are no reviews registered for the Genesis version. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Phantom 2040 shares similarities with games such as Super Metroid.The gameplay of Phantom 2040 is similar to many other 2D side-scrolling action games. It contains many aspects similar to such games as Super Metroid and Bionic Commando. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings). Some of these endings, however, aren't considered ""winning"" endings, and rather prompt the player to try again. </div>  <div> Plot : Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.It is the year 2040.

Like the large bosses in the early Mortal Kombat games (and the dinosaurs of Taito's Dino Rex), all beasts are rendered with stop-motion animation as model figures (while the small human followers are digitized actors). The game features numerous blood effects, including an end-of-round fatality system.Along with major arcade revisions (adding new special moves and abilities), the game received numerous ports for home consoles and handhelds in 1995. Other than the SNES version (which was ported by Bitmasters) and the PC version (which was ported by Teeny Weeny), all ports were done by Probe. They were released in North America and Europe by Time Warner Interactive for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, Game Boy, Game Gear, Jaguar CD (exclusively in North America), 3DO (exclusively in North America), Amiga (exclusively in Europe for ECS and AGA systems), and PC (released for MS-DOS in CD-ROM format). It was also released in Japan for the PS1 (on December 13, 1996 by Time Warner Interactive) and Saturn (on February 26, 1998 by GameBank).Along with a short-lived toyline, it also received a four-issue comic book mini-series years after the game's original release. A sequel named Primal Rage II was in development in 1996, adding a new assortment of giant playable human ""Avatars"" (also rendered from model figures) to fight alongside the beasts. Although this sequel was canceled prior to release, some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) of the sequel have been found, one of which is publically playable. Despite its cancellation, both games received an overarching novelization in 1997 (titled Primal Rage: The Avatars). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Glorified execution moves, known as Fatalities, can also be performed this way at the end of the winning round. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground, giving back some of their vitality.

Prince of Persia,The Kremlin,Tengen NADomark EU,1992,gg,"A 2008 entry into the Prince of Persia franchise titled simply ""Prince of Persia"", this game stars an all-new Prince as he teams up with the mysterious Elika to fight Ahriman and cleanse the world of his corruption.",3030-20961,20961,0,2008-12-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Prince of Persia for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is the first, all-new Prince of Persia title for ""next-gen"" consoles. Rather than continue the tale of the last trilogy, Ubisoft decided to create a new world with all new characters. Prince of Persia introduces new gameplay elements and a fresh graphical style to the series. Prince of Persia was released on December 2, 2008 in the US.This game was created by Ubisoft Montreal, using the same core team that worked on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. This game is not a continuation of the Sands of Time trilogy, but rather the start of a new trilogy with a new Prince and a new world. The game runs on a updated version of the Scimitar Engine created for Assassin's Creed, which allows the game to be non-linear, yet still allow the Prince to traverse the land with his usual acrobatic prowess. </div>  <div> Story : The Prince and ElikaThe adventure begins with a new Prince of Persia, a wanderer, who is returning home from an adventure on a donkey named Farah with a king's treasure in gold, which he earned on his previous venture. Not yet the Prince to be, he desires nothing more then to spend his treasure on many luxuries, including women and liquor, and carpets very thick.However quite suddenly, he is caught in a fierce sandstorm and is blown away. When the sandstorm subsides, he finds himself in a mythical garden of beauty, dominated at its center by a massive Tree of Life. The Prince and a girl, Elika, find each other, and, in the same predicament, decide to help each other. Together, they venture to the center of this grand oasis. When they arrive at the center, they witness the destruction of the tree, and the freedom of Ahriman, the ancient god of darkness. After being set free, Ahriman starts destroying the Tree of Light and the land is full with darkness and evil. The Prince, with the aid of Elika and her new found magic, take up arms against Ahriman's corruption, in an attempt to drive it back and cleanse the world with light once again.With Elika's help the Prince travels to the four different locations: the Citadel, the City of Light, the Royal Palace, and the Vale to vanquish each of the four bosses. Once each boss is defeated the duo travel back to the temple to make sure Ahriman is sealed in the Tree of Light. When they get there they are confronted by Elika's father, the King, who attempts to stop them one last time. Upon defeat the King leaps into an abyss towards the Tree of Light. A second later Ahriman rises up in the form of a dragon monster and tries to kill the Prince and Elika. From the viewpoint of Ahriman you must travel around the room and heal the remaining areas surrounding the Tree. Once this is done Ahriman is captured back in the Tree, and Elika collapses. The Prince realizes that Elika has died, he understands now that Elika is giving bits of her life to heal all of the lands throughout the game. He now realizes that Elika's father only realized Ahriman so that Elika could live, it seems one cannot live without the other. The Prince lays her down outside the temple and travels back to the beginning of each area. In front of each of the four area's is a tree similar to the Tree of Light. The prince cuts down all four trees and travels back to the Tree of Light in the temple.One final blow and he cuts down the tree of light that you worked so hard to restore throughout the game, releasing Ahriman back into the world as the King had previously done. The Prince carries the huge ball of light to where Elika is at the front of the temple and places it over her. Elika then comes back to life. The final scene shows the prince walking away from the temple with Elika in his arms, as Ahriman in his full demon form flies overhead and out of the scene, released into the world once more. The final trophy/achievement for the game is awarded at this point, it is titled ""To Be Continued."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Healing the lands with light again.The Prince is able to traverse the land, with what has now become the standard arsenal of moves for him. He is able to wall-run, leap from wall to wall, swing on poles, and of course jump and hang from ledges.New to this game however are the inclusion of the Prince's claws called the Gauntlet, which are a sort of glove he wears on his left hand which can smash into walls and save him from falling, though neither battle wounds nor falling end up in Prince's death due to help of his companion Elika, who will save him whenever he is in danger. By using the Gauntlet he is able to slide down walls and even block attacks. The game also features a healthy smattering of environmental puzzles which the Prince can solve with help from his new friend Elika who aids him on his adventure, both in combat and adventure.Unlike other titles, the Prince will not collect new equipment to aid him in his journey. There is no special armor or gauntlet to collect in the game. The sword the Prince begins with is the one which he wields until the end, in an effort to make it a memorable weapon. Players will, however, gain new magical powers which Elika will use. Once the player has collected enough Light Seeds, they can be traded in at the temple for the player's ability of choice. These light seeds appear throughout every level once it has been cleansed, and many are challenging to obtain. The abilities which can be unlocked will allow the player to access new areas once inaccessible, as well as grab light seeds once unobtainable.The Hunter attacking the Prince and Elika.In the previous trilogy of games, the Prince utilized the Sands of Time in order to rewind time and fix any mistakes he had made. In this Prince of Persia, there are no Sands of Time, rather, Elika will help the Prince to jump higher and farther. Elika proves to be an excellent help throughout the game, and has been designed to help rather then hinder the Prince's success.Prince of Persia contains light puzzle elements, with one or two puzzles in each of the game's zones. The puzzles involve lever pulling, whether to put walls in place, or open floodgates. The puzzles are meant to add variety to the game which is heavy on platforming.Combat has also been changed, with a focus on one-on-two: the Prince and Elika versus an enemy. Elika is able to perform combos seamlessly with the Prince. The design philosophy driving the new combat system is to make each battle both more intense and cinematic. Fights are not as common as they were in the previous games, but aim to keep the player on the edge of their seat using intense, cinematic imagery.In tradition of the other Prince of Persia's, the game has great acrobatics.The combat system assigns attacks to four main buttons. Elika, the Prince's sword, and the gauntlet are all assigned to their own button, as well as one button reserved for 'acrobatic' attacks. The player can initiate a combo with any of the four choices, then continue with another. Both timing and attack selection are key to creating larger combos. If the player hesitates, they miss the opportunity to attack. Visual cues in the on screen action will make the player aware of the attack they should next perform on some occasions, and any other attempts will end the combo. These are usually reserved for combo finishers, however, as the first few choices are generally up to the player.The Prince can also block attacks and counter blows. Holding the block button will guard most attacks, but pressing it strategically will create an opportunity to counter. The player must beware, however, as enemies can also counter. The combat system also employs quick time events at various times throughout a battle. The player will need to repeatedly press buttons to push the enemy away or quickly press a prompted button to avoid a final blow. Throughout the game, the player will encounter a variety of enemies which require creative thinking to take down, such as The Warrior, who cannot be harmed by the sword, gauntlet, or magic. </div>  <div> Development : Prince of Persia's development team began conception right as Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released, however, tangible proof of the game was found when, on September 21, 2006 a leaked concept art hit the net. Ubisoft remained silent and made no comment. On January 23, 2008 some more screen shots from the game were leaked onto the internet, while the game was in it's conception phase. Once again, Ubisoft did not comment.In May 2008, Ubisoft finally released two videos of a concept artist designing the Prince and Elika confirming the existence of the game officially under the Prince of Persia title. One video shows a full-bodied new Prince being speed drawn using Photoshop. The other art drawing video detailed Elika and finally the third speed concept art emerged in July, 2008, this time depicting a prime enemy; The Hunter. Those videos may be seen here and here. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The Shapeshifter, relaxing at home.The Prince of Persia Epilogue content appeared the PS3 and Xbox 360 on February 26. It continues the story of the retail game, increases the difficulty, adds a new power for Elika and attack for the Prince, reveals a brand new location, and includes two unlockable skins that become available after completing the Epilogue.Jamal Rguigui has said that the Ubisoft Montreal team decided to go on ahead full throttle with some cool ideas that the team had during and post-production and developed a unique DLC that would enhance the experience for Prince of Persia fans. It was not content that was cut, but was content that was further polished and elaborated on. He continued to say that they had a lot of ambitions for the DLC and that they were filtering all the feedback from the industry and the community of gamers. Players can expect to have a specific experience that will give them more content with superior difficulty and pace. This is one of the most ambitious DLC projects from Ubisoft, and it adds to the understanding of Prince of Persia's new world and characters.New powers away!Elika will be receiving a new power that is called Energize which is a travel based power that adds a timing challenge. This power allows Elika, for a short period of time, to materialize an area of the environment that was previously destroyed. Therefore, the Prince and Elika will be able to access areas previously impossible to reach without this power. There is also a new enemy in the form of the Shapeshifter which is an enemy that takes the form of two of Ahriman's most fearsome Lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter. Though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player, it will requires a particular strategy to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the Epilogue. As mentioned the content will also include a feature called sprint clashing. When the Prince and the enemy are at a distance, the player can mash the acrobatics button, which will allow the enemy and the Prince to sprint at each other and attack. The new area is called the Underground Palace and it is completely corrupted. Ubisoft has listened to the feedback and upped the pace of the game with more aggressive A.I and more complex traps. The content will also have new Trophies and Achievements.It is not necessary to have finished the Prince of Persia game to play the DLC. This content is available both Xbox 360 and PS3 on March 5 for 800 MS points and $10 respectively. </div>  <div> Areas : Prince of Persia is divided into four different areas, each of which has its own visual style. Each zone is divided into six areas: one introductory area, four main Fertile Ground areas, and one final area behind a black gate.To reach the final area, the player must first heal all fertile grounds in the zone. Players can progress through each area as they choose, but are limited to the power they posses. Initially, all introductory fertile grounds must be healed to progress. Once the player chooses a power, however, they can choose which power they want, and Elika will inform the player which areas are accessible with each power. Each power will open up four areas in two zones each. The Prince can freely travel between each level with no load times as each is connected.The areas are as follows: </div>  <div> Bosses : The Hunter, who stalks his prey in The CitadelThe long abandoned guard post of the city, the Citadel is currently where The Hunter resides. </div>  <div> Music : The Warrior, who rules over the City of LightThe City of Light was once a place of wonders, but once it came into The Warrior's hands, it is now a place of destruction. The city was once a place where travellers would come to trade, scholars would gather to learn, and filled with beauty and life. </div>  <div> Limited Edition Offer : The Concubine, who resides in the Royal PalaceIn the Royal Palace, The Prince will encounter The Concubine. The Royal Palace contains a cavern, the Royal Gardens, the Royal Spire, the Spire of Dreams, the Coronation Chamber, and the Palace rooms. The Royal Palace is an area which holds many memories for Elika, and many important areas for the kingdom. The Royal Spire serves as the seat of power in the land, and was where Elika's father sat on his throne, and the hall of coronation, where the king receives his crown. The king and queen were wed in the Spire of Dreams, a place that was said to make one's dreams come true. Once upon a time, the Royal Palace was a place of wonder. Actors filled the cavern, and the lush gardens were truly a sight to behold. After Elika's mother died, the Royal Palace began to lose beauty. The gardens withered away along with the king's sanity, and the Royal Palace is now merely a fraction of its former glory. </div>  <div> Alternate Skins : The Alchemist, who resides in The ValeThe Alchemist claims the Vale as his home, dwelling within the Observatory, where he brings terror to The Vale. The Vale is characterized by many different, wondrous machines, which the Alchemist invented when Ahriman was free. </div>  <div> Penny Arcade Story Book : The HunterThe Hunter was once a prince, who lived only for the hunt. He would travel lands, far and wide in an attempt to face off against the most exotic and powerful beasts. After a certain amount of time had passed, and a certain amount of animals had been slain, the Hunter felt that there was no longer any creature alive that would give him the thrill of the chase. This is when Ahriman's voice crept in and offered him a solution to his dilemma. The Hunter was to offer his soul to Ahriman, and in exchange would be allowed to hunt for all eternity, the one creature that could pose any sort of challenge: man. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The Concubine used to be a beautiful women, who had the ability to trick any man she wanted into doing whatever she desired. She used her beauty and gift and became political. One day however she fell in love with a handsome noble man, and they were to be married. However a jealous women, came and attacked her, disfiguring her, and her face. With no way to return to her former beauty, the Concubine fled, and sold her soul to Ahriman, and exchange, she would have the ability to control all men. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The WarriorOnce a King of a great nation, the Warrior was forced into becoming a corrupted being. His kingdom was facing great problems and were constantly at war, and so Ahriman came to the Warrior and offered him great power in exchange for his soul and servitude. To protect his people, the Warrior accepted, and he was suddenly transformed into a great and powerful being. However when his enemies were defeated his people were scared and shunned him, and he realized that he had become the very thing he had fought.

Rise of the Robots,Instinct Design,Acclaim,1994,gg,"An infamous sci-fi fighting game known for its expensive marketing campaign (failing to live up to such lofty expectations).

The PC version was also released in a ""Director's Cut"" bundle with promotional content.Set in the futuristic 2043, players control a top-secret ECO35-2 combat cyborg as IT dispatches insurgent robots infected from a potent computer virus (the EGO virus) at Electrocorp's Metropolis 4 plant before the robot army (led by a sentient nanomorph known as the Supervisor Droid) infects the world.The game was known for its expensive marketing campaign, selling its high-detail 3D visuals (which were pre-rendered, similar to Killer Instinct) and advanced artificial intelligence (which changes certain tactics according to the player's fighting style). It also hyped a dedicated soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May of Queen fame, though it was instead done in-house, with parts of some tracks from Brian May's previous album Back to the Light included. Upon release, the game failed to live up to expectations and was widely panned due to its weak gameplay mechanics, controls, and aesthetics. Along with a novelization, the game also received a not-as-hyped sequel in 1996, titled Rise 2: Resurrection.It was ported to popular consoles at the time by Data Design Interactive., including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published in December 1994 by T&E Soft in Japan and Acclaim elsewhere), Game Gear (published by Time Warner in 1995), and Sega Mega Drive (published exclusively in Europe in 1995 by Acclaim).

A prototype of an unreleased version for arcade hardware was found, with numerous enhancements (including free selection of all combatants). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays like a traditional one-on-one round-based fighting game, with two combatants fighting to deplete their opponents' vitality.While it is technically a six-button fighting game, as each combatant has both and Kick attacks of three strengths each, some versions of the game (namely the original PC and Amiga-based versions and the CDi version) only use a single button for attacking, which is held down and released in conjunction with key/joystick input to determine the strength and attack type. </div>  <div> Characters : The game's main protagonist, the ECO35-2 Cyborg is a fully-functional bipedal android from Electrocorp's ""ECO Project"", housing a human mind and organs in thick armor plating. Due to its organic components, it is immune from the EGO virus and is thus used by Electrocorp to quell the robot uprising.The game's novelization further builds on Cyborg's backstory, with the organic components of the cyborg ""Coton"" cloned from of the CEO of Electrocorp, who he thought of as a father and swore vengeance to once the rebelling robots murdered him.It is the only playable character in single-player mode and is always in the Player One slot in the Versus mode (with the exception of the Military mirror-match cheat code).Special Moves:Turbo Head Butt (D, U + attack) - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Barge (B, F + attack) - A short range charge attack, useful for getting out of corners. </div>  <div> Story : The primitive Loader Droid is a simple all-purpose utility robot whose primary duty was to lift and carry heavy objects with its heavy retractable forked arms.

Ristar,Japan System House,Sega,"February 16, 1995",gg,"In Ristar, players control a star-shaped character who uses his arms to latch onto enemies and fly towards them, smashing them with his face. The gameplay is similar to that of Bionic Commando, except players can jump as well as grapple.",3030-16386,16386,0,1995-02-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/ristar/3030-16386/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Ristar is a platformer developed by  Sonic Team and first released for the  Sega Genesis in 1995 and later released for the  Game Gear the same year. The game has also been featured in numerous Sega game compilations, including  Sonic Mega Collection,  Sonic Mega Collection Plus,  Sega Genesis Collection, and  Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. The game stars the eponymous  Ristar, who must travel the galaxy and rescue his father while stopping Greedy, an evil alien tyrant who has enslaved the population and brainwashed the planet's leaders. The game was composed by  Tomoko Sasaki, who would continue to work with Sonic Team in the future.Ristar was created from early concept designs of the original  Sonic the Hedgehog. The idea of Ristar's extending arms was taken from a rabbit that would use its ears to grab enemies.  The rabbit was originally known as Feels.  Feels the Rabbit, in concept, was alleged to be the mascot for SEGA to go against Mario and Nintendo in a marketing fashion.  Allegedly, higher ranking officials at SEGA did not think that Feels was cutting edge and fast enough to compete.  The ideas behind Feels and his stretchy ears, which would eventually become Ristar's trademark stretchy arms, were put on the back burner for what would become Sonic.  Feels eventually continued development, in which he was changed to a star by the name of Dexstar.  Dexstar would change names a few times until the name of Ristar was finally settled upon after development.  Ristar would eventually be released on February 15, 1995 in Europe, February 16, 1995 in the US, and February 17, 1995 in Japan. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ristar's unique gameplay revolves around the use of the character's long, extending arms. Unlike other platformers, the player cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them, so the player must grab enemies and crash into them. The player must also use these arms to interact with the environment, such as climbing ladders, swinging from poles or knocking over trees. The player can also use his arms to reach areas directly above or below him. Like other platformers, the mechanics get increasingly difficult and the player must master the use of Ristar's arms if they are to complete the game. Another unique device in Ristar are cranks. Located throughout the stages, they can be grabbed, which spins Ristar until the player lets go. Using timing, the player can fly off in their desired direction to reach platforms, or to crash into enemies.The player's health is indicated by stars, which can be replenished throughout the level, located in chests. Yellow stars grant one point of health, while blue stars restore all health. Players can restore extra lives through pickups in the form of Ristar statues, or by gaining 20,000 points. Points are gained by defeating enemies, or through collectible gems.Gameplay in the Game Gear version is mostly identical, but features additional levels as well as a number of changes to original ones. Also included are stars that are scattered throughout the levels, which grant the player an extra life upon collecting 100, much like  coins in  Super Mario.The game is split up into 7 worlds, each two stages in length, as well as a final boss-only world. The first stage contains a mini-boss, while the second stage contains a main boss. Each stage also contains a bonus stage, which involve reaching a chest in a certain amount of time. If the player reaches the chest in less than a minute, they earn an extra life. If the player completes enough bonus levels, they will be awarded with  passwords upon completion of the game. </div>  <div> Worlds : Planet Flora: The typical Sonic Team first world: A vegetated forest which introduces the game's mechanics.Planet Undertow: A dry desert, containing the game's underwater levels.Planet Scorch: An industrial planet with volcanoes. It is filled with fire traps as well as vultures that will pickup the player and drop them in fire.Planet Sonata: A metropolis planet. The stage features metronomes that must be carried throughout small puzzle-like areas to give to birds, in order to continue.Planet Freon: The game's snow world. Containing things such as slippery ice platforms.Planet Automaton: A psychedelic robot world. The player must put to use all the skills they've learned in the game.Space City: The game's final world, a short stage followed by two bosses in succession. </div> "

Instead of blocking, the player will have to parry enemy attacks. The game has a dedicated parry button that the player will have to hit at just the right moment to counter an attack. Different attacks have different timings and parrying can be done on the ground and in the air.Shinobi has a multiplier system where players are rewarded for killing the maximum amount of enemies without getting hit. As the multiplier rises, Jiro's sword will begin to glow. Combos are executed by mixing different kinds of katana strikes (sweeping strikes and stabs) while throwing ninja stars at far away enemies. Said stars can be thrown in waves to eliminate a maximum amount of enemies.

In addition, players are given opportunities to sink a ball at a designated pocket to earn bonus points, bonus time, or bonus lives. It also features a post-round mini-game where players have one chance to make a specific trick shot. Home releases added the game of 9-Ball as an alternate multiplayer mode.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, the Game Boy in 1990, the Sega Genesis in 1992, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, and the Game Gear in 1994. These versions include various improvements, such as a new single-player progression system (where players progress by having high-scoring rounds), an improved spin system (with fine-tuned shots, massÃ© shots, and jump shots), and new gameplay mechanics (such as ""super balls"" and ""zones"").Along with its eroge spin-offs Pocket Gal and Pocket Gal Deluxe, the game received three sequels in Japan: Side Pocket 2: Densetsu no Hustler (which was released in North America as Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend), Side Pocket 3 (which brought the series into full 3D), and Side Pocket for WonderSwan. The original arcade version was also included in the Wii compilation Data East Arcade Classics. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Side Pocket, players control each shot of the cue ball in a top-down perspective (similar to other pool simulation games of the time). Before each shot, players have three options:They can select which direction to hit the cue ball using the joystick, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory. For precise aiming, the game has players holding down the joystick in a particular direction to begin rotating the cursor towards it.They can use the Spin button and the joystick to change which part of the ball to spin it. Home ports build upon this by allowing multiple levels of each type of spin (including hidden massÃ© shots). Left/Right shots curve the ball in either direction once it hits an object, Draw shots has the cue ball retreat once it hits an object, and Follow shots has the cue ball push forward once it hits an object. MassÃ© shots are unique in that it has the cue ball spin backwards (and optionally left/right) soon after it is shot, and can also be used to launch the ball into the air over other balls.They then perform the shot itself by hitting the Shot button (to start the Power Meter). The Power Meter swings left and right, and players press the Shot button to lock-in the power of the shot and hit it. In some versions, players can cancel the shot using a Cancel button. </div>  <div> Ports : In the standard ""Pocket Game"", players start each set with one of two alternate racks of balls: six balls in a standard pyramid formation (similar to the game of 6-Ball) or nine balls in a thin diamond formation (similar to the game of 9-Ball). Home versions also include a ten-ball pyramid formation (similar to the games of 8-Ball and 10-Ball). Players can pocket each ball in the rack any order, and the set ends when all of these balls are pocketed.Similar to other billiards games at the time, players have a limited amount of shots (or ""balls"") that deplete if the player either pockets the cue ball (for two shots) or fails to pocket any other ball (for one shot). Pocketing the cue ball also causes the other pocketed balls in that shot to return to the table. In addition, the Arcade version of the game has a timer that slowly depletes when the player is figuring out their shot (and can be replenished by pocketing balls). Once the timer or allowed shots depletes, the credit ends and players must add additional credits to continue. In Home versions, there is no timer and players are given more shots to start out with, but players cannot continue.At certain times in the round, one pocket is highlighted and if players pocket a ball in there, they receive bonus points. In the Arcade version, this can be bonus time. In single-player modes, this can be bonus balls. In Home versions of the game, having one racked ball remaining causes one pocket to highlight as the ""Zone"" and players can hit their cue ball in there to enter a special state where if they pocket the final ball in that shot, they earn additional bonus balls. In addition, the Home versions include a ""super shot"" where at certain times, hitting the 9-Ball or 10-Ball causes the table to have less friction (making the shot more hectic).In addition to points earned by pocketing balls and by bonus points, players are scored after each set by each sequence of balls pocketed consecutively and by each sequence of balls pocketed in a numerical sequence, with longer sequences earning more points. In Home versions, high-scoring sets are required to progress through the game. The game also includes a bonus ""trick shot"" between sets, where the table is set-up in a particular way (usually with obstacles) and players must pot balls in specific pockets without hitting obstacles in order to gain additional bonus points.In two-player multiplayer matches, players attempt to end a multi-set match with the highest score (with no ""trick shot"" mini-game). Players do not have a limited amount of balls to work with, instead switching between each player once they either pocket the cue ball or fail to pocket any ball. The Home versions do not include Super Shots or Zones. </div> "

It also borrows elements of the 1988 John Carpenter movie They Live, in particular the way Bart can see the aliens through special sunglasses. </div>  <div> Story :  Bart wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a UFO. He is the only one that knows about the alien invasion. Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of ""Maggie"", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the ""spin the wheel"" minigame. </div>  <div> Levels : Location: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: Maggie </div> "

Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles ""Tails"" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow. </div>  <div> Plot : Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven ""Chaos Emeralds"" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called ""The Special Zone"".Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him ""Tails"" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the ""Death Egg."" Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs. </div>  <div> Special Stage : The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies. </div>  <div> Two Player Versus Mode : Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it. </div>  <div> Compatibility with Sonic & Knuckles : By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cartridge into the top of the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge, the player will play as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles.There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Some minor changes to levels were also made so the player could find extra secrets or shortcuts using Knuckles climbing and gliding abilities. </div>  <div> Re-Releases : The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3Sega Mega Drive and Genesis Classics Collection for PCSega 3D Classics for the Nintendo 3DSSega Forever for Mobile PlatformsSega Genesis Classics for Playstation 4 and Xbox OneSega Ages for the Nintendo Switch </div>  <div> Zones : Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone has 3 acts and towards the end of the game Sky Chase Zone, Wing Fortress Zone and Death Egg Zone all have a single act. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The first zone of Sonic 2 bares more than a passing resemblance to Green Hill Zone from the previous game. Emerald Hill is set inside a tropical resort, featuring palm trees, rolling green hills, and wildlife-themed enemies like monkeys, fish and bees. Dr. Robotnik appears here, driving a drill-based machine that he tries to ram in to Sonic. </div>  <div> Development History : This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid. Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below. The player must avoid his attacks while remaining on a series of platforms, which feature panels that will successively rotate. </div>  <div> Trivia : This zone is set in the ruins of a sinking city as it succumbs to the depths of a lake. The low routes lead deep under the surface and features a significantly higher level of challenge, so players are advised to keep their heads above water whenever possible. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down. </div>  <div> 8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game : This zone is set in a series of giant pinball tables, featuring flippers, bumpers and a number of slot machines. Dr. Robotnik appears here at the bottom of the last pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik. </div> "

Space Harrier,Sega,Sega,1991,gg,"Play as a flying dude holding a large cannon as he takes on giant mechs, flying mushrooms, and fire-breathing dragon skeletons.",3030-6036,6036,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/space-harrier/3030-6036/,CERO: A," <div> Overview : ""Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!""Space Harrier (ã¹ãã¼ã¹ããªã¢ã¼ SupÄsu HariÄ) is a third-person rail shooter game. It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow & highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his ""designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D.""[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The bonus stage.The game takes place in a unique place called the ""Fantasy Zone"" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can. </div>  <div> Arcade cabinets : The third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: Absymbel </div>  <div> Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware : There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the ""rolling"" cabinet. The ""rolling"" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012. </div>  <div> Console ports : The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles. </div>  <div> Reception : Main CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MB </div>  <div> Trivia : GPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB </div> "

It is the sequel to Super Monaco GP, which in turn followed Monaco GP. Ayrton Senna himself is credited as being the supervisor to the game's development, as well as lending his name and likeness rights. The Genesis version is the most feature complete of the three. In it players can race through two main modes: Senna GP, in which players can race on a Senna-designed track, and World Championship mode. The world championship mode has two settings: Beginner and Master. The Beginner mode is a straightforward drivers championship, where the driver at the end of the season with the most points is the winner. The Master mode includes the concept of teams and rival drivers. In this mode, players start in a low ranked team with the objective of advancing and eventually taking Senna's place at the top of the food chain.Meet Nigel Mansell's unlicensed cousinPlayers can challenge rival drivers and replace them in the team if they won.The teams were arranged in 5 tiers with the master himself in a separate class altogether. The game only licensed Senna's likeness, so all the rival drivers and teams were slight variants on real ones. Even Senna's team in the game was an original team called ""Madonna"" as opposed to his real team at the time, McClaren.The tracks are relatively close to their real life counterparts, and Senna advised developers about track characteristics. They even followed the order of the real life Formula 1 calendar. Each track has some unique background elements such as a city or forest. Some tracks even feature rain on random occasions.Even with all these realistic elements, the game's handling can best be described as arcadey. This was a characteristic of console racing games of the time. More realistic racing games could be found on the PC, but for many Genesis owners, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II brought Formula 1 in to the home. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Upon release, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores: 6,8,6,5 adding, ""...this is a game that only a dyed-in-the-wool racer will love. The first SMGP set new standards in driving simulations and, while this version smooths out the rough edges, it does not break any new ground"". </div> "

Smash TV retains this same gameplay, using the left joystick to move and the right to shoot, allowing a player to move in one direction while firing in another.Evil M.C.The year is 1999. A new game show called Smash TV was created which puts its contenders to the fight for their lives. They will have to kill hundreds of enemies and collect money and prizes (from toasters to a big-screen TV). The inspiration for Smash TV seems to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, The Running Man. Two players can play simultaneously, and at the end of each of the three levels, the two players' performance is compared, with one being declared the winner.Each level ends with a boss battle. The first level pits the players against Mutoid Man. The second boss is a giant, round face named Scarface. The third level seemingly ends with a fight against two large, robotic snake heads called Die Cobros. But this is immediately followed by the game's true boss, the game show host himself called Evil M.C. This battle is essentially a tougher version of the Mutoid Man boss fight. </div>  <div> Home Versions : Super Smash TV for the SNES After its success in coin-operated form, Smash TV was brought to the home market on many different console and computer platforms. Home game consoles of the era were not equipped with multi-joystick controllers; alternative control schemes were implemented to approximate the controls of the arcade original. While some versions use buttons to fire in a direction, or to toggle a direction, others use multiple controllers' joysticks. Acclaim's SNES version of the game, Super Smash TV (referred to by its original name within the game), used the D-pad and face buttons to duplicate the two joysticks of the original. The SNES version also contains additional secret rooms.The Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is an emulation of the original arcade release, controls with its two joysticks. It is also the only version to include online play, letting two players play the game over the Internet.This game is featured on Midway Arcade Treasures for the Gamecube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC. </div>  <div> Achievements : Due to a glitch in the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, 360 users are unable to obtain the full 200 achievement points available in the game. The Game Master Achievement (in theory obtained by beating the game without continuing on default systems) does not unlock, denying gamers the game's final 50 points. The publishers have acknowledged the problem, but there are currently no plans to fix the issue. </div>  <div> Sequels : Though Smash TV never received a proper sequel, many of the same people responsible for the game went on to produce Total Carnage, a game that maintained the same control style and applied it to a vertical scrolling world, similar to Ikari Warriors or Mercs. There are plenty of references to Smash TV in Total Carnage. </div> "

As the player navigates the environment they will encounter enemies which the player can usually avoid by just jumping until they reach the boss which the player must defeat. Jumping does feature prominently in the game in the form of the jump meter. As the player jumps continuously they deplete their jump meter until they can only do short and low jumps. In order to traverse certain parts of the game (i.e. crates) they player needs to have a full jump meter forcing them to pace and moderate their jumps with a certain amount of precision. The player can also do a double spin jump higher jumps by tapping the ""2"" button twice and holding it on the second tap. On top of this the play can also throw fireballs or shurikens as well as equip bladed weapons. Finding random triangles will give the player the ability to summon Zatch a warrior ninja who can instantly defeat any enemy on the screen.In the options menu the player can go to the options menu at anytime to select weapons or check their character status. They can also go to the menu to ask Adam (the younger brother) for a hint. When selecting this option Adam will pull out his Sega Game Gear and a hint will appear on the screen of the in-game Game Gear. </div>  <div> Relationship to the Movie : Yup, the Sega Game Gear in a Sega Game Gear game.Surf Ninjas is an early example of a video game/movie tie in however Surf Ninjas takes this concept one step further. Sega of America wanted to have the Game Gear featured prominently in a film as a form of advertising for the platform. After contacting New Line Cinema the idea of Surf Ninjas seemed appropriate and Sega began development of the video game version of Surf Ninjas when the writing and story boarding process for the film had barely begun. While they received input from the director and writer of the film the developers took many liberties and released the video game weeks before the film's release. </div> "

After being awoken by a large explosion, he is told by a Flicky that the island is being invaded by an army of birds (known as the Battle Kukku Army, led by Grand Battle Kukku 15th) for its chaos emeralds.Unlike other 2D platformers in the series, Tails Adventure is played in a much slower and more methodical pace, as Tails will have to use a number of items (including weapons and special abilities) and backtracking to reach new areas in the island.It was later included as a hidden mini-game in the 2003 game Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut and in the 2005 compilation Sonic Gems Collection. It digitally re-released for the Nintendo 3DS (via Virtual Console) on April 2013 (in Japan) and June 2013 (worldwide). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The world map of Tails IslandUnlike games in the  Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, Tails Adventure is a much slower platformer that features several  puzzles, and an emphasis on back tracking and item collection. Tails' main form of attack is using weapons that he has collected throughout the game; his starting weapon is a small bomb.  Health is represented by a numerical value next to a Ring Item Box in the top left corner of the screen. The starting amount of health is 10 and as the player collects Chaos Emeralds the value will increase eventually maxing out at 99 once all six emeralds are collected. Health can be replenished by collecting  Golden Rings that are dropped by defeated enemies and blown up rocks. Tails also has the ability to fly but this is limited by a gauge that appears under the item icon; to begin with, Tails can fly for 3 seconds and maxes at 15 seconds.In total there are 26 items for Tails to collect across the game's 12 levels. Some items act as weapons while other items are used to solve puzzles, however the player can only choose to take four items into each of the games levels. To change the equipped item during gameplay, the player has to pause the game and scroll through them using the D-Pad. The player can see what item they have equipped by looking at the icon placed under the health.The equipment menuOne of the more useful items is the Remote Robot which is used to solve a large number of the game's puzzles and is often used clear the main path for Tails. When using the the Remote Robot, Tails stands in place while the player takes control of the robot. The robot controls very similarly to Tail in that it can walk, jump, and fly but it has many advantages that Tails does not; the robot's flight ability is not limited by a gauge and it can also walk on many environmental hazards like lava and spikes. If an enemy hits the Remote Robot, it will automatically return to Tails. The robot can also fit into small spaces that Tails himself cannot. During underwater segments, the Remote Robot will turn into the Sea Fox which was first seen in  Sonic Triple Trouble. </div>  <div> Item List : Regular Bomb: The only item the player starts with, it is mainly used to destroy blocks of stone and enemies.

It is placed directly where Tails is standing.Remote Bomb: The Remote Bomb is thrown like the Regular Bomb but this bomb will roll along the floor until it runs into a wall. The Remote Bomb has to be detonated by the player by pressing the 1 button a second time.Napalm Bomb: Also thrown like the Regular Bomb, the Napalm Bomb isn't lethal until it lands on the floor. Once that happens it creates a trail of fire that crawls across the floor.Triple Bomb: An extremely powerful version of the Regular Bomb.Wrench: This item is used in the Final Zone.Helmet: Tails pulls out a giant helmet and hides under to prevent damage from attacks. While using the helmet, Tails cannot move.Remote Robot: A small robot that Tails can use to collect items in areas that Tails himself cannot get into.Hammer: A melee alternative to the Regular Bomb, it can be used to kill enemies and destroy stone blocks.Teleport Device: When this item is used Tails is immediately transported back to his house.Night Vision Goggles: Used primarily in Poly Mountain 2, this enables Tails to see in the dark.Speed Boots: These boots increases Tails' walking speed.Super Gloves: The Super Gloves give Tails the ability to carry large items.

THQ released a title with phenomenal visuals and an impressive amount of customization for your entrance. They even attempt to mimic the camera angles popularized on the RAW broadcast, so you'll see the action from a long list of unusual perspectives.It also had a fairly unique game mechanic in that a health meter is replaced with a popularity meter. If the crowd is really behind somebody, you won't be able to pin them, which makes it vital that one really beats down on their opponent to win. You have to work an offense based on this, so spamming a certain move actually backfires as if you do a certain move repeatedly, the audience will cease responding to it and it will end up not doing much to actually defeat the opponent. If the man is pinnable and you do not pin them, the crowd will turn on you as well. Obviously, the more popular the wrestler (such as Rock), the more difficult it is to defeat them. It is possible, but it is quite difficult. The reversal engine is based primarily on timing button presses.The grappling engine seems to borrow, somewhat, from THQ's UFC titles of that era. The grappling engine hit a medium between the No Mercy and Smackdown series.There is no appreciable storyline in the game, something that had started appearing in wrestling games at about that point. The matches also tended to run fairly long. 15 minute or more matches are not all that unusual in WWF RAW, making quick pick-up-and-play sessions a bit of a challenge to pull off. And while the customization in your entrance is very in-depth, the customization of your characters appearance and moveset is far less in-depth. There is also no real weight classification. Anybody can do all of their moves to anybody else, no matter the size difference. Women wrestlers can bodyslam The Undertaker without a problem, for example. </div>  <div> Roster : Al SnowAlbertThe Big ShowBilly GunBradshawBubba Ray DudleyChris BenoitChris JerichoChristianCrash HollyD-Von DudleyEddie GuerreroEdgeFaarooqFunakiHakuHardcore HollyIvoryJeff HardyJustin CredibleK-KwikKaneKurt AngleLitaMatt HardyMolly HollyPerry SaturnRavenRhinoRikishiThe RockSpike DudleySteve AustinSteve BlackmanTajiriTAKA MichinokuTazzTestTriple HThe Blue MeanieTrish StratusThe UndertakerVince McMahonWilliam RegalX-PacShane McMahonStephanie McMahon-HelmsleyFred Durst </div> "

Each X-man represented in the center of the playfield has a corresponding mode, started by consecutive shots:Beast (left loop): Shoot past Wolverine to make the loop shot twice to start beast. Make additional loop/pop bumper shots to transform Henry McCoy from human to beast formWolverine (Bash toy): Hit wolverine a set number of times to start weapon X multiball. Alternate flashing shots to escape the facility (wolverine and just about any other lit shot)Storm: Hit the side ramp, and then shoot either cyclops or storm again to complete. Pop bumpers also appear to score in this mode.Rogue: Shoot the left inner loop twice to start Rogue. All hero shots are lit (including Nightcrawler). Hit at least two to steal the X-men's powers and complete the mode.Professor X (VUK): Shoot the Xavier shot twice to start ""find the mutant"". A silhouette on the DMD will show a character. Shoot the corresponding shot to complete the mode. Additional shots to Xavier will eventually light the required shotCyclops: Shoot the right inner loop twice to start the mode. Shoot the same shot again, followed by the Storm ramp, to complete.Iceman: Shoot the right ramp twice to start the mode. Shoot the right ramp repeatedly to complete.Phoenix: Shoot the right loop twice to start the mode. During this mode, Phoenix, Cyclops, and Wolverine are lit. Shoot Phoenix twice, or Wolverine/Cyclops 4 times to complete.Completing a hero mode lights their name on the center of the playfield, starting a hero mode flashes them. Completing all Hero Modes opens Danger Room multiball.Villain modes are started by shooting the blackbird scoop. Two of these: Brotherhood and Hellfire Club, require 8 hits each to the standup targets at the side of the playfield. Completing all villain modes opens Dark Phoenix multiball.Progress towards Magneto multiball is started by locking at least one ball in the center lock. Additional locks are lit by shooting the two targets on either side of the lock, and then by shooting either the Rogue or Phoenix shots. Locking 4 balls starts a 4 ball multiball. Alternatively, a number of hits to a captured ball will start multiball, although with a reduced number of balls. Scoring in the multiball depends on which hero modes have been completed-the more modes that have been played, the higher the jackpot, and only played hero shots are lit for jackpots, so there is a significant incentive to play as many modes as possible before multiball. </div> "
