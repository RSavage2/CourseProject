The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom, the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, the developer of the previous James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies, and by 2n Productions for the Game Boy Color. Versions of the game for the PC and PlayStation 2 were planned for release but were later cancelled midway through the development cycle.The Nintendo 64 version of the game featured a multiplayer mode that was absent from the PlayStation version. The Nintendo 64 version also supported both Rumble Pak and Expansion Pack accessories. The game features 14 single player missions that follow the story of the film very closely. Just like GoldenEye 007, the game featured three difficulty levels: Agent, Secret Agent, and 00 Agent. Completing missions on a certain difficulty would allow players to unlock additional multiplayer maps such as a dark Eastern European forest, a version of MI6's Scotland Headquarters and ski resort complete with working gondolas, and an airplane. The PlayStation version is known for lacking three levels, a level of difficulty and multiplayer modes.The campaign contained multiple gadgets and numerous weapons the player could use. Each weapon had a second setting on it, such as the SA90, which could switch between single and burst modes of fire.The World is Not Enough contained a robust split-screen mode found in most James Bond games. Players could customize their experience in various ways. They could choose what weapons they wanted to be available ( sniper rifles, explosive weapons, close combat etc.), choose how they wanted their avatar to look while playing in the game, have either vertical or horizontal split-screen, and select score limit and match time. Players could fight in teams, Free-for-All, Last Man Standing, uplink, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. During the game, players could pick up various gadgets and aids such as body armor and night vision goggles. </div>  <div> Weapons : P90Ingalls Type 90Meyer TMP </div> "

Its setting was also updated to reflect a more modern period. Much of the gameplay design still remains in tact, however, with a mix of puzzle solving and combat performed within a series of fixed camera angles. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each protagonist's gameplay differs in terms of the amount of action and puzzle related gameplay that the player will face with Carnby being the more action-orientated portion of the game and Aline's being more puzzle-orientated. Though the player can chose between either protagonist the stories of each of the characters both occur at the same time and interwoven together. Though there is no major difference in terms of how each character is controlled. </div>  <div> Story : Carnby.A thirty-three year old private eye, Edward Carnby travelled to Shadow Island to discover what exactly happened to his best friend, Charles Fiske, when Fiske was found dead on Shadow Island.

Edenshaw acts as an assistant to the player and will appear every now and again to reveal information that may or may not be necessary to the player. He plays a major role towards the end of the game. </div>  <div> System Requirements (PC) : Initially Edward assisted his brother in attempting to open the gate to the World of Darkness and made deals with Christopher Lamb in order to gain 'supplies' that he required in order to make further progress. Edward was revered by many for his work on the Abkannis tribe, though they were unaware of his methods of discovery. After a period of time, Edward realised just how terrible the things he was doing were and turned against his brother, Adam, refusing to assist him. </div>  <div> Availability : Charles Fiske, Edward Carnby's partner and best friend has been reported dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Carnby decides to investigate his best friend's death which leads him to meet with Frederick Johnson, Johnson informs Carnby of three ancient stone tablets that Fiske was searching for. The tablets are believed to unlock some form of incredibly dangerous power.Johnson requests that Carnby should take up Fiske's investigation and to search for the tablets. Carnby accepts that it is his personal priority however, is to find whoever killed Fiske. Johnson introduces Carnby to Aline Cedrac, a young and intelligent university professor. Aline accompanies Carnby to Shadow Island to help recover the tablets as well as to assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes is her long-lost father. As their plane nears the coast of Shadow Island, it comes under attack by a creature of the island, which forces them to parachute out of the plane. They are separated, Aline landing atop the roof of a mansion and Carnby landing in some woods nearby. </div>  <div> External Links : Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color by Pocket Studios and was first released in Europe alongside its console counterparts on May 18, 2001.

The Spider Aliens of the comic book are slightly humanoid, while those found in the game resemble over-sized bugs. You must save Earth from invading enemies, much like in the movie Starship Troopers released a couple of years earlier. </div>  <div> Gameplay : ScreenshotIt's a first-person shooter where each mission is objective-based.

Two-player co-op and standard four-player Deathmatch are supported.The game uses Acclaim's Turok 2 engine.

There are six levels and seven kinds of enemies. </div>  <div> Characters : Gunnery Sergent Harold ""Gunny"" LewisLieutenant Myra Lane </div>  <div> Reception : Although sharing the same engine as the successful Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game did not fare well among videogame critics. IGN wrote that ""Armorines is a Starship Troopers add-on to the Turok 2 engine. Nothing more."" The GameBoy Color version generally received higher scores than the console versions. The Nintendo 64 version generally received higher scores than the PlayStation version; GameSpot wrote that discussing all the bad things about the PlayStation version ""would be like flogging a dead horse"" and that ""elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here.""A sequel for the game was planned, but then cancelled after the game's poor reception. </div>  <div> Prequel Comic : A four issue mini-series was released by Acclaim Comics prior to the games release.

In this Xbox exclusive, players take control of the iconic teenage vampire slayer, Buffy Summers, as she punches, kicks, and stakes bloodsuckers. The game is a third-person action adventure title that focuses on hand to hand combat and simplistic puzzles. Encapsulated as an episode on its own, the video game is placed chronologically in the third season of the television series between the episodes “Revelations” and “Lovers Walk”. A resurrected Master appears in his sunken church as a phantom and he needs a body to assume a corporeal form. In the game, the story begins with a vampire attack on Sunnydale High School that leads Buffy Summers to other series staple locations such as a cemetery, the Bronze, and eventually down into the Master's sunken church. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Willow in her ""bad sweater"" phase. The game sticks close to the source material.Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an action adventure title with brawler-style mechanics. The player can lock-on target an attacking vampire and engage in fisticuffs. Buffy can punch and kick and chain these two button presses together to perform simple combos. She may also block and dodge enemy attacks when locked-on. Buffy learns new moves and adds the combo to her Slayer's Journal throughout the game. Some moves require Street Fighter-styled inputs to execute such as the flying triple kick which is Towards-Towards-Kick. She may also perform “clearing” moves as a spinning backhand or a spinning round house by rotating the analog stick one full circle and applying a kick or punch button. </div>  <div> Voicework : With a female lead, you should expect plenty of costume changes!Typically, enemies are vampires and undead and once their health is whittled away the Slayer needs to perform a finishing move. For vampires, the player can use a stake or any hand-held weapon or perform an environmental kill. Within the game world there are some sharp objects that protrude, for instance, from a stack of lumber which Buffy might grab and throw a vampire into. Some vampires may also be thrown off ledges into flames in order to be destroyed. Simple undead creatures need to be decapitated and Buffy can simple step on their skulls when the enemies are prone. </div>  <div> Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility : Xander's gift to Buffy.Weapons in Buffy the Vampire Slayer feature weapon strength bars which deplete over use.

They both make use of reflex-based puzzle solving with some later levels requiring a high level of dexterity and good timing to complete. The games use a darkly-humorous anti-war theme, reflected in the theme song ""War Has Never Been So Much Fun"" (which had lyrics in the Amiga versions of the game) and in the pre-mission screen where a queue of recruits line up in front of a hill scattered with gravestones - one for each soldier lost during the course of the game. Each soldier is uniquely-named (some after the developers), standing in contrast to the ""fodder"" in the game's title.The player is able to split the initial squad of soldiers into smaller groups and switch between the groups. Squads are armed with guns (primary fire) and with a limited number of grenades and rockets to destroy enemy buildings and vehicles. Missions are usually along the lines of ""Destroy Enemy Buildings"" or ""Kill All Enemies"". Some missions take place over a number of phases and different locales such as Jungle, Snow and Desert areas. </div>  <div> War Has Never Been So Much Fun : ...the game's tagline and opening lyric for the game's theme tune.

Playing as the titular character  Conker the Squirrel - fresh off his debut in  Diddy Kong Racing - players must rescue Conker's girlfriend  Berri from the villanous ""Evil Acorn"". Along the way, players must also retrieve their stolen birthday presents to advance to the next game areas, and participate in a variety of  minigames. These minigames include target galleries, slingshot shootouts, and even panning for gold. Players must also solve a number of simple  crate puzzles.Conker's primary mode of attack is a slingshot, which fires acorns collected from around the map. The slingshot can be taken into a first-person mode in specific sections of the game, including several shooting gallery set-ups. In addition, Conker can also attack enemies with his tail before acquiring the slingshot (or if he should run out of acorns). Conker can also push certain objects around the screen,  ground stomp buttons lying on the ground, and dig into dirt patches which transport him to other parts of the map.The game was put out after multiple delays of  Conker's N64 game, while it was still intended to be aimed at a younger audience. As a result, Conker's character in Pocket Tales is a far cry from his console game counterpart, featuring little dialogue whatsoever by the character (none of it containing any obscenities). </div>  <div> Backwards Compatibility : Perhaps the game is most notable for it's ability to be played on the only-then-recently obsoleted  Game Boy; a feature shared by only a handful of other Game Boy Color games. Strangely, when loaded on the Game Boy, the changes extend beyond mere graphical downgrades. Many of the game's levels are re-designed in order to compensate for the monochromatic color scheme, with some minigames being re-tooled / omitted as well.In addition, should the player attempt to switch between playing on the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color, they must erase their save data in order to do so. Which is to say, the game cannot be played and saved on one system, and then resumed on the other. </div>  <div> Reception : The game received average scores upon it's release - including a 6.0 / 10.0 from IGN. In  their review, they compliment the game's variety of gameplay, but criticize it's simplicity. The graphics received high marks from many, both in-game and during the ""pre-rendered"" animated sequences, while the music and sound effects were determined by critics to be ""lacking."" </div>  <div> Legacy : The game's mark on history seems to be limited to being Conker's first game solo performance in a game, and it's backwards compatibility feature. Whether or not the game is canon within the Conker series is matter for fans to decide, as Bad Fur Day makes no specific mention of it. The only constants between Pocket Tales and Bad Fur Day are the characters Conker and Berri.The nefarious Evil Acorn has yet to make his return. </div> "

The game takes place in a world where a nuclear apocalypse took place in 1997. The survivors of the disaster built a powerful floating tower, with which to govern the world and prevent nuclear war from occurring again.100 years later, humanity has reverted to an age where the ways of science are forbidden and the people rely on magic. However, the power-hungry Emperor Draygon revives the ways of science in conjunction with magic and attempts to gain control of the floating tower and its advanced technology.The player character is a young man revived from sleep in a cryogenic stasis chamber. He is soon tasked with the quest to collect the four elemental swords so that the world can be saved. The main character is named by the player. If the game is started without giving him one, he will be assigned the name "" SNK."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Crystalis plays a lot like the top down games in the Zelda series, but has more RPG elements. As the player defeats enemies, the hero gains experience points and money which can be used to buy new armor, shields, and various items. There are also spells which can be cast to heal damage, paralyze enemies, or shield from attacks, which require Magic Points. The level cap is set at 16. Gaining levels is required to beat the game, as enemies who are too strong will take no damage at all from attacks until a certain level is reached.In combat, there is a meter at the bottom of the screen which represents the hero's current sword's charge level. In addition to close range stab attacks, the player can charge up the sword by holding down the attack button while standing still. Letting go of the attack button will release the charge, resulting in a ranged attack. It is possible to move around while still maintaining the current charge level. Each sword has three levels of charge available, but special items must be obtained and equipped to use the second and third levels, and the third level charge attacks require MP to use.There are four swords used during the main game, representing the elements of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder. Although the swords have different strengths from each other, (E.G. the Wind Sword obtained at the beginning has the lowest attack power of the four) some enemies and most bosses have elemental immunities, requiring a specific sword be used to defeat them. </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Version : Crystalis was later ported to the Game Boy Color ten years later by Nintendo. Changes were made to the overall story, as well as the soundtrack. Some gameplay aspects were also altered, such as how elemental swords were used. In the original NES version, monsters commonly have elemental immunities that prevent certain swords from damaging them at all. In the GBC release, this immunity was removed, greatly changing the strategic element of the game. In this version of the game, the main character's default name is ""Simea"". </div> "

One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills). </div>  <div> Story : The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, ""What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally!

The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation..."". </div> "

The game had only been announced a few months prior during Nintendo's E3 2010 media briefing. It marked the revival of the classic Donkey Kong Country platformer series developed by Rare during the mid-90s for the SNES. In February 2013, it was revealed that Monster Games would develop a port of the game, titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the Nintendo 3DS. </div>  <div> 3DS Version Differences : Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is set to include all the content from the Wii original along with some new extras. Among those is an ""easy mode"" that provides the player with an additional heart, a back-up DK barrel that lets them call-in Diddy Kong in case he died and mine carts can take an additional hit. There is also supposed to be not-yet disclosed ""new content."" </div>  <div> 3DS eShop Version : Size: 17,668 blocks (2 GB) </div>  <div> Development : Donkey Kong's preferred means of transportation: barrel blasting.At around April of 2008, several members of Retro Studios, the developers of the critically acclaimed Metroid Prime trilogy, left the company. At the same time, Miyamoto expressed interest in bringing back Donkey Kong in a platforming game, notably in the style of Donkey Kong Country. Michael Kelbaugh, the CEO of Retro Studios, who worked on the original Donkey Kong Country games while he was with Nintendo of America, became interested in Miyamoto's idea, and asked to be the developer behind the game.Things began to move quickly, and the idea became a reality when they began development on this game. The codename for the game during development became F8 (read as Fate) after Iwata asked them to treat the game as if they were fated to make the game. Very early on, Retro Studios decided to base the game as a successor to the SNES games, to introduce fresh and new gameplay mechanics, while still being a relative of the original games.DK and Diddy Kong traverse the landscape.The development team debated what new elements they could add to the original gameplay, or if they should introduce anything new at all. When Jungle Beat was released, the team thought long and hard about in what ways they could make Donkey Kong Country Returns stand out. Retro Studios examined how in the original games, there were two characters, but the player never had control of both of them at once - and decided to change that.They intended to have real-time co-op play (New Super Mario Bros. Wii had not been made yet), but they found it difficult to create an experience that would be equal in single player as it was in co-op, so various additions to the Donkey Kong series over the years were also incorporated into the game. Examples include Diddy Kong's rocket barrel boost, which would help a less experienced player traverse obstacles.Retro Studios played so much of the original games that they consider themselves masters at them. During development, a lot of the game levels were made like speed runs, which Mr. Tanabe had to intervene to give the game a more platformer-like feel to the pacing.An example of the advanced environmental graphics.During the game's development a lot of emphasis was placed on sound design. Retro decided to keep the sound familiar to retain the nostalgic aspect of the game, while using the graphics to convey radical new ideas and themes; to keep a proper balance of style without alienating the fanbase. Thanks to the graphical capabilities of the Wii, everything in the game, including the backgrounds, is rendered in real time compared to the completely pre-rendered graphics of the SNES games.The other big changes are the absence of the Kremlings, which played a huge role in previous Donkey Kong Country titles as the main antagonists. Neither King K. Rool nor his minions make an appearance in the game but instead, are replaced by the evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe. </div>  <div> Story : The game's title screen.It is a peaceful day on the DK Island, that is until the volcano in the middle of DK island suddenly erupts and a huge tower know as the Tiki tower rise from the magma.That's when the players is introduced to the Tiki Tak tribe who instantly takes over DK island. 7 leaders from the Tiki Tak tribe spread around the island and hypnotize the animal life to do their dirty work (and act as basic enemies for DK and Diddy)The tribe's first action is to steal DK's golden bananas for some unknown reason, Diddy gives chase, meanwhile Donkey Kong himself is unaware of what is going on and becomes a victim for the tribe.As it turns out, DK and Diddy are immune to the tribes hypnosis magic, which gives the two monkeys a chance to make it to the top of the volcano and recover their stolen bananas.It is later revealed that DK's golden bananas have the ability to give life to new members of the Tiki tribe, as well as giving them more power. </div>  <div> Characters : Return's variation of the DK island, seen from directly aboveDonkey Kong: The king of the jungle is back. When his banana hoard of golden bananas is taken away, this huge gorilla gives chase.Diddy Kong: Donkey's pal and the second player in this game. If you play solo however he rides your back and can give you extra jumping boost and act as a shield of sort.Cranky Kong: Runs the shop in each world and will gladly make the quest a easier one for DK, if he got coins that is.Rambi: Is trapped in a crate in some stages, once freed DK can ride him to destroy some objects, he's pretty much invincible, the only things who can hurt him is thouching something hot or falling down a pit.Tutorial Pig: A little pig hiding in the scenes, he pops up now and then with important info, runs the check point and offering the Super Guide if the player has eaten the dust enough times on a stage.Tiki tak Tribe: The opposing force, out to take over DK island and the ones who stole the bananas. There is 7 leaders of them that acts as the games main bosses and a mysterious master mind who rule over them. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mine cart stages are now more hectic and chaotic.This game is a 2D platformer made in 3D, so-called 2.5D. LIke the previous Donkey Kong Country games it is all about guiding the big ape from point A to B while avoiding dangers and uncover secrets,then face the boss at the end of the world.The old games was infamous for having alot of secrets and collectables and it is no different this time, if you're going for 100% you will have to look around in each level carefully.Cannon barrels, Mine Cart and Rocket Barrels also makes a return.This game also have co-op 2 player mode New Super Mario Bros. Wii style. The second player takes the role as Diddy Kong. While this makes the game easier somewhat, your amount of extra lifes is shared, so it's important both players stays alive to make it through the stage. Diddy Kong will also appear in single-player where he will ride Donkey's back instead, giving him extra hearts, jump boosting Jetpack and infinite roll distance.Some differences from the previous games:Donkey and Diddy can now take two hits instead of just one.You can't control Diddy Kong in single player, he will ride Donkey's back instead.No swimming stages.Kremlings and K.Rool will not appear in this game, DK is fighting the Tiki Tak Tribe.Rambi the Rhino and Squawks the Parrot will be the only returning Animal buddies. Rambi does same as he did in previous games while Squawks helps the Kongs find secrets.Cannon barrels might launch you into the background or foreground.Graphics is in real 3D instead of pre-rendered. </div>  <div> Worlds and Levels : Ground slap: Stand still and shake the remote and nunchuck to pound the ground, this stun nearby enemies, activate switches and may shake something loose nearby.Roll: Shake the remote while running will make Donkey Kong roll a short distance, this will hurt enemies. With Diddy on his back he can roll forever.Kong Blow: Shake the remote while holding the controlstick down to make DK blow air, this can be used to solve puzzles and blowing air on things like bushes may make a collectable to pop up.Climbing grass surfaces: When you see grass on the walls or ceiling you can hold B and grab on it, allowing DK to climb along it. </div>  <div> Music : Diddy Kong is always player 2, or he is riding on Donkey's back in single-player. He can do everything Donkey can, but also have some extra moves Donkey can't do.Jetpack: He can use his jetback to hover in the air in a short time. Hold the jump button to use it. While on Donkey's back he can carry him too, and Rambi the Rhino. ( woah )Peanut gun: 2 player only, when Diddy do the Ground slap move he shoots peanuts in the direction he is facing, this can only stuns enemies. </div>  <div> Pre-Order Bonuses : DK and Diddy work together to evade fire from pirates.Bananas are all over the stages, grab 100 to get an extra life.They often mark where to go, lead you to hidden places and even makes a Puzzle Piece appear if you collect all the bananas within a area at some points in the game.BalloonsSometimes you will spot red balloons floating in the stage, grab it to get a extra try (extra life).In single player, you will use one balloon to respawn from the check point.If one of the players die in 2-player, that player can press A or 1 button to use one balloon to respawn as a floating DK barrel from top of the screen, the other player must then break it open to allow the fallen player to join the game again. If both players is dead at the same time, it will cost two balloons to respawn from the previous check point. (Only DK aka player 1 will respawn if you only have 1 balloon left)If you die with no balloons left it's Game Over and you're kicked out of the stage and back to the map screen. </div> "

Its original release for the Super Famicom in Japan (in 1993) came with improved graphics and eventually a fan translation, and later for the Game Boy Color which was localized in English for its North American release in 2000. While an otherwise faithful recreation, both games received a significant graphical upgrade similar to the treatment given the Super Mario All-Stars compilation.Both of these classic Japanese RPGs played an important role back in the Famicom days in laying the foundation of the genre. Many of the genre staples like a turn-based battle system and experience points are part and parcel of both these games. Dragon Warrior I (originally released in 1986) tells a very simple tale of a warrior called Erdrick (though the player can rename them) who must save the world from the wrath of the evil Dragon Lord. Dragon Warrior II (released in 1987 in Japan) built upon its predecessor's strength by increasing the number of playable characters from one to three and adding a more intricate plot, set 100 years after the original. </div> "

It is set in the year 2015, and depicts a scenario in which the United States and the People's Republic of China are drawn into military conflict with one another after China decides to invade Kazakhstan for resources. After choosing to align with either the U.S. or China, the player assumes the role of battlefield commander, directing upwards of sixteen individual platoons, usually consisting of some combination of tanks, wheeled vehicles, and helicopters, during a variety of different combat operations. Missions can have between one and three objectives, and while the player's initial forces for each scenario are always predetermined, each platoon can be assigned a unique platoon commander with specific strengths, and units can furthermore be transferred between platoons as necessary during missions. Force 21 also features a multiplayer component allowing up to four players to compete in scenarios either individually or as teams. In late 2000, a port of Force 21, developed by Code Monkeys, was released for the Game Boy Color. This port differed significantly from the original game, most noticeably by replacing the original's third-person perspective and three-dimensional graphics with a top-down, strictly two-dimensional viewpoint. </div>  <div> Plot : By the year 2015, advances in technology have all but eliminated the threat of global nuclear warfare, ushering in an age in which more conventional ground wars between powerful nations are an increasingly practical option. In more recent years, a shift in power has taken place within the Asian continent. As Russia slides slowly toward irrelevance, crippled both socially and economically, China expands and prospers, increasing its influence through the sheer force of its economy while also keeping a firm handle on any political dissidents. Realizing that their country cannot sustain its current growth rate over the long term without additional resources, China begins sizing up neighboring Kazakhstan and the weaken Russia, whose raw materials would help to further stoke the Chinese economy. Noticing a significant buildup of troops along the western border of China, the U.S. quickly sends a military force to Kazakhstan, hoping their presence there alone will be enough to dissuade the Chinese from attacking. Unfortunately, not even the added complication of U.S. involvement is enough to turn China away from its bid to claim oil-rich Kazakhstan for itself. Not long thereafter, the People's Liberation Army crosses the Sino-Kazhak border, and World War III officially begins.The trajectory of Force 21's campaign mode changes significantly based on the player's chosen allegiance. As an American commander, the player must push back against the Chinese advance into Kazakhstan and Mongolia before eventually advancing on China itself, buoyed by the support of oppressed rebel groups within the country who welcome them as liberators. As a Chinese official, the player is entrusted with the success of the initial Kazakh invasion as well as that of the subsequent invasions of Mongolia and Russia, allowing China to not only fully realize their goals but also force the American and Russian coalition to surrender. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players have access to a wealth of information even before entering missions.Force 21 is a real-time tactical wargame in which the player directs groups of units from the third-person, moving them and assigning them various tasks in order to overcome enemy platoons and accomplish mission objectives. Missions in Force 21 are separated into two distinct phases: the Preparation Phase and the Action Phase. During the Preparation Phase, players are familiarized with the details of the mission to come and given the opportunity to select individual commanders for each of the platoons that will be under their control. Commanders are rated from one to five in the areas of movement, combat, and detection, which determines their overall strength in these areas. Additionally, each commander is specialized in either Armor, Recon, Air Cavalry, or Engineering, giving units additional movement, accuracy, and detection bonuses when their chosen commanding officer is specialized toward their use. Apart from selecting platoon commanders, the Preparation Phase is mostly informational, giving the player access to three displays that fill them in on their mission's parameters. The Mission Briefing screen contains information on the player's objectives, the Mission Setup interface details units and commanders available for the coming mission, and the Intelligence pane allows the player to examine a 3D map of the projected area of engagement. Each subsection of the Preparation Phase interface is accompanied by a voice-over from an allied officer with advice for the coming mission.Two T-90UKs overlooking the remains of an enemy light vehicle platoon.Once the player feels they are sufficiently prepared to take on the mission proper, they may initiate the Action Phase, which starts the mission and gives the player full control of their platoons' actions in real time. Platoons can consist of up to five units each, and orders given to a platoon are carried out by all units within it. Orders cannot be given to individual units, however units can be transferred between platoons. Unlike many similar strategy games that allow players to freely scroll their viewpoint around the battlefield, the player's point of view in Force 21 is restricted to only what the currently-selected platoon's leader can see. This is accomplished by binding the game's camera to the lead unit of the selected platoon; the player can change the angle and orientation of the camera, but cannot detach it from the platoon. This restricted visibility in effect simulates the fog of war phenomenon, as platoons can only detect enemies within a short distance of themselves, and in turn can only be ordered to attack once the player has ascertained the enemy's location, thus placing a significant gameplay emphasis on situational awareness and effective reconnaissance. Players that are able to detect enemy platoons before they themselves are detected are at an advantage. Players also have both a minimap and a larger 3D Strategic Map to consult while in missions, with allied platoons appearing either as blue blips or letters corresponding to their platoon, and enemies represented as red blips.A detailed 3D Strategic Map is available for use at any point in a mission.Aside from reconnaissance, many other factors come into play when completing objectives and confronting enemies in Force 21. The game's environments can play a crucial role in successful encounters, as players can take advantage of beneficial defensive terrain features such as trees or use natural line-of-sight obstructions like hills to cover their advance. Platoons can be placed into one of four different formations (Line, Column, Wedge, or Reverse Wedge), which can have a noticeable impact on factors such as movement speed and weapon coverage. Choosing which units to engage the enemy with is also very important, as vehicles generally fall into specific categories, with some being more well-equipped to handle certain threats than others. Helicopters, for instance, are easily torn apart by anti-aircraft vehicles, while tanks similarly must watch out for fast MCVs with anti-tank weaponry. A number of specialty vehicles also exist that can perform tasks such as clearing minefields or laying bridges, and even general-purpose units may have additional command options that may benefit them in certain scenarios. A tank may be able to fortify its position against enemy fire, for one, and a recon vehicle might camouflage itself in order to reduce the chances of detection. Since missions are objective-based, defeating all foes within a map is not always necessary in order to proceed to the next mission, and failure conditions can also vary depending on the imperatives of the operation at hand. </div>  <div> Units : The Platoon Orders Menu is located at the bottom right of the player's in-game HUD, just below the platoon and formation selection interface, allowing easy access to common unit commands. Actions that can be taken by the currently-selected platoon will be highlighted, indicating that they can be performed, while orders that said platoon cannot be issued will be grayed out and unselectable. Issuing an order is typically done by left-clicking the appropriate button and, when necessary, left-clicking again within the 3D world view. Generally speaking, an order in the process of being issued can be cancelled simply by right-clicking the mouse.Move </div>  <div> Reception : Hotkey: MNormally issued simply by right-clicking the ground while the desired platoon is selected, the Move command orders a platoon to travel to a specified point on the map. Traversal over long distances can be ordered more easily by way of the Strategic Map; waypoints can also be set while issuing a Move order by simply holding down the Shift key while clicking.Patrol </div> "

Players control a knight (named Sir Arthur) who must battle legions of demons, ghosts, and other undead creatures in order to save Princess Prin Prin from Satan, King of the Demon World.Known for its unrelenting difficulty, the game was later ported to various systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (by Micronics), Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles, Sharp X68000, and Game Boy Color. The game received numerous sequels (maintaining the platforming feel of the original) and spinoffs (such as the Gargoyle's Quest and Maximo series). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Arthur starts the game with the lanceGhosts 'N Goblins is a side-scrolling action game with platforming elements. The game has six stages with a boss at the end of each stage. Upon completion of all six stages, the player has to repeat all six stages again with increased difficulty before finally beating the game. There are five weapons in the game: Axe, Dagger, Lance, Torch, and Shield. Sir Arthur starts the game with the lance, but can pick up other weapons as they are dropped by enemies. Enemies include zombies, red demons, dragons, ogres, and other monsters. The shield must be equipped to enter the final stage and complete the game.Ghosts 'N Goblins is often regarded as one of the hardest games ever made. It only takes two hits from any attacking foe for Arthur to die, and considering the player's supply of just 3 lives, completing Ghosts 'N Goblins is considered to be very difficult. There are, however, ways of improving both the quality of Arthur's armor and how many extra lives he has. Better armor can be found throughout the game in a few hidden locations. The extra lives are earned by first scoring 20,000 points, then 70,000 points. Thereafter, the player gains a new life for every additional 70,000 points they earn. </div>  <div> Weapons : WeaponDescriptionLanceThe Lance is Sir Arthur's starting weapon. It travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy.KnifeThe Knife works similarly to the lance in the sense that it travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy. The main difference is that it travels at a faster speed than the lance, but is weaker.TorchThe Torch, when thrown, travels in an arc and when it strikes the ground fire is emitted that damages enemies who touch it making it a powerful weapon. However, only two can be thrown at a time.AxeThe Axe travels in an arc similar to the torch and only two can be thrown at a time. The difference is that it can pass through enemies and doesn't emit fire on the ground. The axe is considered to be the worst weapon in the game due to the awkward throwing arc and its property to pass through enemies is not very useful.ShieldThe shield travels in a straight line like the lance and knife, but has a very limited range. However, it can destroy any enemy projectiles it collides with making it very useful. This weapon must be equipped to be able to enter the final stage. </div> "

The film hadn't done terribly at the box office, but sales certainly hadn't been what the film's creators were hoping for. A planned trilogy, the sequels were lying around and people weren't sure what to do with them. In the end, the concept turned into  Godzilla: The Series, a Saturday morning cartoon airing on Fox Kids. This cartoon actually turned out to be quite successful so... as one might imagine, a video game was to follow.    Crave Entertainment published and   Crawfish Interactive developed the game of the same name for the     Game Boy Color. Released in 1999, the game was played in an on-rails format. Players took control of the        towering giant himself and went to work in defeating numerous foes unleashed by a...         certain someone. Players could not move Godzilla left or right, but they could make him crouch; A and B functioned as attack buttons. Players went through the levels bringing down the military forces until reaching a monster boss at the end of the level. </div> "

The game is set in three different fictional cities:  Liberty City,  Vice City and  San Andreas. Each city is  loosely based on a real-life city. Liberty City is based on  New York, Vice City is similar to  Miami, and San Andreas is loosely adapted from  Los Angeles.The main character is dropped into the game world and does various odd jobs for the local  crime bosses. Progress through the different cities is done by earning money from completing missions assigned from various pay phones. </div>  <div> Evolutionary Differences : A number of major differences exist between Grand Theft Auto's design and that of the later games in the series:Mission failure is strict and inflexible. There is no option to return to a failed mission, it is simply gone forever.Money can be earned from  killing people and crashing cars.Three distinctly different cities are included. Subsequent games in the franchise would go on to focus on just a single city, with the  Grand Theft Auto III trilogy re-imaging the three cities contained in this game.The only modes of transportation are ground-based vehicles and walking/running. Boats, planes and other, more exotic forms of transportation were not included in the game.Support for internet and LAN multiplayer game modes. These would not officially return again until  Grand Theft Auto IV, though there would be unofficial patches to Vice City and San Andreas' PC versions to include similar functionality. </div>  <div> Characters : The PC version of the game lets players pick from eight characters while the playstation version only lets players choose the four male characters.

Grand Theft Auto 2 would have a similar top down style to the original game, but with enhanced game mechanics and graphics. This was the last of the Grand Theft Auto games to use a strict top down camera. The game was first released on the original Playstation in October 22, 1999 and then two days later for PC. Grand Theft Auto 2 was also ported to both Game Boy Color and Dreamcast. There has been some criticisms of all versions that the storyline was lackluster and that the rewards for completing missions was disproportionate to the cost of items in-game. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The PC version of GTA2 included IP to IP multiplayer. This means that there were no server browsers and that most games were privately hosted in an era when broadband connections still had relatively low market penetration. The multiplayer had severe lag due to this networking model and was called ""unusable"" by most users. It should be noted that once someone is in Multiplayer, the map is drastically reduced, and most AI features are turned off. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Head RadioApostles of Funk - Yellow ButterPussywillows - Real LoveDavidson - All I Wanna DoThe One - SouthparkBula Matari - Taxi DriversFlytronix - PendulumAnna - Do It On Your OwnTesting - My Tiny WorldStikki Fingerz - Holdin' It Out For YouConor & Jay - Vegas RoadTrack 7 - I Wanna PhunkKREZNegro Vs.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. Specifically, the game is based on the second book and film in the series of the same name. The game follows the plot of the book for the most part, although random missions were thought up to add length to the game, like multiple missions where Harry havs to save or help other pupils. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Inside Hogwarts.The game starts out at Ron Weasley's house, where some chores must be taken care of in which the player will play some mini-games.After that, the player gets sent to Diagon Alley. Here, the game actually adds the first additional gameplay sequence by expanding on the little side trip Harry makes.After this sequence, the player gets taken to Hogwarts, where the game begins in earnest.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Bully (Canis Canem Edit or Bully: Scholarship Edition), Rockstar's over-the-top highschool simulator.The player will need to take classes to advance the story. Upon taking one of the classes, the player will be sent into a backroom of the classroom in order to retrieve a spellbook associated with that class. The player will come across a spell that turns giant blue eggs into birds if the ""Transfiguration"" class is taken, while the ""Incendio"" spell that sets object aflame will be learned in the ""Defense against the Dark Arts"" class.In between classes, players can also take missions from pupils. The game has a day/night cycle, and some missions must be done during nighttime. When it's dark, prefects will roam the halls of Hogwarts, as well as the grounds outside. Like in the books, there is always a contest going on between the houses in points, which are gained by doing things well in the classes. If the player is caught by a prefect or Filch however, some points will be lost. Magical trick items like dungbombs and certain spells to distract these watchmen can be purchased.While missions are not being done, Hogwarts castle and the grounds surrounding it can be freely explored.There are some odd jobs that can be done as well. the player can become champion of the dueling club, trade stuff with fellow pupils, attempt to make other houses lose points and run people over with a broom. </div>  <div> Additional Information : The Lumos spell reveals more than might be imaginedThe player will eventually receive a broomstick, the Nimbus 2000. This broom can be obtained at any time while outside, though not in missions where the player has to go to the Forbidden Forest. This can actually be used to make certain missions easier, for instance; in one mission, school prefects must be avoided while trying to get across the school grounds in order to get to Hagrid's house. The broom can be used to fly across the school grounds, avoiding that part of the mission entirely. The broomstick can also be used to reach otherwise inaccessible part of the castle, like certain rooftops.There are huge differences between the PlayStation and PlayStation 2/Xbox versions of the game. For instance, while Harry travels to Diagon Alley with flu powder, things go wrong. On PlayStation, the player must attempt to keep Harry on the middle of the slide with the analog stick. On PlayStation 2 however, this sequence is not present at all, and the player simply gets dropped off in a cutscene. This is one of the few examples of the PlayStation game having more content in a gameplay sequence. For the rest of the game, this tends to be the other way around. </div> "

What started as a novel craze and moved into every other medium, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first entry into the seven part Potter series. </div>  <div> Story : The Philosopher's Stone maintains the passive narrative of the novel. Harry attends classes, and earns points for Gryffindor house based on the quality of his work, while the story waits for something to happen.While the stories of video game and novel Harry Potter hit the same main points, the actual worlds differ greatly. For example, video game Gringotts seems to provide money based on the amount a person can gather from the scattered vaults while being hurdled past them at breakneck speeds and dodging intentionally placed beams of wood. Even before that, the goblins force their patrons to collect documents scattered on their waxed, slippery floor. All just to strap into the mine cart in the first place.While the game is not technically proficient, or for the most part fun, it still appeals to the younger Potter audience eager to try their hand in the Wizarding world. </div>  <div> Collectibles : Harry Potter may choose to collect four types of Bertie Bott's All Flavor Beans. The video game Weasley twins trade them for secret phrases Harry needs to get past four portraits. Harry steals an unknown someone's hidden property, such as the Nimbus 2000, from behind these portraits.There are also 24 Famous Witches and Wizards cards to collect.

It centers around one of the most popular Grecian myths, that of Heracles, or, as he is better known, Hercules. The game involves a combination of skirmishes with random enemies and bosses, elementary puzzles, and numerous trading sequences and side quests similar to the ones found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The player can also play as two of Herc's friends, Lolaus and Serena (or the Golden Hind, as the half woman, half horse character is referred to in the game): they each have their own unique attacks and weapons. Legendary Journeys is known to have many bugs and technical issues (alongside its clunky controls) that make the game frustrating and unnecessarily difficult in numerous places. This game proved to be another high profile failure for the once beloved Titus as it continued to plunge deeper into the territory of poorly developed action/adventure games; directly following the release of the critically-despised Superman 64. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Though Hercules is the primary player character, the player does take control of Lolaus and the Golden Hind during certain moments of the game. Each of these characters have a unique control scheme; unfortunately, perhaps due to a lack of care in the game's development, the other two characters are both exceedingly difficult to control and considerably weaker than Hercules. Nonetheless, the character's attributes are listed below: Hercules - The strongest and most primarily used of the characters, Hercules' primary attack is the punch by way of pressing the B button. Upon holding the B button, Hercules can also use a ""super punch"" that does greater damage and can be used to break through weakened walls. Furthermore, although all characters will stun enemies after a certain number of hits (bosses excluded), Hercules is the only character capable of picking up and throwing enemies; instantly killing both the enemy and any other enemies with which the thrown one makes contact. Furthermore, Herc is the only character that can purchase potions from the tavern owner (who exists in all of the game's towns) that unleash lavish special attacks centered around four elements: earth, fire, lightning, and ice. The earth potion drops rocks from the sky upon his unexpecting enemies; the fire potion unleashes burning balls of molten lava upon Herc's adversaries; the lightning potion performs a similar attack by way of giant, thundering lightning bolts; and the ice potion temporarily freezes one's foe(s). These potions are accessed via the C buttons. Although Hercules is the most overpowered of the game's characters, his portions can be nonetheless difficult to play due to a weak camera and the lack of a lock-on system.Iolaus - The sidekick of Hercules, Iolaus is useful as the only character in the game capable of climbing vines (which have an odd graphical similarity to those in Ocarina of Time). However, once he has climbed said vines and reached whatever dangers await him at the top, he is faced with the difficulty of fighting with his exceedingly underpowered staff (perhaps he is Herc's sidekick for a reason, eh?). Iolaus is also useful in one instance in which the snowy alps can only be crossed by a body small enough to fit into the only available winter coat. Iolaus cannot leave any of his designated playable areas however, if the player tries, they are met with the message: ""Perhaps I should let Herc take care of this.""The Golden Hind - Though christened Serena in the television series, the game (for some unbeknownst reason) refers to her as The Golden Hind. This lady Centaur is, in fact, the weakest of the three characters. The Hind's only method of attack is the shooting of her arrows, done in a first person mode. Although the arrows can be shot in the standard third-person perspective, they are guaranteed to strike nothing unless the enemy lies directly in front of the Hind. The first-person mode is troubling however, as the controls are so unbearably clunky and difficult to use that the player will have almost certainly lost a considerable amount of health by the time he/she was even capable of training his/her sights upon his/her adversaries. Fortunately, The Golden Hind also has the smallest amount of game time between the three characters; and, like Lolaus, is restrained to her respective areas with a message identical to his. </div> "

Each faction has their own unique buildings, that are unavailable to other factions. For example, the Academy faction has the Arcane Forge, where an Academy hero may add artifacts to stacks of units, improving them in the process. Heaven faction has a special Training Grounds building, where units may be upgraded to a greater level (Peasants become archers, archers become footmen etc).Towns also have a town level associated with them, for each building the player builds the town level increases by 1, up to a maximum of 30. The player however, does not have access to all buildings. All buildings have a town level requirement, as well as a previous building being built in the list. There are no neutral, or unoccupied towns, each town is owned by a certain player.     </div>  <div> Factions : Heroes are your commanders on the battlefield. They command armies and expand your lands. Heroes have 7 slots, where the army is located. The hero himself is not limited to a certain number of troops, but rather 7 stacks of units. Each stack can have as many units as the player wishes. But each stack must only be made up of a single type of unit. The player may also choose to divide the stacks of units in other unoccupied slots. Heroes also have some RPG elements, these include.Attack - increases the damage all creatures inflict.Defense - increases defense of all creatures, reducing damage they might take Knowledge - Increases the amount of mana the hero has by 10 for each point of knowledge Spell power - Increases spell parameters, power and duration  The hero also has 2 other additional attributes, morale and luck. These attributes can not be raised by leveling up, but rather by skills or certain objects in the world (the increase from objects is temporary, and is only available for one battle). The higher the morale, the higher the chance that a unit might decrease the time between their next action in battle. Luck works in a similar manner to critical hits, the higher the luck, the higher the chance that a unit will inflict extra damage on attack.Apart from the attributes each hero has a level, heroes gain experience by defeating enemies on the field of battle. Each time a hero gains a level they can choose a new skill. There are skills that any hero has access to, and there are some skills that only heroes of certain factions have access to. A hero may only have 5 skill. Each skill also has sub-skills that become available, each hero can only have 3 sub-skills to each skill. A total of Heroes can also learn mighty spells, that can either improve the abilities and performance of the heroes army, or destroy and curse the enemy army. There are 4 schools of magic: destruction, summoning, light and dark magic. Destruction obviously destroys enemy armies, summoning conjures powerful elementals, light buffs your own units and dark magic curses enemy units. A hero can learn new spells either by visiting various objects on the worldmap or by visiting a mages guild in their town (the mages guild must be built, and it has 5 levels). There also higher level spells, these spells can be learned only by a hero that has a mastery of the corresponding school. For example, an Armageddon spell requires a mastery in the destruction magic school. A hero may take, and improve a magic skill on level up.Along with the attributes, spells and skills, a hero also has an inventory screen where they keep artifacts. There are 9 slots, each for different types of artifacts, shields, weapons, helms, necklaces, cuirasses, cloacks, boots and rings. A hero may only have 1 artifact equipped in each slot, the rest are simply kept in inventory.  Finally, each hero is unique, having a signature skill that no other hero has.    </div>  <div> System Requirements : The game is played either on a world map, or on a battlefield. The world map contains towns, objects, dwellings (where heroes may recruit creatures), recourse producing buildings, certain objects that increase a hero's attributes etc. The player moves his hero and manages his town from the world map, a hero has a bar that limits his movement, once the bar is empty a turn must pass before the hero can move again. Each turn takes one day, and a player may only build 1 building per day. As mentioned players will gain resources and gold each day.  The battlefield is where heroes fight against monsters found throughout the world, or against other heroes. They do not battle them by themselves, but by the army they command. However, a hero is very important to an army, as they increase the power of units, can attack enemy units or even use spells to help their own army, or hinder and destroy the enemy. Also, as mentioned attributes increase the power of the hero, who in turn increases the power of his/her units. Units that aren't commanded by a hero are weak, and are easy to destroy.  The battlefield itself is arranged in tiles, the entire battlefield has 12x10 tiles. Before the battle, the player may arrange their army on 2x10 area. Once the battle starts the player takes control of his army, that are divided into up to 7 stacks of units. Once the battle starts an initiative bar becomes visible, detailing which unit takes their turn and when, it also shows when the time for your hero's turn is. The initiative of each unit determines their turn. Units can preform several actions. Wait - they wait until their next turn. Defend - they defend for a turn, increasing their defense. Move - they move around the battlefield, to get closer or further away from enemy units. Attack - they attack an enemy unit (ranged units with the shooter ability can attack from afar). Use ability - some units have a special ability they can use to help their allies or effect enemies. Spellbook - few units also have spells, the spells they have are determined by the unit, the unit cannot learn any new spells. Each stack of units can only preform one action per turn. For example, you may command a unit to move next to the enemy, but if you did not command them to attack, they will simply stand next to an enemy. Once the action is completed, a new unit gains their turn, be it an enemy unit, or yours. The game has hundreds of types of units, but each faction can only recruit 7 types of units (14 due to each unit being upgradable to a better version) from their towns. Each type of unit has several statistics that include: Attack - Where as hero's attack attribute increases the damage of units under his/her command, the attack of a creature reduces the defense effectiveness of enemy units.Defense - Decreases the damage taken by enemy attacks (magical attacks ignore this parameter)Damage - Each unit has a minimum and maximum damage parameter. So for example, Archers have damage of 2-4, so 20 archers have a chance to inflict damage anywhere between 40-80. Hitpoints - Determines how much damage a unit can take before being destroyed. Archers have 7 hitpoints, so 20 archers would have to take a 140 damage before they are destroyed.Morale - Units that have a high morale act more in a battle, units with a negative morale may loose their turn.Luck - Increases the chance of a unit inflicting extra damage.Speed - The higher the speed, the more tiles on the battlefield a unit can cross (in one turn). Initiative - Creatures that have a higher initiative will have more turns than a unit with lower initiative.  </div>  <div> Prequel :  There are 5 campaigns, each with five missions. The campaign follows the events of Ashana during the troubled times of a demon invasion. The player will take control of many unique heroes, across 25 missions, each one varying in difficulty and length. Unlike custom scenarios or skirmishes, the heroes will carry over stat gains from previous missions, which is why it is advisable to visit each stat raising object before completing a mission. Artifacts collected by heroes, unfortunately do not carry over from mission to mission. The player must complete Campaigns in order, so that he or she may advance to the next campaign. The campaigns are as follow. Heaven (Human) Campaign - The Queen ""A king falls, a queen rises"" The Queen The Rebellion The Siege The Trap   The Fall of the King Inferno (Demon) Campaign - The Cultist ""A Demon must decide""The Betrayal The Promise The Conquest The Ship Agrael's DecisionNecropolis (Undead) Campaign - The Necromancer ""The Undead rise, the Griffin falls"" The Temptation The Attack The Invasion The Regicide   The Lord of HereshDungeon (Dark Elf) Campaign - The Warlock ""A hero is forged"" The Clanlord The Expansion The Cultists The March Raelag's OfferSylvan (Elven) Campaign - The Ranger ""Defending honor and country"" The Refugees   The Emerald Ones  The Defense   The Archipelago   The Vampire Lord Academy (Mage) Campaign - The Mage ""A mage confronts evil"" The Defiant Mage The Liberation The Triumvirate  The Alliance Zehir's Hope </div> "

The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch up to five blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Blocks are dropped in order of recency, with the newest block dropped first. Similarly, the player may launch blocks back up the conveyor belt in an attempt to ""juggle"" them to get the appropriate color ready. </div>  <div> Blob Ball : A Klax is the simplest pattern of three matching blocks. Each pattern is a multiplier based on the number of Klaxes it is worth. Four matching tiles in a row, as an example, are worth two Klaxes. Points are scored based on pattern size. The more blocks which are simultaneously removed, the higher the score. Empty space at the end of the round is also scored. After each round, the player may skip 5 or 10 stages, which results in a higher score multiplier, and more available drops. Difficulty is similarly ramped up faster. Stages have unique challenges, such as forming a specific pattern a number of times (""complete 5 diagonals""). </div> "

The game is published by Nintendo and developed by Flagship. The two Oracle games feature unique connection options, allowing players to collect treasure and objects using a link-up or password mode.The developers intended initially to make three games, all of them representing one part of the Triforce. Upon realizing that this system would be too difficult they canceled the third game and decided only to work on Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons release dates were very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The developers were indecisive as to whether or not they should add Game Boy Advance functionality to the game, because doing so might push back the release date and result in the game coming out after the Game Boy Advance launched. Luckily, the Game Boy Advance was delayed, giving them enough time to add the functionality and the games still came out one month before the Game Boy Advance. </div>  <div> Gameplay : An example of the side-scrolling gameplayOracle of Ages is a traditional Zelda game. Link explores the overworld, gathering clues and occasionally, items. After traveling about, Link makes it into various dungeons (eight dungeons are in this game, referred to as levels) and collects an item within each one that is normally used to go about the dungeon and eventually beat the dungeon's boss battle.A variety of areas in the game are not in the traditional Zelda style. Instead, they take a style more familiar with the Mario games. In these side-scrolling areas, Link can still use all of his items as usual.Introduced in this game are Gasha Nuts and Magic Rings. Gasha Nuts can be planted in certain areas around the overworld. After they grow, the seed on the tree can be opened for an item, normally a Magic Ring. Magic Rings can be appraised and then worn, for various effects, from transforming Link into an Octorok, to upping defense.The game makes heavy use of the Harp of Ages which opens up time portals to go between the past and the present. In the late game there are additional ""Tunes"" which don't require the usage of a portal to travel through time, allowing players to travel at will between the two times. There are many things that are changed between the two times. One example is that the Black Tower is not finished in the past, but it is finished in the future. Some other buildings also have slightly different layouts depending on the era.After finishing Oracle of Ages, passwords can be gathered in Oracle of Seasons which can then be told to various NPCs (non-playable characters) in the overworld. After telling the various NPCs the password, an item is presented to Link. Items vary from the Master Sword to a Piece of Heart. After collecting the item, the password given to Link by the character can then be used in Oracle of Seasons. </div>  <div> Story : The game starts with Link dropped into Labrynna. After walking around he finds a woman flanked on all sides by monsters. Upon Link's arrival, the monsters run away and the woman (who turns out to be Impa) asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. The two find the singer, who is Nayru, the Oracle of Ages, singing and playing her harp for the forest creatures. The demon sorceress Veran emerges from Impa and possesses Nayru's body which causes all time in Labrynna to go into chaos. Impa gives Link a sword and tells him to go see the Maku Tree, who tells Link that he must get the eight Essences of Time to rescue Nayru.After collecting the essences, Link faces Veran. The game doesn't end after the credits roll, unless Oracle of Ages is being played as a linked game. A cutscene is shown at the end of the game in which Koume and Kotake (better known as Twinrova) plot their revival of Ganon. A code is shown at the end of the game as well, and if typed into Oracle of Seasons when starting a file, the real ending of both games will be shown. </div>  <div> Linked Game : A unique feature of this game and Oracle of Seasons is the ability to input a password from one at the start of the other, turning the other into a direct sequel with extra hidden secrets and a continuing story. This can also be done by hooking up two Game Boys with a link cable, one with the beaten game and the other with the one the player wishes to have the progress transferred to.Example of a secret for linking the gameThough Link does not start the game with all the items from the other game, he does begin with the wooden sword (instead of having to find it at the beginning) and four heart containers instead of three. Certain characters will also know you as the hero of the land from the previously beaten game (in Oracle of Ages, Link will be known as ""Hero of Holodrum""), and you'll be reunited with the same animal companion as the other game as well.Beginning a linked game also expands the plot away from the main Veran story, tying it into the main series further by having Zelda arrive and get kidnapped by Twinrova, who are hoping to sacrifice her to bring Ganon back. The game then concludes with an extra dungeon and a battle against Ganon. (Side note: though both Ages and Seasons conclude the same way and behave similarly when the passwords are input, according to Hyrule Hystoria's timeline, Seasons takes place canonically first. It doesn't make a difference when the games are played, but if that's important to you, then keep it in mind when playing.)The last major aspect of the linked games are the inclusion of secrets, where certain characters will ask you to tell a secret to someone else. Upon telling the correct person the secret (a specific combination of characters), you'll be given a new item, generally an upgrade to a previous one, eg the seed satchel to a larger one. These are not necessary for achieving the ""true"" ending, but can give you items that you would be unable to receive otherwise, such as Bombchus. </div>  <div> Characters : Character DescriptionImage </div> "
The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons,Flagship,Nintendo,"October 5, 2001",gbc,3030-5895,"The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons is one of the two Oracle games released on the Game Boy Color. It features the ability to change the four seasons as Link goes on a quest to save the Oracle of Seasons, Din.",5895,0,2001-02-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-seasons/3030-5895/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Holodrum.The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons was released simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, and the two of them make the seventh and eighth games released in the Zelda franchise. The player once again controls Link as he travels on an adventure to destroy evil and rescue Din. There were initially going to be three games released simultaneously, but the complexity of the system made it an impossible feat and the third game was cut.The development of the game was handled by a company called Flagship. This marks one of the few times a Zelda games production has not been handled first-party by Nintendo. Oracle of Season's counterpart game, Oracle of Ages, focuses more on puzzles whereas Seasons focuses much more on action and combat. The two games can also be linked together via passwords to unlock new items and other things otherwise unobtainable during a regular playthrough of the game.The release of the game was very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The development team was unsure whether or not to include special functionality if a player plays the game on a Game Boy Advance, as they feared doing so might push back the release date and thus make the game come out after the Game Boy Advance. When the Game Boy Advance's release date was pushed back, it gave the development team the time they needed to incorporate the new functionality and still launch the game before the Game Boy Advance came out. </div>  <div> Story : In Oracle of Seasons, the Triforce drops Link in the land of Holodrum. He happens upon a traveling band playing in the forest and meets Din, the Oracle of Seasons. He then witnesses her kidnapping at the hands of the evil general Onox. Impa tells Link that they were headed towards the land of Hyrule and tells him to find the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree tasks him with getting the eight essences which will allow Link passage into Onox's castle. What follows is classic Zelda gameplay as Link attempts to obtain all eight of the essences.The player, as Link, then proceeds to collect all of the essences needed to complete the game. After acquiring them all in a variety of ways, meeting both unique and flat-out strange characters along the way, Link gains entrance to Onox's castle. He defeats Onox and rescues Din. Koume and Kotake (also known as Twinrova) watch Link from afar, plotting their resurrection of Ganon. If Oracle of Seasons is the link game, however, then Koume and Kotake begin to battle with Link. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A scene from early in the game.Oracle of Seasons is a traditional top-down Legend of Zelda game. In the game, the player (as Link) must traverse a variety of colorful dungeons to reach the ultimate goal of defeating Koume and Kotake (otherwise known as Twinrova) and rescuing the world from demise. Items and power-ups are collected on the adventure, allowing Link to do a variety of things, from jumping or creating blocks.One of the central items in the game is the Rod of Seasons. This item allows Link to change the season if he is standing on a tree stump. There are many things in the game which change depending on the season. Examples include lakes freezing over and trees losing their leaves.A new system implemented in Oracle of Seasons is the Gasha Nut system. By planting a Gasha Nut in fertile soil, a Gasha Tree will grow. The tree will produce fruit, which in turn will grant Link with an item of some sort (usually a Magic Ring, which can subsequently be appraised by a jeweler).Like its handheld predecessor Link's Awakening, Oracle of Seasons has some short sections in which Link travels with a side-view (as opposed to the traditional top-down view). These sections pay homage to the Mario games, and include enemies such as Cheep-Cheeps, Podobos, and Thwomps. </div>  <div> Linked Game : A unique feature of this game and Oracle of Ages is the ability to input a password from one at the start of the other, turning the other into a direct sequel with extra hidden secrets and a continuing story. This can also be done by hooking up two Game Boys with a link cable, one with the beaten game and the other with the one the player wishes to have the progress transferred to.Example of a secret for linking the gameThough Link does not start the game with all the items from the other game, he does begin with the wooden sword (instead of having to find it at the beginning) and four heart containers instead of three. Certain characters will also know you as the hero of the land from the previously beaten game (in Oracle of Seasons, Link will be known as ""Hero of Labyrnna""), and you'll be reunited with the same animal companion as the other game as well.Beginning a linked game also expands the plot away from the main Onox story, tying it into the main series further by having Zelda arrive and get kidnapped by Twinrova, who are hoping to sacrifice her to bring Ganon back.

Players control a little clown at the bottom of their playfields and try to arrange groups of tiles to make them disappear before a tile reaches past the bottom of the playfield. This is done by pulling down similar tiles (and throwing them back up) to match.The game includes two game modes: the one-player score-based Solo Play (where additional lines of tiles regularly drop from the top of the screen) and two-player competitive Battle Mode (where the second player can be human or CPU opponents). Similar to Tetris Attack, players can make ""chain reactions"" by quickly creating near-simultaneous matches to either boost their score (in Solo Play) or fill up more of their opponent's playfield (in Battle Mode).The original Japanese version of the arcade had a minor update, titled Magical Drop PLUS 1!, which fixed an issue with the timing window of chain reactions. This was used as the base for the international version, which also includes an announcer (to replace the character voices) and different sets of tiles (replacing colored bubbles with a random group of figures, including snacks, chess pieces, card suits, and slot machine symbols). The game received numerous sequels with the Magical Drop name, adding new characters while building on the game engine.The game was ported to the Super Famicom on October 20, 1995, reducing the length of the playfield. This version was later digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console) by G-mode on May 29, 2007. It was also ported to the Sega Saturn (on December 15, 1995) and Sony PlayStation (on January 13, 1996), changing the game's art style to pre-rendered 3D characters and replacing the design of some characters. The PS1 version was re-released in November 28, 2002 by Hamster and was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network (for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable) by Hamster on December 26, 2007. While all of the above ports and re-releases were released exclusively to Japan, the PSN version was later released internationally by MonkeyPaw in late 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A stack of random colored bubbles descend, the player's ""clown"" can then attempt to arrange them in stacks of three, which will cause them to be destroyed as well as any horizontally adjacent bubbles of the same color. Chains may be formed in typical puzzle game fashion either with a single drop, or by multiple drops in quick succession.The game is always played against either another human player, or a computer controlled player. Chain reactions cause the opponent's stack to descend at a faster rate. </div>  <div> Characters : Mitchell. It has six playable characters named for tarot cards:FoolMagicianHigh PriestessStarDevilChariotIn addition, World is a non-playable boss character that would become available in future games.Most of the characters were re-designed and re-named for the home releases; as an example, Chariot was re-named ""Mitchell"" and given a ""butt-chin"" in the PlayStation version, while Devil looks much the same, but was re-named ""Warilin"". </div> "

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first ""killer apps"" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked ""GOAL""). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no ""lives remaining"" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black ""enemy"" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time. </div> "

Now it's up to X and Zero (along with rookie Navigator Iris) to retrieve the DNA Souls, defeat the revived Mavericks, and foil the plans of the Soul Erasers.The game was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS (in Japan only) on December 25, 2013. </div> "

Instead, it is based on the Monster Rancher franchise, but put into card game format.   The player uses three monsters, each with a certain amount of hit points, and uses a deck of fifty cards to defeat the defending monsters. To do this, the player must put card from his hand into the Guts pile. When a player uses a card, it usually has an amount of Guts required on it, and whatever the amount of Guts is for the card, that is the number of cards that must leave the Guts pile. If a player does not have enough Guts in the Guts pile, the card cannot be used.   Each turn, a player draws enough cards to have five. If the player has five cards, then they do not draw. All three monsters and the player may attack once, which means only four attacks can be used each turn. A player can use Combos to make a Monster attack stronger. For example, Tiger can combo ""RightClaw"", ""Horn"", and ""LeftClaw"" for a combo of 7 damage. If each one was used alone, the attack would do 1 damage for each turn.   Players can win by either defeating the defending Monsters or by the opposing party not having any cards in the deck left.    </div>  <div> Story  : At the beginning of the game, a player may choose either to be a boy or girl. Whichever one is chosen, the story is the same.   The game opens by showing the character taking a test to get a Card Breeder License, meaning he or she can play cards and go to ruins. After three questions are answered, the player is given three Monsters. The player is then told to go out to the Ruins and defeat the player on the sixth floor for a CD which has another Monster he or she may use.   Once the first three ruin areas are complete, the player must take another license test for a better license, letting him or her go to even more ruins for even more Monsters to use. </div> "

The game makes a significant shift to 3D while introducing weapon-based combat to the franchise. The setting reverts from the gritty, Western look of Mortal Kombat 3 to mythical, Eastern look of the first two Mortal Kombat games.The game has three revisions within a year, fixing various bugs and adding new secrets, bugfixes and features. The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in late June 1998, the PC in late July 1998, and was a launch title for the Sega Dreamcast under the name Mortal Kombat Gold. These home versions added exclusive content, including new characters and FMV intros, biographies, and endings. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Color in 1998 by Digital Eclipse.Taking place after the events of Mortal Kombat 3, the plot of Mortal Kombat 4 revolves around the war between the God of Thunder Raiden (along with the warriors of Earthrealm) and the fallen Elder God Shinnok (along with the evil sorceror Quan Chi and their army of darkness). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Despite the transition to 3D, the game plays very similarly to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Players have four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick), a Block button, and a Run button. Players have a Run Meter to prevent them from abusing the Run button, which gives them a quick dash forward for offensive manuevers. Players can now sidestep left and right (by tapping the Run button twice), allowing them to dodge projectiles and move the camera so that other players can not pick up items on the ground as easily.The ""chain combo"" system is still intact, where players use strings of normal attacks to perform a pre-programmed combo. However, Mortal Kombat 4 has added a ""Maximum Damage"" cap, automatically breaking off combos (in a similar vein to Killer Instinct's "" Combo Breaker"").One main concept introduced to the Mortal Kombat franchise in Mortal Kombat 4 is weapon-based combat. Players perform a specific button and joystick combination and the character would equip a weapon (usually a sword, an axe, or a club). The weapon deals more damage and changes certain attacks (Fujin's Crossbow, for example, can fire bolts). The weapon is knocked out of the player's hand on the first attack landed by an opponent, in which that weapon can be picked up by either player by pressing down on the joystick and the Run button. Some stages have objects (such as rocks in Goro's Lair) scattered around that can also be picked up and thrown at opponents.Some mechanics from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 were scrapped, including Friendships, Babalities, Animalities, the ability to show "" Mercy"", eight-player tournament mode, and mid-match stage transitions. There are no Endurance Matches, instead bringing back 2-on-2 mode.This is the first Mortal Kombat game to not include palette swaps, as each character is visually unique. This also marks the first game to include the ability to select an alternate costume (by holding the Start button while selecting a character). </div>  <div> Characters : The fifteen playable fighters from the Arcade version.Mortal Kombat 4 included 15 playable characters in the original Arcade release, 7 of which are new additions to the series. It is the first main entry in the series where both boss characters are playable.With the exception of the handheld Game Boy Color version, all Home versions of the game added additional characters, all of which from previous Mortal Kombat games. This brings the grand total to 17 in the N64 and PS1 versions and 23 in the DC version.In addition, later Arcade and Home console releases included a secret easter egg that changes the player character's model to a bloody skeleton that was used in certain Fatalities (sometimes dubbed ""Meat""). A new original character was made based on this appearance in later Mortal Kombat games. </div>  <div> Arenas : Fujin - One of the last remaining Gods in Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, Fujin is the God of Wind and an ally of Raiden.Jarek (not available in the GBC version) - Believed to be the last remaining member of Kano's criminal organization, the Black Dragon, Jarek is a ruthless criminal who reluctantly assists Sonya and the other Earth warriors in defeating Shinnok's forces.Kai (not available in the GBC version) - A skilled African-American martial artist who trained under the White Lotus Society with Liu Kang before learning from great masters throughout Asia.Reiko - A former general of Shinnok's army who, after believed to be killed during Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, resurfaces to fight the forces of Earth hand-to-hand.Tanya - The daughter of an Edenian ambassador, Tanya unknowingly let Shinnok invade Edenia for his base of operations. While she appears to assist Earth's forces, her true motives are unclear.Quan Chi (sub-boss) - A dark sorceror who uses his abilities to free Shinnok from his imprisonment in exchange for being his second-in-command.Shinnok (final boss, unplayable in the GBC version) - A fallen Elder God free from his banishment to the Netherrealm, waging a war against the Elder Gods (particularly Raiden). His specialty is the ability to mimic the fighting style of any other character (similar to Shang Tsung). </div> "

These missions revolve around the destruction of illegal cyborg manufacturing facilities. The game features full motion video cutscenes that unfold the storyline for the gamer. The game itself doesn't utilize a first-person perspective for the action -- instead, Perfect Dark GBC features a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, much like what Konami did with Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and what Rebellion did with Mission: Impossible. However, at certain points in the game you'll be placed in a through-the-eyes perspective as well. This game also has a built-in rumble feature.Perfect Dark on the Game Boy Color was set in the year leading up to the start of the N64 game, covering her final test and graduation to full service as a Carrington Institute operative and her first mission. The game was played mostly from an isometric top-down perspective but included a variety of other game types such as a vertically scrolling driving section, a first-person sniping section and a number of different boss fight stages. The game encouraged stealth over action in keeping with the N64 game.The game made use of many of the features of the hardware. A two player deathmatch mode made use of the link cable, unlockable stickers could be printed using the Game Boy printer or traded with other players via the infra-red port and the cartridge had a built-in rumble feature. If used in conjunction with the N64 Transfer Pak, the game could be used to unlock four cheat modes in N64 Perfect Dark - All Weapons, Claoking Device, Hurricane Fists and R-Tracker. </div> "

It actually has a major influence on the game, for instance, some Pokémon only appear in the wild at night, while others will only appear in a certain day of the week. The Phone system is also present here, which debuted in Gold/Silver, some Pokémon trainers in the game will get your phone number and will eventually call you giving some hints about the location of items, Pokémon, or inviting you for a battle. This makes possible for some trainers to be replayed even after you beat them, most of them are still one battle only, like it was in the past. In crystal however, the rate at which trainser call you is reduced, and many offer you items they find. there are only 10 slots available in the phone's memory for calls, and any previous trainer's number an be deleted and re-added to make space for others. </div>  <div> Pokémon Gyms : The system where you have to get badges throughout the world to be allowed to enter the Elite Four and try to become the greatest Pokémon Trainer around came back in the sequel to RBY.

Here, players can find Pokémon with their hidden ability or items such as evolutionary stones and potions.Join Avenue is a special area which populates over time with players you interact with through WiFi or a local connection. Eventually, shops will appear which sell unique effects and modifiers for the player and their Pokemon. Shops can be levelled up by guiding customers to them, which improves the services they provide.Medal System is an in-game achievements system. Players are awarded medals for completing specific tasks such as saving the game 100 times or capturing all the fire-type Pokemon in the Pokédex. Players can then display their proudest achievement on their trainer card. There is also a rank given to the player based on how many medals have been collected 100, 150, 200, 250.Pokemon World Tournament is a facility in which trainers compete in a variety of competitions: all Pokemon under level 25, all Pokemon randomly chosen and all Pokemon level 50 with the ability to trade with your opponent before the match.

It modifies the game based on what the person you are linking to has done. For example, linking to a friend who has completed the game gives you access to Challenge and Assist mode. These modes alter the difficult of the game. Assist Mode makes the game easier by lowering the level opponent's Pokemon and making the AI less intelligent. Challenge mode makes the game harder by increasing the opponents level, gives Gym Leaders and Elite Four an extra Pokemon and modified movesets and makes the AI more intelligent. </div>  <div> New Pokemon Forms : Like the Generation IV minor sequel, Platinum, Black/White 2 adds new forms for existing Pokémon.

In this form, Kyurem has a higher Attack stat and access to the move Freeze Shock.

They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair.

Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers. </div>  <div> Plot : On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs. </div>  <div> Characters : Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience. </div>  <div> Releases : Rayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly.  </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution) : Globox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special ‘rain-dance’.  </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Following the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game.

Despite Shantae's initially poor sales the game eventually became a cult classic and fostered a passionate fan base. The game was released on the 3DS Virtual Console on June 20, 2013. </div>  <div> Story : The game starts with Shantae emerging from her lighthouse to realize that Scuttle Town, of which she is protector, was under attack by Risky boots, and her band of lousy pirates. When Shantae confronts Risky Boots, she discovers that Boots has stolen a Steam Engine from the villages Relic Hunter, Mimic. Shantae makes her way to water town, where she meets a buffoon by the name of Bolo, who knows where Risky Boots has gone. He leads Shantae to the Bubble Fountain. Once inside, she meets an imprisoned genie that teaches her the monkey transformation dance. She uses the monkey transformation to defeat the boss of the temple, which Risky Boots was unable to tame, and recovers the Dribble Stone. After being told that she needs to find the Golem Stone, her next destination is Oasis Town.After trekking across the desert and hoping over many a manticore and cactus, Shantae arrives in Oasis Town, where she is greeted by her old friend Sky and her friend Wrench. Sky sends Wrench to find the Golem Mines, where she suspects the Golem Stone is waiting.Shantae eventually comes across the Golem Mines, where she finds yet another imprisoned genie, and sets her free to learn the elephant transformation dance. She reaches the bottom of the mine and the location of the Golem Stone only to find that Risky Boots has once again beat her to it. Shantae reveals that she knows all about Risky's plan to use the relics to power her Steam Engine, and as Risky attempts to take the Golem Stone, a giant Golem appears out of the darkness to knock her away, leaving Shantae to fight the beast alone. She succeeds and recovers the Golem Stone.Once she emerges from the cave, Shantae is greeted by Wrench, who has a note for her from Sky. Sky says that she has found someone who knows the location of one of the magical stones, by the name or Rottytops, and mentions that she is part of the Zombie Caravan.Shantae makes her way to the Caravan and comes across a cart with a ""keep out"" sign across the front. Naturally, she goes inside, and finds Rottytops, who immediately challenges Shantae to a race, with the price of losing being Shantaes brains. When Shantae wins the race, Rottytops brings her to her next destination, the Cackle Mound Labyrinth, and the location of the Simmer Stone. Rottytops uses her femur to unlock the foreboding dungeon, and Shantae enters.Once inside, Shantae discovers that the Labyrinth is full of zombies and other undead creatures. She comes across yet another genie, who in gratitude teaches her the Spider dance, which Shantae uses to climb along the many spider webs around the dungeon. She manages to beat Risky Boots to the Simmer Stone, but still has to fight a creature in order to claim possession of it. Emerging victorious, Rottytops tells Shantae that the last relic should be somewhere in the area of Mount Pointy for the Twinkle Stone, and that Rottytops and her caravan would be moving in order to stay one step ahead of Risky Boots.Shantae makes her way past the desert into the mountains, and happens upon the sleepy village of Bandit Town, complete with its own tavern and resident protection genie. After speaking which the genie, who chooses not to reveal her name, she leads Shantae to the summit of Mt. Pointy, and unlocks the door to the Twinkle Palace, whose tunnels stretch throughout the mountain. Shantae finds yet another genie imprisoned by a monster of the labyrinth, and from her learns a dance that turns her into the flying harpy creature. She uses the power to pounce on top of the leashed dragon plaguing the dungeon and retrieve the Twinkle stone momentarily.As soon as she leaves the palace, the genie she met in the town below binds her with a magic spell and reveals herself to be Risky Boots. Risky takes each of the artifacts Shantae has acquired for her own and runs away to her hideaway. Not knowing where to find Risky Boots, Shantae meets with Mimic in Scuttle Town, where he suggests that she go to the highest place she can find and look out for Risky and her lair. After flying around in the desert in her newly learned Harpy form, Shantae comes across a platform in the sky with a magical telescope attached. The telescope talks to her, asking to look into her soul before she may use it, and decides she is worthy of looking through the device. She almost immediately spots Risky's lair, an island, and the Telescope kindly teleports her to the location.Upon landing on the Island, Shantae is immediately assaulted by an array of Tinkerbats with a variety of weapons, like mechas and pistols. She has to smash the pillars that block her path in elephant form, climb through the plumbing in her monkey form, and climb above spiked pits in her spider form in order to make it to Risky Boots office, where she drops Shantae into the hanger holding her new weapon, the Tinkertank! Unfortunately for Risky, Shantae makes her way inside the behemoth and destroys the artifacts, and in doing so destroys the vehicle. In a blind rage, Risky attacks Shantae with everything she has, but fails to defeat her, so instead tries to leave Shantae to blow up with the entire fortress.Shantae tries to fly up and out of Riskys cave in her Harpy transformation before being blown to bits, and exits the complex much like the millenium falcon exited the Death Star before passing out. She sees the four genies that she saved from captivity, and they offer to transform her into a full genie. Shantae declines, disappointing that she would be forced to leave her many friends, and instead elects to return to Sequin Land. When she wakes up, she finds Mimic standing above her. She decides to reveal to the mayor that she isn't a full genie, but in overhearing her conversation, the mayor reveals that he heard her confession, and says he doesn't care. After all, she saved the town and maybe the entire land from destruction and tyranny. The game ends showing a tinkerbat repairing the hole Risky Boots shot into Shantae's home at the beginning of the game while the resident half-genie takes in a little bit of sun. </div>  <div> Characters : Shantae is a half genie that is tasked with protection of the land. She spends her time protecting Scuttle Town while hanging out in her Lighthouse. When Risky Boots steals something precious from a resident of the town, Shantae goes after her in order to fulfill her duty. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Risky Boots, with Shantae and TinkerbatsThe most fearsome pirate on the high seas, Risky Boots is the leader of an army of robotic Tinkerbats.

It had different names on each platform; Burai Fighter on the NES, Burai Fighter Deluxe on the Game Boy and Burai Fighter Color in Japan and Space Marauder in the US on the Game Boy Color. The game has two different types of game play levels, described below. </div>  <div> Story : In Burai Fighter the player controls a nameless hero whose mission is to defeat the Burai and destroy their seven bases. The Burai are a race of super-brains, who for thousands of years have been trying to take over the universe. They can’t do it alone however so they have been busy creating armies of robo-mutants. They produce these monsters at their manufacturing bases, which of course must be destroyed. The protagonist has to face the five Burai: Giganticrab, Jawsipede, Fangskull, Torchwing and finally Slimdragon. They'll have an arsenal of weapons and their proton pack to aid them but even then, it’ll be a challenge. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling shooter that is unique from many other shooters for a variety of reasons. Burai Fighter is unlike most shooters as the game doesn’t just scroll from one side to the other, it often changes directions and takes different paths. Not all of the game’s levels are side-scrolling though: a few of the levels of played from the top-down perspective with the objective being to try to find a base and destroy it.Before starting these levels the player is given a map showing where they are and where the base is; yes, like a mall map. The game is unique from most other shooters in the fact that the player can freely touch any wall without being damaged. In fact it’s encouraged as there are many hidden rooms with goodies in them. When stumbling upon one, the camera changes path and moves into the room briefly then, once it’s scrolled all the way through, begins making its way back to the main path.The HUD shows the score, lives, current weapon, how many upgrades of that weapon have been picked up as well as a bar that fills up whenever ""Cobalt Bombs"" are found. The Cobalt Bombs are sometimes dropped by enemies and if the player can fill said bar, they will attain an extra life. The player can also press the A button if the bar is somewhat filled to do a special attack which clears everything off the screen. As the game progresses there will be weapon upgrades that flash between the three possible weapons. The player can continue to pick them up until that specific weapon upgrades to a better version. The first upgrade will occur when five are collected and the last upgrade with ten. </div>  <div> Weapon Details : Starter Weapon: The typical weapon, like any in any other shooter. The starter weapon shoots bullets the length of the screen.Laser: The Laser can be compared to the starting weapon in that it shoots a straight line and goes the distance of the screen until hitting an obstacle. At the first weapon change it shoots two beams, one in the direction the player's aiming and another in the opposite direction. The last upgrade allows the player to shoot four laser beams in an X pattern.Ring: When using the Ring the player shoots a circular disc that can go through walls; the starter weapon also shoots when using the Ring. The first upgrade shoots rings the direction the player's aiming and the opposite direction. The last upgrade makes the player shoot a disc in the opposite direction they're aiming and a spread of three rings the direction they're aiming.Missile: The Missile is similar to the Ring in that when shot, it'll also shoot the starter weapon. The missile however always shoots forward, even if the player is aiming in a different direction. The first upgrade makes missiles shoot to the left and to the right. The final upgrade shoots missiles in every central direction; up, down, left and right. </div> "

These versions include an arranged soundtrack and a bonus Training Mode (allowing players to practice against a dummy opponent). The PlayStation version was later digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on August 14, 2008. An enhanced port of the original was released for the PlayStation 2 in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation on June 13, 2006 (including new game modes and gameplay mechanics). A handheld version was developed by Crawfish for the Game Boy Color in 1999.A special ""back-ported"" version of the game was released (in mail order format) for Capcom's short-lived Japan-exclusive CPS Changer hardware (essentially a home version of the CPS-1 hardware, in similar vein to Neo Geo). The only notable difference with this version is lower quality audio. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes 13 playable characters (three of which are hidden with a cheat code), most of which are from the original Street Fighter, Street Fighter II, or Final Fight.Unlike previous games in the series, the game does not include the same final boss for every character.

Super Mario Bros. Deluxe,Nintendo,Nintendo,"July 1, 1999",gbc,3030-7314,"Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a 1999 remake of the 1985 classic, Super Mario Bros. It featured many updates from the original version including fixes for several glitches and the ability to play as Luigi at any time.",7314,0,1999-04-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-bros-deluxe/3030-7314/,ESRB: E," <div> The Original Super Mario Bros. : Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is nearly identical to the original Super Mario Bros. experience on the NES. None of the levels were modified in any way from the original set, at least when played through the first time. New to this version, you can save anytime onto one of three separate accounts and there are simple overworld maps depicting each of the eight worlds. As a new feature, the Photo album is comparable to a modern Achievements system, awarding small pictures or vignettes that can be printed on a Game Boy Printer. Also, the game now includes a battery pack powered leaderboard, making the points system from the original game matter. The Gameboy Color's screen is not as wide as that of the original NES's display, so developers compensated for this by allowing the player to go back a short distance, press up or down to look around or press Select to recenter camera. Those points aside, the game is a dead ringer. </div>  <div> Star Mode : When you finish the original game the first time, a new star designation goes beside your save account and the game starts over with some variations to make the game more difficult. For example, in star mode, all of the Goombas are replaced with Buzzy Beetles and all floating platforms are considerably shortened. The effects of this mode do not consistently increase the difficulty (unchanged enemies pose no more a threat than before) but completion does prove much more challenging for platforming-intensive stages. When you beat the game on Star Mode, the game lets you choose which level to play and on what mode in the account selection screen. </div>  <div> Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels : Other than the main game, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (aka The Lost Levels) is in this release, named Super Mario Bros. For Super Players. To access the levels, you have to beat the default high score in the leaderboards that are held by Luigi in the main game. The format of Lost Levels is nearly identical to the original Mario Bros mechanically and graphically but it is designed to be far more difficult than its predecessor (it's also much more difficult than Star Mode). In addition to demanding better timing and greater levels of finesse, the game actively tries to trick the player with bogus secrets and red herrings, the most notorious of which is a warp zone that takes the player back to World 1 from later Worlds. Lost Levels is also the relatively obscure debut of the Poison Mushroom which will harm Mario when touched. As with the Super Nintendo version, the game removes the final 9th and A to D worlds, and differences in gameplay between Mario and Luigi. </div>  <div> Challenge Mode : One of the new modes is a challenge mode where each of the original 32 levels have special items hidden in them for Mario to find. The player can choose any level they have beaten on a save in the original game. Challenge Mode has three goals for each level: finding five special red coins, finding the Yoshi egg, and achieving a score by the end (determined by the development team). There is only one Challenge Mode account and it can be reset if desired. </div>  <div> You vs. Boo : Another new mode is a versus mode either against Luigi or Boo in a race to the flag. This can be done either as a singleplayer to two-player game with a link cable. The objective is to dodge a level full of obstacles, traps, and hazards to beat your opponent to the flag. There are eight levels to choose from and though they are graphically similar to the original game, none of the level designs are taken from the original. Each map has a series of buttons that players can hit to change the status of certain blocks, altering their existence or spikiness. There are two states the buttons toggle and one is beneficial to each contestant, striking a balance between making sure the layout is ideal and just gunning for the flag.Boo is your opponent when playing against the computer and he simply floats by at a constant rate in the background instead of being blocked by obstacles, making these much more of a race against the clock than the multiplayer version. However, the computer will switch the state of the blocks in the level at a fairly constant rate, so this danger is not averted. </div>  <div> Toad's Toy Box : Every time the player makes significant progress in a mode or in the original game, things open up in Toad's Toy Box. The calendar, is just a basic calendar showing the current date, but goes on from 1 AD to 3000 AD, and has some filled out dates such as the original Japanese release date for Super Mario Bros. The fortune teller just shows a random item and a small fortune text like a fortune cookie, and occasionally a Super Fortune, awarding 5 extra lives in all games. The ""?"" room gets filled with Toads as you rescue them in the game, playing out little animations and unlocking more pictures printable via the GameBoy Printer. The last ones open up a simple music creator similar to Mario Paint, and you can redo the iconic opening music. ""Where's Yoshi?"" section is a randomized hint machine that will choose random levels and show the approximate location of the Yoshi Egg in them for Challenge Mode. </div>  <div> Secrets : To start a game with 10 lives (new file), go to the toy box, and select the fortune teller option. Now pick a card. Keep on picking until you get an ""Extremely Lucky"" card, and you should see a 5-Up on the card.now you can start a game with 10 instead of 5 lives. </div> "

Initially scheduled for Fall 2012, release was pushed after Crystal Dynamics received a directive from Square Enix President Yoichi Wada to make the best game that they could possibly make. It was finally released on March 5, 2013 to general acclaim. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like its precursors, the new Tomb Raider involves a mix of puzzle solving, platforming and combat in an open world environment. In terms of tone and mechanics, however, the game is more serious and realistic – Lara does not dive in slow motion while using dual pistols with pinpoint lock-on accuracy, but rather takes cover behind the environment and eliminates enemies with a carefully aimed arrow from her bow. Unlike the typical franchise enemy roster, consisting largely of various wild animals, players' opponents in this game are almost universally human, with few exceptions. This decreased diversity is offset by an increased depth to the combat. Lara uses four different ranged weapons, each with its own unlockable upgrades, alt-fire mode, and out-of-combat utility. Upgrading weapons requires resources in the form of salvage which can be found in various containers throughout the island or by looting corpses. She can also use salvage to unlock limited close-combat capabilities, being able to dodge and counterattack, as well as perform executions on incapacitated enemies.Action-packed sequences abound.Tomb Raider's platforming follows in the vein of the Uncharted series, with cinematic set-pieces and dynamic features, as well as limited use of quick-time events. These set-pieces led to some initial negative publicity for the game (the first in the franchise to receive an 'M' ESRB rating), as failure frequently results in gruesome, fully-animated deaths, such as being impaled through the chin or crushed under a boulder. Increased control over jumps and the ability to scramble up walls, among other enhancements, make the platforming feel more polished mechanically than previously in the franchise. Puzzle-solving is also a more active process, as Lara must take into account variable elements such as fire, wind, and momentum. To aid her, Lara can activate her ""Survival Instinct"" at any time while standing still, which will highlight objectives, enemies, collectibles, and interactive elements.Base Camps allow Lara to fast travel across the island. These camps are also where the player upgrades Lara's skills and weapons. Use of fast travel is essential for getting all the collectibles, as many are hidden or blocked behind obstacles that Lara obtains the tools to overcome later in the game. These collectibles include journals from past island inhabitants and the Endurance crew, relics reflecting the island's legacy, and GPS markers which reveal hidden caches. They can be found through exploration, by use of Survival Instinct, or by clearing each area's tomb to retrieve the treasure map at the end. </div>  <div> Story : Don't look down.Travelling aboard the Endurance, Lara and her boss, archaeologist Dr. James Whitman, are seeking the ruins of the legendary island of Yamatai, which was ruled by the shamanistic Sun Queen, Himiko. Accompanying Lara is the Endurance's captain, Lara's mentor Conrad Roth, as well as her friend of Japanese descent, Samantha, who is fascinated by the story of Himiko. For Lara, the quest is inherited from her father, also an archaeologist, while for Dr. Whitman the primary appeal is as material for a TV series. Against Dr. Whitman's wishes, they follow Lara's hunch that Yamatai is to be found in the Dragon's Triangle, an infamously stormy and dangerous area of the ocean southeast of Japan. The Endurance is caught in a raging squall and shipwrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors soon encounter a band of homicidal madmen, and are split up in the ensuing melee. Most of the game focuses on Lara's journeys across the island to reunite with and rescue her friends, and find a way home. Early on, she manages to send an SOS message, and a plane arrives to evacuate the survivors. However, a freak localized storm forms and strikes the plane from the sky.Trial by fire.As she fights the hostile inhabitants of Yamatai it is revealed that they are a fanatical cult led by the ruthless and insane Father Mathias, who was stranded there in 1982. As more people are shipwrecked by the Dragon Triangle's storms, the men are captured, tortured, and indoctrinated into the Solarii, the warrior core of the cult. The women, however, can be found crucified and burned to death across the island in some twisted ritual. Lara eventually reunites with most of her companions, including Joslin Reyes, the mechanic, who is repairing an escape boat, but discovers that Samantha has been abducted by Mathias for a sinister purpose. Pursuing him into the island's ancient temple, Lara discovers that the storms that surround Yamatai are caused by Himiko's vengeful spirit, still trapped in her ancient corpse. Mathias believes if they offer Himiko a ""living successor"", she'll stop the storms and allow them to escape. However, the ritual for the transferal of power involves a trial by fire, which every woman thus far has failed. Samantha miraculously survives the trial, and Mathias takes her into the inner sanctum to continue the ritual. This angers the Guardians, magically preserved but mindless soldiers of Yamatai who defend Himiko's remains. Lara fights her way through both Solarii and Guardians to finally reach Mathias and Samantha in the midst of the transference process. There, Lara finally learns the secret that Mathias knew but she didn't. Namely, that Himiko was a sorceress who cheated death by stealing the bodies of young women as she grew old again and again; the last 'successor to the throne' learned of this ahead of time and poisoned herself during the ritual, so that Himiko's evil soul was trapped in the girl's dead body. Mathias intends to sacrifice Sam to Himiko, giving Himiko the living Sam's body, killing Sam in the process. Therefore, to save her friend, Lara kills Mathias (finally wielding her trademark dual pistols) and torches Himiko's body, sending the witch-queen to Hell once and for all.With the storms finally eliminated, Lara and Samantha escape with what few companions survive (only Reyes and Jonah, the galley master). They are picked up by a passing ship, and given the opportunity to go back home. However, traumatized by her experiences, Lara now believes that she is an adventurer at heart, and there are many more questions that need answering. She has become a survivor, and will go wherever she must to find answers. </div> "

Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the ""collecting videotape"" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from ""T"" to ""E""). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater. </div>  <div> Gameplay Enhancements : While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes. </div>  <div> Levels : Create-A-Skater editor menu.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create a skater, allowing the player to progress through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar or a custom-edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for this character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gapThe ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign. </div>  <div> Characters : The Park Editor's toolsetAlso a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the ""Manuals"" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash CollectablesCash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : HangarLocation: Mullet Falls, MontanaHangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.

Career Mode has been updated (removing the currency system from THPS2) while the PS2 and GC versions support online multiplayer for up to four players.The game was ported to the PlayStation in October 29, 2001 (by Shaba Games), PC in March 28, 2002 (by Gearbox), Nintendo 64 in August 20, 2002 (by Edge of Reality as the last official release for the system), and Mac in January 2003 (by Gearbox). The PS1 and N64 versions run on a slightly-modified version of the engine used in THPS2, changing the levels to fit the memory capacity. Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 15, 2001 (developed by HotGen) and the Game Boy Advance on March 4, 2002 (developed by Vicarious Visions), both of which are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint.Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, this game features crossover characters from different franchises as playable skaters. Darth Maul (a Sith apprentice from the Star Wars franchise), Wolverine (a superhero from the X-Men franchise), and Kelly Slater (a surfer from Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer) are included as hidden unlockable skaters. The PC version of the game features Doom from Quake III: Arena (as Doom Guy).Some of the levels were later released as downloadable content in the 2012 downloadable game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD (for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The revert is a move that allows players to link vert tricks into a new or in-progress combo. It is a flatland trick that is performed immediately when landing off of a vert surface like a quarter-pipe or pool lip. The more times it is used in a single combo, the slower the player's speed will be when exiting the revert. To link vert tricks into a combo, a manual must be performed immediately after the revert animation. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Despite Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 featuring large, open-ended levels, THPS3 used it's current generation of systems' power to its advantage and brought the large-scale environments to life. Areas were now filled with NPCs, moving cars that would stop at obstacles, complex animated objects and real-time level shifting. Every level in THPS3 features a large or minor-scale change that can be triggered through the player's actions and either unlocks a previously hidden area or completely changes a part of the level altogether. These could either be part of a level goal or simply a hidden secret for the player to discover. </div>  <div> Levels : One other major addition to the game was the Trick Modifier system. This is a system that has been with the franchise since, although being refined in THPS4 and perfected in Tony Hawk's Underground. The trick modifier system are ""Hidden moves"" that can be performed by actions on the face buttons. For example, hitting the button combination for a kickflip while hitting the flip trick button twice will perform a Double Kickflip. Hitting it three times will perform a Triple Kickflip. Though THPS3 refers to them as Hidden Moves (An on-screen pop-up appears with a bonus score being awarded), they have become the standard in the series for performing modified versions of standard tricks. </div>  <div> Secrets : A breakthrough addition to the series is the addition of online multiplayer. This would later be refined in later entries of the franchise but the base concept remains the same. The game allows for up to 4 players in one lobby and drops them in a Free Skate session. The host then decides which game type will be played. The various game types can be found below. Players could either play through a Broadband connection or, on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, a dial-up connection. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features a wide variety of game modes thanks to the addition of Network Play. Some new, some returning from past entries. </div> "

Combinations of gates increase a score multiplier. Players rotate their tubes and paddle to increase speed. They gather letters for points (and potentially a free t-shirt), and gather pop cans - which can be thrown at obstacles. Power-ups allow players to carry multiple cans.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game can be played either solo or co-op. Although there is a competitive aspect to the co-op mode in the form of getting more points and pop cans than the opponent. If players dawdle too long, an alligator begins chasing the player, forcing them to either speed up. Lives are represented by patches (as in patches that can be used to repair a tube).The game has three different classes, each with five rivers, for a total of 15. The rivers in each class are as follows:Colorado, Amazon, Okeefenokee, American, and Argentum.Yukon, Styx, Left Bank, Cuprum, and Nile.Jurassic, Black Forest, Rio Grande, Canals Of Mars, and Nightmare.The game's playable characters are Bif and Jet. Whenever there is only one player in the game, there is a computer-controlled opponent called Flotsam.The original arcade version of Toobin' exclusively controlled via buttons; using five of them for each player. Four of the buttons represent hands and direction, such as putting the left hand forward, or the right hand back. This allows for tank-like propulsion and rotation. The fifth button is used for throwing soda cans at obstacles. </div> "

Other than the same name and box art, it is not a direct adaptation of the main game and is instead a direct sequel to the Game Boy Color version of Turok: Rage Wars. Players reprise the role of Joshua as he again thwarts the plants of the Dinosoid legion ""Amaranthine Accordance"" (who is stealing human weaponry for use against the peaceful Dinosoid group known as the ""Solidarity Order""). </div>  <div> Weapons : The game has 23 weapons total (25 if including the deathmatch-exclusive Spear and Claws), with players receiving specific weapons based on their chosen character. In the Campaign Mode, players can upgrade most of their weapons to their character's special counterpart.Unlike Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, all weapons work underwater and no weapons have alternate firing modes (although some have scope) or secondary ammo.Tomahawk (Danielle) / Blade (Joseph) - Standard melee weapon for silent close-ranged kills. Both of them can be upgraded to the Razor Wind: a three-blade chakram that is thrown and returned like a boomerang for slightly longer ranges.Bow - Simple hunting bow for silently launching arrows a long distance. It's distance and trajectory is based on how long the arrow is drawn before firing (by holding down the Fire button, then releasing it). Players can retrieve arrows from enemies killed by it. Danielle can upgrade it to the Tek Bow, which use special explosive arrows. Joseph can replace it with the Storm Bow: a high-tech scoped crossbow that allows players to fire immediately without needing to draw an arrow. It also sports a usable scope.Pistol - Standard mid-range semi-automatic handgun. Danielle can replace it with the Mag 60, which fires in three-round bursts. Joseph can replace it with the Silenced Pistol, which has both a suppressor and laser sight and can be ""zoomed in"" like scoped weapons.Assault Rifle - Standard mid-to-long range assault rifle that fires in three-round bursts. Danielle can replace it with the Firestorm Cannon: a fully-automatic minigun with a very high rate-of-fire. Joseph can replace it with the Sniper Rifle: a single-shot bolt-action rifle with a long-zoom scope.Shotgun - Standard close-to-mid range double-barreled shotgun. Danielle can upgrade it to the Fireswarm, which fires explosive projectiles that can engulf enemies on fire. Joseph can upgrade it to the Shredder, which fires ricocheting projectiles that can stun enemies.Grenade Launcher - Standard grenade launcher that fires explosive ordnance at a trajectory. Danielle can replace it with the RPG: a rocket-propelled grenade launcher that fires explosive ordnance in a completely straight trajectory. Joseph can upgrade it to the Napalm Cannon, which fires explosive ordnance that sticks onto surfaces and is remotely-detonated (by pressing the Fire button a second time).Cerebral Bore - A strange limited-use device that launches spheres (called ""bores"") that home into most enemies, latch onto their heads, drill into their skulls, and deliver a small explosion for a bloody execution. Danielle can upgrade it to the Cerebral Burst, which deliver a larger explosive payload. Joseph can upgrade it to the Cerebral Possessor, which allow players to temporarily take control of their victim (allowing them to be guided towards other enemies for the explosive payload).Vampire Gun - A unique and strange close-ranged device that leeches off of enemies, draining their health and giving it back to the user. Although it uses no ammo, failing to leech off of enemies drains the user's health instead.Personal Singularity Generator - An endgame high-tech super-powered weapon that generates black holes (which absorb nearby enemies, vaporize those inside, and release a powerful explosion). Although it uses no ammo, it has a lengthy recharge time (roughly one minute normally, or 20 seconds with the Unlimited Ammo cheat enabled). Like the Chronoscepter in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and the Nuke in Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the weapon must be fully-assembled before use (with pieces scattered throughout each of the five chapters). </div>  <div> Deathmatch : All players (except the Raptor) spawn with the Spear, along with any weapon set that is set in the options to be given on spawn. By finding weapon pickups scattered throughout each map (and dropped by enemies), players can acquire new sets of weaponry for use. By collecting the same type of pickups, players can pick up ammo for their weapons.Five of the weapon sets include two weapons: the basic version of the weapon and one of the single-player upgrades (which is determined by the character used). Both of these versions share the same ammo pool.Bow (and either the Tek Bow or the Storm Bow)Pistol (and either the Mag 60 or the Silenced Pistol)Assault Rifle (and either the Firestorm Cannon or the Sniper Rifle)Shotgun (and either the Fireswarm or the Shredder)Vampire GunGrenade Launcher (and either the RPG or the Napalm Cannon)Cerebral BorePlayers who use the Raptor start out with their own unique weapon: their Claws. They cannot pick up or use any other weapon set. </div> "

An enhanced Game Boy Color version was released the following year. </div>  <div> Plot : Title screen for Wario Land II on the GBC.One morning while Wario is sleeping in his castle, Captain Syrup and her Black Sugar Gang sneak into his home. The invaders manage to steal all of Wario's treasure he had collected in the first Wario Land game and flood his home by leaving a large water faucet in his basement running. During the raid, the Pirate Gooms accidentally set off Wario's giant alarm clock, but make their escape before he begins stirring. Eventually Wario wakes up and figures out what Syrup and her Gooms have done, setting out to find them. He pursues the Black Sugar Gang across the varied areas outside of his castle in the hopes of having his treasure returned and gaining his revenge against the intruders. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Dungeons! Giant snakes! Giant snakes in dungeons!Wario Land II is noticeably different from the first Wario Land game. Wario is now invulnerable, and is instead susceptible to different transformations from enemy attacks. For instance, if an enemy stomps on Wario's head, he might be flattened, enabling him to cross gaps he might otherwise have fallen through. Of course some enemies are just nuisances and won't help Wario in any way, but regardless an enemy will never cause Wario to die. This change emphasizes puzzle solving and platforming rather than traditional survival.The game has several branching level paths that change how the game's storyline plays out, many of which have their own variation of the game's ending. Once the player has completed one of the endings, they can select any stage they have completed and see which treasures they have and have not collected. In order to see the game's ""true"" ending, the player has to collect every treasure available in the game and complete the entire picture panel that appears after a level is completed. </div>  <div> Stages : Each world, or chapter, consists of five stages and one boss (usually). With only 25 of 50 stages being available with the standard playthrough, searching for hidden level exits adds to the replayability of the game. </div>  <div> Power-ups : The first chapter takes place in Wario's castle and dungeon, kicking out his invaders and doing some damage control. Basic gameplay mechanics are introduced. The very first level also features the most fiendishly hidden secret level exit in the game. </div> "
Wario Land 3,Nintendo R&D1,Nintendo,"April 14, 2000",gbc,3030-16145,Wario Land 3 is a platformer for the Game Boy Color involving Wario's foray into a magical music box on a quest to rescue a mysterious figure and gain treasure.,16145,0,2000-03-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/wario-land-3/3030-16145/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Wario Land 3 is a unique take on the platforming genre. While featuring basic coin collection and platforming elements, the Wario land series puts a twist on the genre by making Wario an indestructible character. While Wario may be invulnerable, he suffers different effects when he is attacked by his enemies. While this may seem to be a disadvantage, the conditions his enemies inflict upon him actually give him new abilities that allow him to overcome the obstacles in his path. Wario must use this asset and his wits to find and collect different colored keys to open color-coded treasure chests. The contents of these chests allow access to new areas, new powerups, or change in previous levels. The difficulty of accessing the various chests combined with Wario's invincibility make the game a very puzzle focused affair. </div>  <div> Story : Wario is cruising along in his plane one day when the engine sputters out and he crashes down to the woods below. He quickly discovers a cave, and heading inside finds a music box on a stand. To Wario's surprise, there appears to be a tiny little world inside the box! As he inspects it closer, the box begins to glow, and Wario is drawn into the world! He finds himself inside a temple, where he is addressed by a large, shadowy figure. The figure tells Wario that it was imprisoned by an evil being, which took it's power away and sealed it inside the temple. Only by finding five magical music boxes and restoring the being to it's former status as ruler of the music box can Wario leave. Of course, he is more motivated by the being's promise of allowing him to keep all the treasure he finds on his way.As it would turn out, the figure was actually the evil Rudy the Clown. After a somewhat short final battle, all the enemies in the game revert to their original form as innocent citizens of Music Box Land. Wario is hailed as a hero as the village elder tells him that Rudy the Clown put the curse on all of the people before he was sealed away, they tryed to stop Wario but they never guessed that he could actually beat Rudy. He is sent back to his world with a massive bag of treasure. He winks at the screen and runs off. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Wario's let himself go recently.Wario Land 3 plays like a typical two-dimensional platformer, with a few twists. Just like he was in the previous game, Wario is completely invincible and cannot die. Often the stages require Wario to alter himself in comical and unique ways to get through a level. Such conditions include lighting Wario on fire, eating an item to make Wario even fatter (it's apparently possible), or inflating him to float through a level. Time of day also factored into the stages, with nighttime bringing zombies or other creatures that could either help or hinder Wario depending on the situation. The various ways in which the levels and Wario himself can be altered mean plenty of backtracking and non-linear gameplay, along with many multi-part puzzles. Wario Land 3's unique presentation was enhanced by colorful character and level design and a catchy soundtrack. </div>  <div> Conditions : Since Wario Land 2 had diverted the series from a Mario spinoff into its own unique platforming series involving invulnerability, this game (And WL2) has instead focused hugely on Wario being afflicted by various coniditons which some enemies or objects can place him under. A detailed explanation of each coniditon is included below: </div>  <div> Golf : Fat Wario is able to bounce off enemy attacks and break blocks underneath him that regular Wario cannot break. This is done by eating a donut thrown at Wario from one of the enemies. </div> "

The Beasts, led by a being known as Chief Zog, have risen up against the humans, led by Queen Azarel. In desperation, Queen Azarel summons the realm's wizards for help. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Resource-management and base/unit building is a major part of gameplay, but the real depth lies in mastering the power of the collectible Wizard units.

Using a Game Link cable two players can engage in a skirmish mode.The game also features two minigames - a version of Poker and a sliding puzzle. </div>  <div> Sequel Cancellation : A sequel, Wizards, was in development for the Game Boy Advance at Bits Studios, but was canceled for unknown reasons before development could be finished. </div> "

Each version was essentially a different game, though they all follow a similar storyline. All three versions star Alleron, a guard captain accused of necromancy. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Warriors of Might and Magic follows a traditional route of Action RPG gaming. Players start in a hostile environment from the start, and are given their first equipment and spell at the start. The game requires caution, and wise use of health potions, as they are the only means of recovering hitpoints.There are of a variety of weapons, shields, armor and items, all with different elemental bases and effects.Combat itself takes place in a real-time fashion, allowing players to dodge, guard and counter-attack as they see fit. With 27 available spells total, Magic also plays a key role in battle, and it may be used for anything from slowing an opponent, to buffering your own strength and defense, to causing a foe to fight for you. From summoning an army of phantoms, to burning your enemy to a crisp, to increasing your speed for a short time. There are many different spells to choose from, and they all have their uses. Like in most RPGs, players gain experience by defeating enemies. Upon leveling up, players may distribute points to their attributes as they see fit. Alleron's stat categories are as follows: Might, Speed, Intelligence, and Endurance.  The Status Screen at level-up.  Might - helps to determine Alleron's total attack rating. Speed -determines Alleron's movement speed and attack speed. Intelligence- determines the effectiveness of spells, as well as Alleron's total mana points. Endurance- determines Alleron's total hitpoints. </div>  <div> Story (Spoilers) : The game opens with Alleron on trial for necromancy. This seems to be a formality, rather than a real trial, as sentence is passed right away. The Inquisitor places a cursed mask called ""The Mask of the Accused"" upon Alleron's face to mark him as a necromancer. The mask seems to take a life of it's own, driving claws into his neck so that it cannot be removed. Alleron is then cast into the Pit of the Accused, and the game starts immediately.Alleron must escape the arena area they have been thrown into, and through a series of prison cells and sewers that are crawling with monsters and undead creatures. From here, it is up to the player to escape the Pit, and reach the outside world. Apok  Along the way, he meets and rescues an orc named Apok from the undead, and Apok in return helps Alleron by giving him a magic ring, and later aiding him in escaping the Orc Mines. This leads him into a ravine, where he meets a talking raven named Carlon that has somehow had his feet magically trapped in a rock. The raven agrees to help Alleron remove his mask, if he will find a potion to dissolve the stone. Alleron meets Carlon the raven.  Following the ravine floor, Alleron finds himself in the orc-populated Village of Draklor, which holds even greater dangers. Draklor, the new orc chief, is preparing to have the old chief killed as per some kind of tradition. The old chief's wife is distraught and asks Alleron to save her husband, which he does. Though grateful, the reunited couple then asks that you recover their food. Draklor has taken all they had to eat in order to celebrate. Alleron once again rises to the occasion and confronts the cruel orc chieftain, managing to slay him. Alleron uses the potion to free Carlon.   The old chief and his wife are extremely grateful and tell him about a way out of the ravine. In a small cave near the top of the cliffs, Alleron finds a potion that can free the raven, and in return, the bird directs him to the Monastery of Enroth. At the monastery, Alleron meets a monk named Saelo, who introduces him to his apprentice, Daria. Though he mentions the quests of Enroth, but insists that he cannot help a known necromancer. As Daria leaves the room, he slyly directs Alleron's attention to a tapestry saying ""For example, I could not direct ones attention to this map, detailing the first Quest of Enroth."" Alleron then makes for the site detailed on the map.  After battling countless gargoyles and golems, Alleron has both the Red and Green Gems of Enroth in his possession. We then see Daria speaking with The Inquisitor, and complaining that Alleron is still alive. The Inquisitor mentions a prophecy and says it forbids her to kill Alleron. Daria retorts that she would never bloody herself, and The Inquisitor assures her that so long as Alleron wears the Mask of the Accused, his mercenaries can kill him, but Daria does not seem convinced. Passing through a magic gate requiring both gems to pass, Alleron finds an ancient tome revealing a startling secret: It has been foretold that only a child of Einar, one of the immortal ancients, could complete the Quests of Enroth. It begins to foreshadow Alleron as the world's guardian, and a son of Einar. The book also states that the children of Einar cannot kill each other. Upon his return to the surface-level of the Monastery, Alleron finds Saelo preparing to leave. He questions the monk, and Saelo replies that he is planning to go to the City of Magic, a dangerous trip to be sure, and that it is there that the magic vial exists that can be used to remove the Mask of the Accused. Alleron offers to go in his stead, leaving Saelo to marvel at his bravery, and to question if he might truly be the ""one"".  After battling his way into the City of Magic, Alleron meets a wizard who aids him in passing through a magical doorway in exchange for finding his rune and scroll. In the next chamber, he finds the potion he was sent for, the one that can finally remove the Mask of the Accused. However, to his surprise he also finds Daria. She blasts the entrance to the chamber, making it impossible for Alleron to return the way he came. She chuckles, telling him he must now travel through the Maze, and the lair of the dreaded Talinthraxus, a dragon who is under her control.  The helpful coyote. Arriving at the maze, Alleron finds his way through with the help of a mysterious coyote. The coyote also leads him to people who have been imprisoned in the walls by dark magics. After fighting through and navigating the maze, Alleron comes face-to-face with the ""Minotaur Twins"" who are to blame for the trapped people (they also guard the exit). Stronger than the dozens of minotaurs he has already faced in the face, Alleron manages to overcome them, and returns to the people to find they are free. He then proceeds to the lair of Talinthraxus, parting ways with the helpful coyote. The mighty dragon proves to be a powerful adversary, but Alleron defeats and slays him, finally escaping the City of Magic. As he arrives at the Monastery of Enroth, it is immediately apparent something is wrong. The entire Monastery has been overrun by the undead! A surviving monk explains that Daria has betrayed them and summoned the undead that are laying siege to the once peaceful place.  Alleron manages to kill all of the undead in the Monastery, and he goes to find Saelo. Saelo then explains that Daria is one of the offspring of Einar, and that she was placed in his care. He had tried to turn her from her ways, but to no avail. Daria had dabbled in witchcraft in its darkest form: necromancy. He explains that everything that has been happening has been according to prophecy and that now, according to prophecy, Daria will attempt to resurrect Daglathor, an evil spirit creature who was sealed away in a volcano by the Ancients.  According to Saelo, it is foretold that only Alleron can stop Daria. He then hands Alleron a potion, commanding him to drink it. As he does, he looks into a mirror, seeming to come to the realization of who he really is, a son of Einar. He then removes the mask, leaving scars in his neck where its claws had dug into him. Saelo tells him to keep the mask, and that it will ""bring him luck"", and then sends him to the Temple of the Depraved. </div> "

They jump around before they explode; they do a maximum of 75 damage.Grenade: The power and length of fuse can be set to ensure maximum damage. Grenades tend to bounce around a lot and are useful for hitting worms hidden in holes.Cluster Bomb: Like the grenade but instead the bomb explodes into smaller cluster bombs which also explode. Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run. Does a maximum of 75 damage.Mine: Places a mine on the ground which will be set off by any worm coming close to it. Can also be placed on top of worms to explode instantly (after a small countdown).Sheep: Lets loose a sheep which bounces along the land and can be exploded at any time.Super Sheep: Much like the normal sheep, however the super sheep can be controlled whilst in the air.Aqua Sheep: The same as the super sheep, except this can go underwater.Mortar: This has a huge range but is very inaccurate.

Useful at creating a quick shelter underground or to flush out worms already below ground.Mail Strike: Drops five letters onto enemies.Mole Squadron: A group of mole bombs dropped from the air, which behave like any other type of strike. However, they can be detonated at will.Blowtorch: Used to dig through the ground to create shelter. Can also be used to attack other worms at close range.

Can also be used to reach inaccessible areas.Baseball Bat: Can knock worms off cliffs and does a maximum of 30 damage.Ninja Rope: A rope that can be used to swing along the landscape and reach inaccessible areas.

Can be used for reaching inaccessible areas.Parachute: Can be used to jump large gaps in the terrain. Weapons can also be dropped while using a parachute. This is heavily affected by the wind.Teleport: Players select a location and then teleport there.Super Banana Bomb: Much like the banana bomb, but more powerful.Holy Hand Grenade: Much like the hand grenade, but does a huge amount of damage and can blow huge holes in the landscape.Flame Thrower: Shoots flames and does a maximum of 125 damage.

Can also be detonated at will before this.Priceless Ming Vase: Places an ancient vase from the Ming Dynasty on the playing field which explodes.Petrol Bomb: Much like napalm, but on a much smaller scale. Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes. Although extremely destructive, it is possible to survive this attack. </div> "

Taking a more complex route than the WCW world tour series. The control scheme mimicked more of a fighting game, rather than a traditional wrestling game. The game required a button sequence to pull off moves. For example: Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver required the following button sequence:Down, Up, Down, or Up, Down, Up (depending on location) + C Left on the Nintendo 64. </div>  <div> Career Mode : Using any wrestler from the roster you compete in 3 title runs, starting from the European title, Intercontinental title, and the WWF title, going through the list of wrestlers in various matches and different situations. After winning the title, you defend the title against the top 5 wrestlers. Also in the career mode, you can do a tag team career mode with a computer character.

Allowing the player to make their own creation, or closely replicate wrestlers not included in the original roster, or from other wrestling organizations. Many fan dedicated CAW sites developed on the internet with formulas for wrestlers, and fictional characters. </div>  <div> Sound : The game received positive response for its sound. The game featured specific crowd chants, commentary from Jerry Lawler, and Shane McMahon, and wrestler voices.

WWF Betrayal,WayForward,THQ,"August 24, 2001",gbc,3030-24982,"WWF Betrayal was released for the Game Boy Color in 2001. Instead of mimicking pro wrestling, it featured WWE Superstars of that era in a side-scrolling beat 'em up.",24982,0,2001-08-07,https://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-betrayal/3030-24982/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : WWF Betrayal marks the first attempt made at bringing the world of the WWF/WWE into video games outside of the pro wrestling genre. An old-school brawler at heart, it was released for the Game Boy Color months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance, and as such did not garner very much attention. To date, only one other attempt has been made at bringing the WWE license to other games with WWE Crush Hour, which is an altogether different genre and bears no relationship to WWF Betrayal aside from the licensing. </div>  <div> Plot : You are the WWF World Heavyweight Champion, and during an ordinary title defence, you lose the Championship to your opponent thanks to outside interference. You head backstage to get a piece of the perpetrators, where you learn that Stephanie McMahon has been kidnapped! To make matters worse, the guys who orchestrated your loss are also the ones who kidnapped Stephanie! Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father and owner of the WWF asks you to save her, and in exchange offers you a rematch for the WWF Championship. Caring not for Stephanie's welfare, you set out anyways in hopes of reclaiming what is rightfully yours: the WWF Championship.Unfortunately, your foes have planned ahead and have stationed guards at every corner just waiting to take you out. What's a WWF Superstar to do? Why, do what he does best: destroy the competition. Chase your targets through the city and beat anything that stands in your way to a pulp, and you just might come out of this with the championship belt around your waist!Due to the nature of the game, the plot was designed to be completely interchangeable so that no matter which wrestler the player selected, the others would still play a part. Thus, the identities of the perpetrators change depending on who you select. The storyline sees significant changes if you select Triple H; since he was married to Stephanie McMahon at the time of the game's release, he would naturally have an actual interest in rescuing Stephanie in addition to reclaiming the WWF Championship.Now choose a WWF Superstar and get ready to rumble! The Rock, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin, Triple H, and the Undertaker are all ready for action. Punch, kick, and use weapons to build momentum and then deliver your finishing move to take out your opponents with style! </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is almost always on the repetitive side in beat-'em-ups, but perhaps more so in WWF Betrayal than others of the genre. The game rewards successive moves with ""momentum"", so the fastest and best way to thrash foes is to punch and kick them repeatedly and use a finisher. Your wrestler also a running dropkick, to be used at your leisure. Discarded weapons can be obtained and used to great effect, but only until you sustain your next hit.Taking a page directly from the WWE's playbook, where no wrestler is ever down and out for long, the traditional life meter ""bottoms out"" early before it empties entirely, dazing your wrestler but allowing him to recover hit points to a manageable level via button mashing. Skilled players can greatly extend the length of each life by watching this meter carefully, which is fortunate since some enemies possess long-range attacks that can drain nearly the entire bar in just a few seconds. Losing a life means you have to start over all the way at the beginning of the level.You will encounter bosses at the end of each level, each one being one of the wrestlers you didn't select, rest assured they are more difficult to defeat than any ordinary baddie. Still, the same set of tricks works on them too, so long as you can outlast them. </div>  <div> Reception : Due to the waning interest in the Game Boy Color at the time of release, the experimental nature of the game, repetitive gameplay and simple character animation, WWF Betrayal failed to garner very much interest and received harsh scores from review publications. </div> "

They must learn to harness their rage and utilize their individual special powers. This was also one of the games that uses the    Thrill Kill game engine. It was released on July 11, 2000. </div>  <div> Story : Mutations have occurred since life began. It was inevitable that eventually, a mutation would result in a being with extraordinary abilities. These are the X-Men: men and women whose actual genetic structure endows them with super-human powers.  Professor Charles Xavier has made it his life's work to train the X-Men to use their powers for good. But still, those born with an ordinary genome hate and fear the X-Men. These unusual warriors learn to project those that reject them. </div>  <div> Modes : Story mode is for one player only. Who you fight against in story mode depends on the current game's difficulty level. With a difficulty level set at 1 (easy), you will only fight against characters in your own group. For example, if you choose to play as  Wolverine, you will only fight other X-Men. If you choose to play as  toad, you will only fight against other evil mutants. When story mode is set to 2 (normal) difficulty, you will first fight all of the other characters in your group and then fight against all the characters in the other group. In this mode  you will be introduced to a new character in the game. When story mode is set to 3 (hard) difficulty, again you will first fight all of the other characters in your group and then fight against all of the other characters in your group. Hard difficulty offers new challenges and will introduce you to the toughest characters in the game. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Vs mode is where you can play head-to-head against a friend. Each of you can choose to play as any of the game's characters. The hidden characters will only be available by inputting their passwords at the title screen. </div> "
X-Men: Wolverine's Rage,Digital Eclipse,Activision,"June 15, 2001",gbc,3030-458,An action-platformer starring the X-Men character Wolverine.,458,0,2001-05-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/x-men-wolverines-rage/3030-458/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The title screen for X-Men: Wolverine's Rage.X-Men: Wolverine's Rage is a side-scrolling action platformer game for the Game Boy Color, developed by Digital Eclipse Software, Inc., and published by Activision. It was released on May 15, 2001 in North America, followed by a European release on June 15, 2001. It was also officially licensed by Marvel, and sponsored by WB' Kids. The sound was designed by Robert Baffy, with additional music provided by Ed Cosico.The game stars Wolverine, the claw-wielding mutant from the popular X-Men franchise, as he embarks on a journey to destroy a super-weapon, referred to as a molecular destabilizer, capable of turning his superhuman adamantium skeleton into molten metal. </div>  <div> Plot : During the opening cutscene, Wolverine is approached by a gang of thugs. After they attack him, and he subsequently defeats them, Professor X contacts him via telepathy to instruct him of Lady Deathstrike's deadly plans to construct a super-weapon. Wolverine must go and stop Lady Deathstrike before it's too late.A cutscene depicting Sabretooth guarding the secret laboratory.X-Men: Wolverine's Rage consists of four separate chapters, with each containing four levels and one final boss fight. The first chapter takes place in New York City, as Wolverine searches the streets for clues. It is here that Wolverine encounters several escaped prisoners and crazed soldiers, as well as other deadly obstacles. After tearing his way through the subway tunnels, he finds Cyber atop a tall building. A fight then ensues, ending with Cyber running off the edge of the roof, and plummeting to his demise. Afterwards, Wolverine searches the nearby shipping crates, and discovers their destination is Tokyo. He continues on to the vibrantly colored city, running along the skyscrapers and even breaking into a dojo. Here he encounters skilled samurais and ninjas. Once Lady Deathstrike is discovered and ultimately defeated, she informs Wolverine that it is too late, as the materials necessary for constructing the super-weapon have already been shipped to a secret laboratory in the Savage Land. Clearly angered by this, Wolverine sets off to the swampy Savage Land, as he battles his way past vicious mutant monsters and wild dogs. Deep in the swamp, Wolverine locates the laboratory, which is being guarded by his nemesis Sabretooth. After a climactic victory over Sabretooth, Wolverine enters the laboratory, and is greeted by deadly robot assassins and grenade-launching robot bombers. Once he carefully maneuvers his way through the perilous laboratory, he approaches Cyber and Sabretooth for one final showdown. After they're both defeated, the laboratory, along with the super-weapon, is suddenly blown up with explosives. The pair set off the bomb in a final attempt to kill Wolverine, who just narrowly escapes the explosion. Wolverine now jokingly wonders how he is going to get home. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A jump-slash, performed by jumping and pressing the attack button mid-air.The gameplay for X-Men: Wolverine's Rage is self-intuitive and quite simple. The goal is to reach the end of each level before the time limit reaches zero. Most of the time, this is no problem. However, to regenerate health, Wolverine must stand completely still, which costs a considerable amount of time. This does not apply to boss fights however, as they have no time limit. There are also extra lives and health-pickups scattered throughout the various levels to help along the way. The level design in this game is quite unique, and a lot of times can be downright confusing figuring out where you're supposed to go. Despite this flaw, the game is not very long, and could easily be finished in one sitting. Upon initially starting the game, the player is given five lives, which when lost triggers a game over. The player must enter a password in order to continue playing after a game over. The passwords are displayed between every other level, and consist of 4 symbols. There are eight symbols in total to choose from.There is also an alternate costume code for Wolverine, which is revealed after completing the game. The alternate costume gives Wolverine a golden appearance, and also provides faster health regeneration. A secret level select code also exists, which when entered allows a player to press the select button during any level to instantly complete it. These secret codes are to be entered on the initial title screen. </div>  <div> Reception : X-Men: Wolverine's Rage received mixed reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 56% from GameRankings. Most critics noted the repetitive nature of the game as being boring and uninspiring. However, some critics offered slight praise to the sound design for being very original and enticing. </div> "

The game's existence first came to light publicly through a listing of Atari's 2011 game release schedule published in early November 2010. The game was officially announced on November 16th, 2010 along with the release of a teaser trailer. The spelling of the new game's title, which shifts ""Yars'"" to ""Yar's,"" is a reflection of the fact that the new game is focused on a single character named Yar, rather than a species known as the Yars. </div>  <div> Plot : Most elements of the original Atari 2600 title's story have been ignored. The protagonist Yar is a member of a race of humanoid insect creatures facing off against the Qotile. Beyond these simple names, the game focuses on its original characters and universe and isn't concerned with maintaining any continuity with the original title. </div>  <div> Graphics : Yar's Revenge features an aesthetic strongly influenced by Japanese animation. The developers specifically cite the works of Hayao Miyazaki and the western film Avatar as the primary inspirations behind the game's art design. Where appropriate, the game also features graphic elements that call back to the design of Yars' Revenge, such as how the appearance of Yar's shield is similar to that of the original game's Neutral Zone. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is an on-rails shooter, similar in style to games such as Sin & Punishment or Rez, that pits Yar against hordes of Qotile-controlled enemies. A combo system allows players to accumulate higher scores by chaining kills and keeping the combo meter filled. Yar's Revenge also features a ""co-op"" mode where two players control the same Yar; one controlling the movement and basic weapons while the other controls the advanced weapons, making it exceedingly difficult to actually do well. </div>  <div> Delisted : As of January 19, 2013, Yar's Revenge was removed from Xbox Live Arcade. Though no official reason was given, it was probably because of publisher Atari filing for bankruptcy.It was eventually relisted (this time with a lower price) and is currently available for purchase. </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : OS: Windows XP SP2, Vista SP2, 7CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E4300 or AMD Athlon X2 4400+Memory: 1 GBHD: 1.5 GBVideo: Radeon ATI Radeon HD 2600 or NVIDIA GeForce 8600, DirectX 9 </div> "
