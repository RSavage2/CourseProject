The game would also see a version for the Super Famicom in 1995 dubbed ""Super Version"" and the computer version of the game would also be adapted for Windows 95 and 98 systems in 2000.

Its setting was also updated to reflect a more modern period. Much of the gameplay design still remains in tact, however, with a mix of puzzle solving and combat performed within a series of fixed camera angles. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each protagonist's gameplay differs in terms of the amount of action and puzzle related gameplay that the player will face with Carnby being the more action-orientated portion of the game and Aline's being more puzzle-orientated. Though the player can chose between either protagonist the stories of each of the characters both occur at the same time and interwoven together. Though there is no major difference in terms of how each character is controlled. </div>  <div> Story : Carnby.A thirty-three year old private eye, Edward Carnby travelled to Shadow Island to discover what exactly happened to his best friend, Charles Fiske, when Fiske was found dead on Shadow Island. As Carnby becomes more involved with the events taking place on Shadow Island, he becomes less interested in his initial goals and concentrates on finding a way off the island and to ensure Aline's safety. </div>  <div> Ports : Aline.A 27 year old Ethnology Professor at Boston University, Aline Cedrac travelled to Shadow Island to help Professor Obed Morton decipher Abkannis writing tablets as well as to search for the identity of her father. </div>  <div> Film : The last Abkannis witchdoctor, Edenshaw came to Shadow Island many years ago and has lived with the Morton family ever since. Edenshaw has watched over the Morton family for many years and has made it his mission to ensure that the gate to the World of Darkness is never opened. Edenshaw acts as an assistant to the player and will appear every now and again to reveal information that may or may not be necessary to the player. He plays a major role towards the end of the game. </div>  <div> System Requirements (PC) : Initially Edward assisted his brother in attempting to open the gate to the World of Darkness and made deals with Christopher Lamb in order to gain 'supplies' that he required in order to make further progress. Edward was revered by many for his work on the Abkannis tribe, though they were unaware of his methods of discovery. After a period of time, Edward realised just how terrible the things he was doing were and turned against his brother, Adam, refusing to assist him. </div>  <div> Availability : Charles Fiske, Edward Carnby's partner and best friend has been reported dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Carnby decides to investigate his best friend's death which leads him to meet with Frederick Johnson, Johnson informs Carnby of three ancient stone tablets that Fiske was searching for. The tablets are believed to unlock some form of incredibly dangerous power.Johnson requests that Carnby should take up Fiske's investigation and to search for the tablets. Carnby accepts that it is his personal priority however, is to find whoever killed Fiske. Johnson introduces Carnby to Aline Cedrac, a young and intelligent university professor. Aline accompanies Carnby to Shadow Island to help recover the tablets as well as to assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes is her long-lost father. As their plane nears the coast of Shadow Island, it comes under attack by a creature of the island, which forces them to parachute out of the plane. They are separated, Aline landing atop the roof of a mansion and Carnby landing in some woods nearby. </div>  <div> External Links : Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color by Pocket Studios and was first released in Europe alongside its console counterparts on May 18, 2001. The port was later released in America on June 25, 2001.When Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color the handheld could not handle the 3D environments of the game, so the 3D was abandoned in favor of 2D sprites. The Game Boy Color received a relatively faithful port of the home console game.

",3030-5570,5570,0,1997-04-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/alundra/3030-5570/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Alundra is a fantasy action adventure with hand-drawn 2D art that blends traditional action adventure elements with more streamlined exploration mechanics akin to those in the Legend of Zelda franchise. Developed by Matrix Software and originally published by SCEI in Japan, It was later released by Working Designs in the US and Psygnosis in Europe. In 2010, the Working Designs version was re-released on the Playstation Network by Monkeypaw Games.Known as ""The Adventures of Alundra"" in Europe, the game is viewed from a top-down perspective where the player takes control of a young boy named Alundra who realizes not long into the story that he has the ability to enter people's dreams and reveal their inner demons. The game is a real-time action adventure where enemies can be engaged where they stand with quick weapon strikes and puzzles must be solved using intelligence, skill and agility as the player attempts to navigate the game's numerous settings and landscapes to further the storyline. These action elements are blended with more traditional RPG components such as strengthening Alundra's attributes over time and collecting an array of skills, weapons, armor, and useful items. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Alundra's gameplay is very much in the same vein as the early Zelda games, a top-down 2D world in which the player can move up, down, forwards and backwards. Alundra will encounter enemies in real-time in the environments, and can attack them on the spot using a variety of weapons including swords, flails, bows and wands. The player will acquire these weapons as they progress through the main story, which is both a lengthy campaign and challenging. Alundra has plentiful puzzles, some of which will require the player to pull off some quick moves, and platforming style challenges. Other puzzles require much more thought and attention. The game is well noted for having some extremely difficult puzzles which will challenge even veterans of similar games. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Alundra's soundtrack consists of one CD and includes 26 songs in all. Some songs from the game were not included in the game due to them being the same song, but using different instruments.

The object of the game is to battle and capture monkeys that have gone rampant. It is also the first game to require the DualShock controller, for it needed the use of both thumb sticks. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The whole point of the game is to stop Specter and his evil monkeys. Spike's mission is to stun the monkeys with any combination of his items, and then capture them with the gadget known as the Time Net. This net captures the monkeys and sends them back to the present. More Gadgets would be given to Spike as the player progresses through the game. The available Gadgets are:Time Net - The only Gadget that can capture monkeys (on land). Swing the right analog stick to swing the net.Stun Club - A lightsaber-like Gadget that stuns monkeys, and also harms various other enemies. Swing the right analog stick to swing the club.Water Net - The only Gadget that can be used underwater. It is automatically switched to when Spike is in water, and can shoot out nets to capture monkeys.Monkey Radar - A radar that is used to find monkeys. The closer Spike is to a monkey, the faster and higher-pitched the sound it emits will be. Once close enough, the camera can zoom in on the monkey and display a little bio. Rotating the right analog stick rotates the radar dish.Slingback Shooter/Slingshot - A slingshot that stuns monkeys. Can also harm enemies and hit buttons. Can shoot 3 different types of pellets: Normal, Guided, or Explosive. Pull back on the right analog stick to aim, and let go to shoot.Super Hoop/Dash Hoop - A hula hoop that gives Spike a speed boost, also allowing him to bowl over enemies. Spin the right analog stick to spin and charge the hoop. Once charged, let go of the stick to activate the boost.Sky Flyer - A little handheld propeller that allows Spike to rise up in the air. Spin the right analog stick to spin the Sky Flyer, and give Spike lift. Continuous spinning will not keep Spike airborne, but it will slow his descent.RC Car - A remote controlled car that can fit through small holes. Used to hit unreachable buttons, or to draw monkeys out of hiding. The right analog stick controls the car.Magic Punch - Obtainable after defeating Specter. An extendable device with what appears to be a boxing glove at the end, it is a powerful Gadget that can destroy boxes and walls that the Stun Club cannot. Tilt the right analog stick slightly for a weak punch, all the way for a strong one.Each of the gadgets has its own training room which must be completed to obtain it. These rooms can also be accessed in the warp room. </div>  <div> Plot : Each monkey has different characteristics and requires different tactics to capture them. For example, some monkeys are sleepy, which allows for an easy capture, while some are energetic, requiring the player to run around after them. Some are aggressive, which means that just running up to them could get Spike furiously punched, and some simply threw banana peels to make him slip. Some even carry firearms. Items have to be used in certain combinations in order to have the monkeys either be backed into a corner or become available to capture. Spike can also try going for a stealth approach. The lights on their helmets signify their statuses:Blue - The monkey is calm. Nothing is amiss.Yellow - The monkey is suspicious and is on alert.Red - The monkey is alerted to Spike, and will attempt to run away and/or fight back.The color of a monkey's pants determines what type of monkey it is. Different strategies are required to catch different monkeys.Yellow - Regular monkey. They can hit Spike, throw bananas to make him slip and sometimes they carry a gun.Red - Strong attacker. They fire rockets at Spike and also carry machine guns.Blue - Fast runner. They run really quickly. The dash hoop/super hoop is used to chase them.White - Great balance. They don't fall over easily.Green - Great vision. They fire rockets at Spike and are vigilant. They also wear 3D glasses.Black - Dangerous and wild. They wear black shades and have machine guns.Light Blue - Timid and gentle. Similar to a yellow monkey but less aggressive. </div>  <div> Controls : There once was a monkey named Specter, who happily performed for humans at the zoo. But one day, the Professor accidentally drops one of his inventions, the Peak Point Helmet (Pipo Helmet). Due to curiosity, Specter tries the helmet on, and gains vast amounts of intelligence, and psychic powers. Now believing that humans treat monkeys cruelly, the megalomaniac Specter vows revenge on humans. He amasses an army of monkeys equipped with similar intelligence-boosting helmets (though less powerful than his own), and storms The Professor's lab. He plans to use the Professor's time machine to go back in time, and make monkeys the dominant species on the planet, instead of humans. Just then, Spike and his friend Jake/Buzz barge into the lab, right before Specter makes the leap back in time. He manages to go back in time anyways, as well as kidnapping Jake/Buzz and turning him into a mind-controlled slave. Aided by the Professor, his assistant/granddaughter Natalie/Katie, and his various gadgets, Spike must now go back in time to save Jake/Buzz, round up the rebellious monkeys, and stop Specter from changing history. </div>  <div> Mini Games : Since the game requires the DualShock controller, it allows for a very unique control scheme (for its time). The character is moved with the left thumb stick, and attacks are done with the right stick. The R button is used to jump. The face buttons allow the character to select from a large variety of weapons, everything ranging from a laser sword to a remote controlled car. Attacks are done by moving the right stick in the desired direction. There are also certain weapons that require the attack stick to be spun around quickly, such as a electric hula hoop that once spun fast enough will shoot the player forward quickly. This control scheme was incredibly innovative at the time and made the game much more immersive because it allowed the player to feel like they were much more involved in using the items in the game. </div>  <div> PSP Port : There are 3 mini games available to unlock in the warp room, each of which is unlocked after collecting a certain amount of Specter Tokens.They all make use of the thumb sticks in unique ways.They are: </div>  <div> Levels :  Spike skiing.A racing game where the characters take to the slopes for a skiing race. There are 5 characters to choose from (Spike, Buzz, Katie, the Professor and Monkey) and it is playable in split-screen for 2 players. The thumb sticks are used to control each of the skis individually. They go faster when lined up correctly and gain additional boost if they are lined up perfectly. 10 Specter coins are required to unlock it. </div> "

It has a strong focus on mech building and customization.",3030-16656,16656,0,1997-10-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/armored-core/3030-16656/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Armored Core is set in a future where a war known as the Great Destruction has devastated Earth and killed the majority of humanity. Due to the uninhabitable conditions of the surface of Earth, the survivors of the Great Destruction were forced into living underground for a period of fifty years. During the fifty year period a number of corporations came to power and the two largest of these corporations were Chrome and Murakumo Millennium who were locked in a constant power struggle, much to the detriment of the rest of humanity. A group of mercenaries known as The Ravens were able to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the power struggle and used it to their advantage. The player takes on the role of a Raven pilot of an armored core, a type of giant mech and acts as a gun for hire for various corporations and groups.Throughout the game the player has a choice of which missions he or she chooses to accept and based on which missions he or she accepts the story will progress differently. Players are also ranked based on their relative success in each mission and can check the results of each mission via their mail. The player can buy interchangeable parts for their armored cores and due to the differing nature of the various situations players are placed in success often relies on building and choosing the right armored cores for the right missions. </div>  <div> Background : Chrome is a megacorporation based out of Isaac City, one of the underground human settlements, and is one of the two corporations that will provide missions for the player. They have a partnership with Chemical-Dyne Co. and exert every inch of power and control that they have over Isaac City. Ultimately, in the end game, Chrome takes desperate measures to maintain control but falls apart, along with its rival Murakumo </div>  <div> Gameplay : Murakumo Millennium is a megacorporation known for the manufacturing of AC parts and technological advances, specifically the Human PLUS Project. They are actively against Chrome‚Äôs exertion of power over Isaac City and see it as their biggest rival. However, Murakumo falls apart as a company, alongside Chrome during the endgame. </div>  <div> Story : The Ravens‚Äô Nest is a mediation group that serves as a sanctuary for Ravens, mercenaries that will take on any mission provided by the warring corporations. The Nest is absolutely neutral in all affairs, not interfering with which job a Raven chooses, and what a Raven is allowed to do, including cooperating with or killing other Ravens. Supplies and repair for ACs are provided by the Nest, as well as messages and contracts forwarded by the Nest‚Äôs sole operator, ‚ÄúR.‚Äù </div>  <div> Parts : The Great Destruction was a catastrophic event in human history that drove mankind underground after thirty years of war left the surface inhospitable. This migration to the underground cities took place 50 years before the events of the game, and now the corporations have succeeded the government in power, and war is raged underground (and above) between Chrome and Murakumo Millenium. </div>  <div> Ranking : Gameplay in Armored Core revolves around customizing your AC and using it during missions provided to you by the Nest. You are provided multiple missions at a time and can choose to accomplish them in whichever order you prefer. While there is a compensation with each mission, for every Armor Point you lose or ammunition you spend during a mission, the pay will be deducted to cover the cost of AC repairs and ammo refills. Using energy weapons instead of solid rounds can reduce the cost needed to restore the AC after a mission. Sometimes a mission can result in the player losing more money than they do earn, and can even go into debt. While in debt, the player cannot buy or sell any parts in the shop until the balance is out of the red.If the player reaches 50000C in debt, the game will play a cutscene from the player's perspective showing that he is about to undergo a Human PLUS procedure. After this cutscene, the game starts from the beginning, but with the player's AC parts and credits carried over as well as a boost in abilities. This can be done multiple times, and for various bonuses, including twice as much energy, the ability to shoot beams from the laser blade with the proper button press, and the ability to use back cannon parts without the need to be stationary. </div> "
Armored Core: Master of Arena,FromSoftware,"FromSoftwareJP, AgetecNA","March 15, 2000",ps,Armored Core Master of Arena is the third installment in the Armored Core series.,3030-16367,16367,0,2000-02-29,https://www.giantbomb.com/armored-core-master-of-arena/3030-16367/,ESRB: T," <div> Background : A research company rising in power and influence, they are responsible for breakthroughs in AC development, and also serve as sponsors for the Ravens' Nest Arena. The company eventually becomes the player's sponsor in the Arena. Within PROGTECH is the head of R&D, Elan Cubis, a brilliant scientist, and contacts the player via mail in later portions of the game. </div>  <div> Story : The main character is a Raven seeking revenge against the number one ranked Raven Hustler One and his AC Nine-Ball. Prior to the game, the Raven's family along with many other civilians were killed in a violent skirmish between Chrome and Murakumo Millenium in Isaac City, with Nine-Ball at the center of the conflict. After encountering Nine-Ball again during the Raven's first mission, his contact Lana Nielsen tells him about the Arena, and that if he wants to defeat Nine-Ball, he must climb to the top of the Arena, but challenging him may result in death.After completing more missions, the Raven is contacted by PROGTECH offering to be his sponsor in the sub arena, and eventually the main Arena. During points in the story, the Raven's Arena licensed is revoked temporarily in order to aid PROGTECH in a critical mission. However, these are mission requests being sent directly to the Raven, rather than through the Nest's channels to the Raven's operator. The Raven receives his first warning from Lana after completing one of these direct mission requests, and after doing it a second time, Lana Nielsen ceases to be his operator, leaving him in the dark without new contracts to accept. The Raven has no choice but to continue fighting in the Arena until he can face Hustler One.PROGTECH continues to face attacks from unknown forces, this time at their head of R&D Elan Cubis. The Raven comes to his aid, and Elan agrees to assist the Raven in anyway he can for information regarding Hustler One and Nine-Ball. Cubis discovers that all important files pertaining to Hustler One and Nine-Ball have been deleted, and sources claim that no one has ever seen Hustler One in person. After reaching 2nd place in the main arena, Elan Cubis goes into hiding for fear of Nine-Ball coming to assassinate him, and Lana Nielsen returns to give one final mission to the Raven. In an abandoned factory in Isaac City, the Raven faces against Nine-Ball, and then two more Nine-Balls at once, all with Lana Nielsen's voice, albeit distorted. Lana Nielsen is revealed to be Hustler One, and that Nine-Ball is controlled by an AI, similar to the first Nine-Ball and ""R"" from the original Armored Core. After destroying the three copies, the Raven descends further into the complex and discovers the ultimate form of Nine-Ball. Nine-Ball Seraph, a more powerful and deadlier version of the red and black AC. The Raven defeats Nine-Ball Seraph, and with the destruction of Hustler-One, the Ravens' Nest functions ceased to operate. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is identical to Armored Core and Armored Core Project Phantasma. With new parts introduced, previous parts were adjusted to better balance the game. Like in Project Phantasma, the player can transfer data from either the original Armored Core or Project Phantasma. Secret parts in the original Armored Core could not be obtained in Project Phantasma, but in Master of Arena, they are available in the shop from the beginning.The Arena concept from Project Phantasma has been expanded, and is now integral to progressing through the main game. The player cannot enter the Arena proper until the player's AC is backed by a sponsor. At points in the game to progress the story, the ability to compete in the Arena will be revoked in order to focus on critical missions for the Raven.Armored Core Master of Arena came with two discs. The first disc contains the mission mode, sub arena, and main arena. On disc 2 was the Ex Arena and Ranker Mk. Ex Arena provided 8 additional Arenas for the players to compete in, and Ranker Mk could let the player create their own custom Arena mode, including AI for the ACs. </div>  <div> Parts : In Armored Core Master of Arena, 27 new parts are introduced, bringing the final total of the PS1 Armored Core parts to 187.

You do much of the same in the game, but the enemies strike little resemblance to those in the comic. The Spider Aliens of the comic book are slightly humanoid, while those found in the game resemble over-sized bugs. You must save Earth from invading enemies, much like in the movie Starship Troopers released a couple of years earlier. </div>  <div> Gameplay : ScreenshotIt's a first-person shooter where each mission is objective-based. There are five environments, both on Earth and in space. Several game segments are on-rails. Player are ranked in a points system and promoted when due. There are two Armorines available for play, one slow and strong and one fast and adequate in strength. Two-player co-op and standard four-player Deathmatch are supported.The game uses Acclaim's Turok 2 engine. By using a Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, the Nintendo 64 version can output in hi-res (640 x 480). The game had no analog support on the PlayStation version, making the control schemes difficult to use.On the GameBoy Color version, you play as a single marine with five weapons to choose from. There are six levels and seven kinds of enemies. </div>  <div> Characters : Gunnery Sergent Harold ""Gunny"" LewisLieutenant Myra Lane </div>  <div> Reception : Although sharing the same engine as the successful Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game did not fare well among videogame critics. IGN wrote that ""Armorines is a Starship Troopers add-on to the Turok 2 engine. Nothing more."" The GameBoy Color version generally received higher scores than the console versions. The Nintendo 64 version generally received higher scores than the PlayStation version; GameSpot wrote that discussing all the bad things about the PlayStation version ""would be like flogging a dead horse"" and that ""elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here.""A sequel for the game was planned, but then cancelled after the game's poor reception. </div>  <div> Prequel Comic : A four issue mini-series was released by Acclaim Comics prior to the games release. Due to low sales, these issues are hard to find, particualarly the final issue (featuring the X-O Manowar). </div> "

The game's tag-line is ""demented action for people who think.""",3030-2710,2710,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/baldies/3030-2710/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The titular Baldies are a short, rotund race of funny little men who, as their namesake suggests, lack any sort of hair producing follicles. The player acts as their disembodied hand-god, guiding hapless Baldies through their normally peaceful daily activities. Not all is well in the land of the Baldies. There is another race, that of the evil Hairies, whose sole purpose in life is to dominate the land and to drive the Baldies into extinction. The goal of the game is to control the Baldies, help them create weapons of war, and ultimately wipe out the Hairy threat. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay in Baldies.Baldies is a real-time strategy game, and as such is often compared to Command & Conquer or Warcraft. This is true to a degree, and the game does share a similar isometric perspective. However, unlike those games, as the hand-god the Baldies the player does not have any direct control over each unit's specific actions or movement. Under normal circumstances, Baldies will wander aimlessly around the game world. In this way, the gameplay is more reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper. Also, there is no traditional fog-of-war.Playing as their hand-god, the player assigns each individual Baldie a specific task that ultimately helps propagate and advance the Baldies' civilization. This is accomplished by using the hand-god powers to literally pluck the Baldies from the earth and then place them in the various rooms of their small shacks. By placing them in a specific room, the specific Baldie will be assigned a new job or task, denoted by a change in the color of his clothes. Red Baldies are workers, which will generate energy that can be used to terraform the land and to unlock the angel wings/flying ability. Blue Baldies function as builders, which can upgrade the starting house or build new houses. Grey Baldies function as soldiers, and white Baldies work as Scientists. The Scientists will create new weapons and technologies for the Baldies, many of which are created by experimenting on the various animals found in the game world. Examples of inventions include bear traps, grenades, and exploding cows. Eventually, even cars and helicopters will be unlocked for use in the war against the Hairies.As mentioned, dropping a Baldie into a specific room of a house changes its role. One room of the house has only a bed in it, and an animated Baldies jumps tirelessly up and down on the mattress. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is the room that must be occupied for more Baldies to be bred. This is an important function, as the player will need numerous Baldies of all kinds in order to overrun the enemy race. This is the main mechanic of the game - constantly shifting the roles of the Baldies so as to most efficiently reproduce, advance technologically, and ultimately destroy the opposition.In addition to the ability to physically move Baldies, the player can also wield some limited god-like powers. The Flamehead attack allows the player to call down the heavenly fire to smite a specific unit. The player also have the power to bring about Armageddon, which will instantly change every Baldie under the player's control into a solider and transport them to a small island with every unit of the opposing faction. The last Baldie or Hairy standing wins! </div> "

The winner of each Relics exploration is determined by who gets the highest points total. Players will automatically sell the target item to the broker who hired them, but can choose to keep or sell other items they've found. </div> "

Many aspects of Beyond the Beyond later found their way into Golden Sun, such as three characters parties and active time battle. While the game did receive poor reception, it has garnered a small cult following. </div>  <div> Story :  ¬†Steiner, one of many playable characters     Beyond the Beyond is the story of a young apprentice knight, Finn, who is caught up in an ancient war between the Beings of Light and the Warlocks of the Underworld. With the peace of the island he calls home in jeopardy, he embarks on a quest to end this battle once and for all. Finn and a number of other adventurers are tasked with defeating enemies from the underworld to protect the fate of the kingdom of Marion.¬† </div>  <div> Gameplay :    Finn - The default player character.¬† The name can be edited by the player.¬† Finn is¬†an apprentice Knight raised by Annie's family.¬†   Annie - The healer, daughter of Galahad.Percy - Annie's older brother and knight.¬† Samson - Cursed soldier, the tank character. ¬† Edward - Prince and the party's magic user.¬† Tont - Summoner.¬†¬† Lorele - Princess of Barbaros, a monk. ¬† ¬†¬†  Steiner - Baby dragon and Finn's best friend.¬† </div>  <div> Soundtrack  :  ¬†In the overworld, players can interact with the environment and non-playable characters     The game is split between two sections; the overworld and the battle scenes. The overworld consists of traditional role-playing game mechanics, whereas the player explores a two-dimensional world in a top-down perspective. Here, the player explores towns and villages, talks to non-playable characters, continues the storyline, completes side-quests, and triggers random encounters. Additionally, there are three secret characters which can be unlocked, although the game was almost universally panned for a general lack in length and depth beyond these features.The battle system differs from other role-playing games of the time, and has many similarities to Camelot's later Game Boy Advance title Golden Sun. When a battle is triggered, the view switches to beyond-the-back. Despite this, the change is not only cosmetic. Titled the ""Active Playing System"" players interact with the battle by pressing certain buttons at the correct moment to greatly increase the chances of landing a more powerful attack.¬† ¬† ¬†The Active Playing System was a feature for which the game was heavily criticized     While most role-playing games use a               Hit Point (HP) system to determine if a character is alive or dead/unconscious, Beyond the Beyond essentially divides this stat into Vitality Points (VP) and Life Points (LP). A character has more VP than LP and when a character's VP reaches zero and they still have LP, the character will become 'groggy' for the remainder of the round and unable to act. However, at the start of the next round a portion of LP will be consumed to recover a small amount of VP and allow the character to take actions again. If a character reaches zero VP and does not have any LP remaining, the character will die and must be revived. It is also important to note that healing items and spells only affect VP.¬†¬† Upon defeating all enemies in a battle, players are granted with experience points and money. The money serves its purpose for buying items in the overworld, although the leveling system is different than other role playing games. After reaching level twenty, that character can be promoted. This causes the character's level to be reset to one, although they gain the ability to use better armor and weapons. Another portion that the game was criticized for was the fact that once the player died, they were sent back to their last save point with only Finn alive, and half of the money gone.  </div>  <div> Other Details  :  ¬†Beyond the Beyond: Original Game Soundtrack     Despite being the most well-received portion of the game, Beyond the Beyond's soundtrack still did receive some criticism for the fact that it relied on MIDI format songs rather than pre-recorded red book audio. The game's soundtrack was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, and five tracks were later released by Antinos Records on May 2, 1996. This version was a heavily arranged version of the soundtrack, with five long tracks, despite being advertised as an original game soundtrack. This soundtrack has received moderate acclaim, despite its rarity (copies of the soundtrack go for over $100 USD). ¬† </div> "

These power-ups are designed to help you reach previously unreachable areas and progress in the game.Sophia J-7 also becomes slowly equiped with 4 different types of sub weapons; these include the Blaster, which is a powerful direct cannon shot; Homing, which are homing missiles; Thunder, which is a powerful electricty cannon and finally the Field Guard which errects a damaging force field which both attacks and defends. The supply of these are limited so power-ups will have to be found to refil the gauges or if special icons are found perminately extend the limit of a specific sub-weapon by one bar.As Roddy you explore smaller underground base-like areas where power sources, usually to electric gates hindering Sophia's progress are found. Roddy has two main attacks a standard gun (which can be powered up to a powerful flame-thrower) and a napalm grenade. He also has the use of move called HyperSonic which allows him to dash around at high speed to damage all nearby enemies he comes in to contact with.The world is centered around a main hub, which contains portals to the four different game zones: the Cavern, Stream, Volcano and Jungle. Each of these areas needs to be explored a couple of times, later with some of the new power-ups you will have gained. These zones are the game's ""levels"" and is where most of your fighting will be done. </div> "

Captain Blasto utilizes his trusty blaster to vaporize various aliens and robots. Levels are completed by rescuing Babes that have been held captive. Babes are  rescued by  solving relatively easy  puzzles that usually involve fighting a few  enemies  and flipping a switch. ¬†¬†¬†The game breaks off into 13 episodes as followed ( see list below) and as the game progresses the puzzles, and monsters get harder, so its not a walk in the park.

She tricks Kain into thinking that getting rid of all the Pillar Guardians and cleansing the land will cure his condition.During his quest, Kain comes across the reclusive Vorador, one of the oldest vampires in the land. He tries to guide Kain by telling him how he needs to embrace his vampiric gift and stay out of human affairs. The arrogant Kain refuses to listen and continues to go about getting rid of all the Pillar guardians. He comes across Moebius, posing as an Oracle, who warns him about the impending invasion of Nosgoth and the threat posed by the Nemesis ‚Äì a king formerly known as William the Just. Moebius also informs him that the only way to kill anyone in the Circle of Nine is by first getting rid of Malek, the undead paladin. Kain uses Vorador to deal with Malek and kills three Pillar Guardians in the garden of Dark Eden.Kain's mission next leads him to Avernus Cathedral, where he finds the Soul Reaver, the Wraith Armor, and a time-streaming device. Kain tries to help King Ottmar's armies against the forces of the Nemesis, but ultimately fails as the old King is slayed. Using the time-streaming device he found in the Cathedral's catacombs, he travels 50 years into the past and comes across a young King William, who is also wielding the Soul Reaver. The presence of two Reavers in the same space/time creates a paradox which changes the course of history. Persuaded by Moebius's words, Kain murders the young king. On returning to his own timeline, Kain finds out that he has been betrayed by Moebius, and that his assassination of William the Just was used as a catalyst to ignite a genocidal crusade against the vampires. After Vorador's execution, Kain is the last vampire left in Nosgoth. Moebius sets a mob on Kain but the vampire escapes. Infuriated by Moebius's trickery and betrayal, Kain chases the timestreamer down and gets his revenge for beheading the sorcerer. As he returns to the Pillars, he finds Mortanius in argument with Anarcrothe, the last two Pillar Guardians.A brief battle commences where Mortanius turns into a dark entity and defeats Anarcrothe. Kain then confronts this demonic figure and tells him how he must die too to bring balance to Nosgoth. This ‚ÄúUnspoken‚Äù informs Kain how this had been the plan all along and that Kain played the role of his tragic hero. He also reveals that Kain is the Guardian of the Balance Pillar and that he too must die if balance is to be restored. After Kain defeats the dark entity, he is given a choice - to sacrifice himself and end the vampire race to save Nosgoth or refuse the sacrifice and rule a corrupting empire as its king. All the later games in the series are based on the assumption that Kain refused the sacrifice. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Kain at the PillarsThe gameplay in Blood Omen involves a lot of puzzle solving and there are many sections which test players' dexterity. The player has a top-down view of Kain and his surrounding world. Kain acquires a new power on killing any Pillar Guardian, thus adding a hint of RPG element to the gameplay. He can disguise himself to speak to common villagers and gather valuable information. A key mechanic, which would be used in all the later games as well, is Kain's blood thirst. His health goes down slowly over time and he must continuously feed on human blood to satisfy this hunger. Kain also has the ability to phase shift and turn into a wolf. He will weaken in the sunlight and his health will drain more quickly in the rain. He can jump across great distances in his lupine form. Kain has various armors and weapons at his disposal. Throughout the game, he collects valuable relics from various landmarks in Nosgoth, most significant of which is The Soul Reaver.Kain's blood meter also represents his health, but he has a magic meter as well, representing the power of his soul. This meter fuels the myriad of magic attacks Kain has at his disposal, as well as allowing the mighty Soul Reaver to instantly kill normal enemies as long as there is appropriate energy remaining. Stronger enemies require more magic to instantly kill. He will also collect cards that represent items which can be used as weapons whose effects vary based on the card; or a health boost in the case of the Heart of Darkness.If Kain comes across humans chained to a wall, he can feed on them at will, otherwise he must incapacitate them first, at which point they'll begin to pitch and reel and Kain can either feed on them or kill them outright. Humans chained to walls don't respond per se, but their ghosts reappear if Kain returns to the room they were in. As with other specters, feeding on ghosts will replenish Kain's magic gauge. There are also demons whose black or green blood is deadly poison to Kain and if he feeds on them rather than executing them, his blood meter will decrease. </div>  <div> Characters : Kain: A haughty nobleman from Coorhagen, Kain ventured into a bar for a drink and to get out of the cold. When he emerged, no drink or room having been acquired, he was set upon by brigands who proceeded to murder him. Tormented by his thirst for vengeance in Hell, he is approached by the necromancer Mortanius, who offers him a chance at a new life and thus revenge. Kain takes the offer and is resurrected as a vampire.Ariel: The former Guardian of Balance, now only a tortured spirit, Ariel sets Kain on the path to kill the Circle of Nine and cleanse Nosgoth, convincing him this will rid him of his curse. She was murdered by Mortanius who was, at the time, possessed by the demonic Unspoken. The murder drove her lover, Nupraptor mad, thus leading to the corruption of the Pillars of Balance as his madness infected the other Circle of Nine.Nuprapator the Mentalist: The Guardian of the Pillar of the Mind was driven mad when his lover was assassinated. This caused his pillar to be corrupted, which caused the other guardians to go mad, also corrupting their pillars.Vorador: An ancient vampire, advanced in his mutation, Vorador recognized the corruption of the Circle of Nine and killed them all while Malak was waging his crusade against vampires. Vorador promises to help Kain should the neophyte vampire every have need, and the need, of course, comes up when Kain confronts the ghost of Malek. Vorador is summoned to defeat the paladin as he did before, and he succeeds. Vorador, however, meets his fate after Kain changes time by killing William the Just.Bane the Druid: The guardian of the Pillar of Nature, Bane immersed himself in his element, dressing in animals skins, wearing a deer's head and having control over nature. He was one of the three founders of the twisted Dark Eden, using his mastery over plants to create the strange plant-life.DeJoule the Energist: Guardian of the Pillar of Energy, DeJoule could absorb and project energy in any way she wished. She helped Bane and Anarcrothe found the twisted country of Dark Eden, using her power over energy to give life to the twisted inhabitants.Anarcrothe the Alchemist: A powerful scientist who dabbled in forces he didn't fully understand. He was driven to madness along with the other pillars members and founded Dark Eden as a place of twisted perversions of nature with the help of Bane and DeJoule. Anarcrothe's face was hideously disfigured in an unnamed experiment that ended poorly for him. His pillar was the Pillar of States (as in ""of being"" not governmental bodies).Moebius the Timestreamer: Originally the Oracle of Nosgoth, Moebius' motivations are dubious at best, but he at first helps Kain find a way to defeat Malek. He later reveals himself to the Guardian of the Pillar of Time and also able to manipulate the timestream with his device (the Timestreamer), which Kain eventually acquires and uses to attempt to prevent William the Just from becoming The Nemesis.Malek the Paladin: The guardian of the Circle of Nine, as well as the Pillar of Conflict, Malek is defeated by Vorador after the vampire lord kills six of the Circle of Nine. For this failure, Mortanius strips him of his mortal flesh and confines his soul to his armor, thus leaving him only one purpose: serving the Circle for eternity. Kain encounters him after finding a way through his bastion but finds he cannot defeat the mighty warrior. It would be at the second encounter, after the Paladin was summoned to protect the creators of Dark Eden, that Kain would summon Vorador to defeat Malek.Mortanius: Kain's mysterious benefactor and Guardian of the Pillar of Death, Mortanius has been unwillingly possessed by the Unspoken and was forced to set the events leading the Circle to madness in motion by murdering Ariel. He gives Kain new life so that he can kill the Circle of Nine and cleanse the land of corruption.William the Just: Originally a benevolent leader, William became corrupt after possessing the Soul Reaver and christened himself The Nemesis. He led his hordes against the land of Nosgoth, with the only army able to stand against him the legions of Willemby led by good King Ottmar. Kain travels back in time after the battle between the two armies to kill William before his corruption. This act has horrible, unforeseen consequences, however and Kain is forced to deal with a world much more hostile than the one he left behind.King Ottmar: The only hope of Nosgoth to defeat the Nemesis, King Ottmar is at first paralyzed with grief due to his daughter's illness brought about by Elzevir the Dollmaker's curse. He is roused after Kain breaks the curse and takes to the battlefield against the Nemesis. Something goes horrible wrong, though, and Kain is forced back in time to attempt to rectify the problem at its source.Elzevir the Doll-maker: King Ottmar announces a doll-making competition to celebrate his daughter's birthday, and Elzevir makes the finest one. However, the doll has a sinister use: it steals the poor girl's soul and allows Elzevir to possess it. Kain goes to the doll-maker's hut and hunts him down. Elzevir dies, wailing that he only wanted the princess' love.The Unspoken: A massive demon responsible for Nosgoth's current state, The Unspoken (as called by Ariel) resides in Mortanius, coming out only at the end of the game for Kain to battle to the death as his final obstacle. </div>  <div> Weapons : Kain will come across numerous weapons in his quest for vengeance, something that separated the game from it's contemporary puzzle RPGs with only a few weapons throughout the game.Iron Sword: Kain's starting weapon, and as expected not a very powerful one. The steel sword offers neither benefit nor hindrance and so is useful in situations where it's unknown how enemies will respond to certain weapons.Spiked Mace: This weapon will allow Kain to stun human foes in two hits (including the towering hulks of the Nemesis' army), thus leaving them vulnerable to feeding. The downside is it has incredibly low attack and thus is useless against anything but human opponents. The mace can also break open ""breakable"" objects in the environment, such as stones and chests.The Axes: Called Havoc and Malice, Kain wields the twin hatchets that he can use to attack rapidly, and if he continues to attack will begin to whirl around, damaging all the enemies surrounding him. However, the blades are two handed weapons, which prevents Kain from casting spells or using items while he has them equipped. He can also use them to chop down trees blocking his path.Flame Sword: This sword has high attack and will set foes ablaze. Kain can use his standard combo that he uses with his Steel Sword, thus making the weapon incredibly powerful. It is of course useless against enemies with fire resistance, but more importantly the foes are burned away, thus depriving Kain of feeding. It's best use is when Kain's blood meter already high, or against bosses who can't be drained anyway.Soul Reaver: The massive blade screams as it slashes through entire ranks of enemies and even bosses. So long as Kain has magical energy, the Reaver will plow through entire hordes of normal foes and deal out massive damage to bosses, but the moment that meter is emptied, it becomes as powerful as the iron sword. The Soul Reaver is a two handed weapon and subject to the same limitations as the axes. </div>  <div> Armor : Every great vampire warrior out for revenge needs protection against those that would stop him. In Kain's case he has a veritable wardrobe of armors to choose from.Iron Armor: The armor Kain was killed and resurrected in, the iron armor offers decent all around protection, and a slight bit of fire resistance.Bone Armor: Weak undead units, such as wandering zombies and skeletons, will mistake Kain for one of their own when he wears this armor, thus allowing him safe passage.Chaos Amor: More powerful defensively than the Iron Armor with the added bonus of inflicting any enemy that struck Kain with the same amount of damage. This could even be used to stun them without Kain actively attacking.Flesh Armor: The flesh armor will drain blood from enemies with every strike completely automatically, however one must use caution as it will also drain the poisoned blood of demons automatically. It also has lower defense than the iron or Chaos armors.Wraith Armor: This armor has an interesting effect: it spreads any damage Kain recieves evenly through his blood and magic meters, thus allowing him to take more damage overall, but also decreasing his ability to shift forms or cast spells. </div>  <div> Spells : Kain will acquire spells as he goes through his quest. Some are essential to continue with the game, and some are strictly optional. All of them consume at least some of his magic meter with the exception of Sanctuary.Sanctuary: Casting this spell enables Kain to instantly teleport back to his mausoleum, where he'll be completely restored, but he will have to battle his way back to wherever he was at the time of using the spell.Light: As suggested, this spell merely illuminates an area, allowing greater visibility.Energy Bolt: Kain hurls a bolt of chaotic energy that can be used to either damage enemies or flip switches across impassable hazards.Repel: Casting this spell puts up an impenetrable barrier around Kain, keeping him safe from any form of damage for a very short time. It's short duration and high cost make it extremely impractical for regular use.Inspire Hate: This spell will turn all enemies in the area against one another unless Kain approaches too close or attacks them.Stun: Using this spell on human foes will cause them to be stunned and easy pickings for feeding. It has no effect on non-human enemies.Incapacitate: This spell creates a homing projectile that will go straight to the nearest enemy and freeze them in place for a few seconds. It can be used on any type of normal enemy.Blood Gout: Using his own blood as a fuel source, this spell sends out a projectile that, upon striking an enemy, causes blood to flow back into Kain, thus replenishing him.Mind Control: Kain displaces a human enemy's soul from its body, enabling him to take control and manipulate it in any way he sees fit. His own body is protected by a shield for the duration and the enemy will die after Kain releases his hold on it. This spell only affects humans.Blood Shower: Kain would draw blood from any four enemies onscreen at once upon casting this spell. Any other enemies in the area still die, and the spell will also draw poisonous blood out.Spirit Death: This spell causes the victim's soul to immediately be torn from the body, thus killing any enemy (save bosses) instantly.Spirit Wrack: Similar to Mind Control, this spell will affect any normal enemy instead of just humans.Lightning: Only usable outdoors, the lightning spell would hurl down destructive bolts upon all normal enemies in the area, killing them all instantly and spectacularly. </div>  <div> Items : These are miscellaneous items that can be found in the world or at special Spirit Forges. Kain can carry 99 of any one item.The Heart of Darkness: Supposedly torn from the chest of Janos Audren, the greatest vampire ever to live, the Heart of Darkness will either refill Kain's health greatly if used manually. If Kain is struck down and possesses at least one, it will be automatically consumed and he will be revived with some health.Flay: These small, sharp discs will home in on enemies and cause them damage, eventually leaving nothing but a red skeleton.Implode: Much more powerful than Flay, these items lack homing capacity, but they will instantly and horrifically kill most normal enemies on contact.Slow Time: All enemies in the area move at a quarter of their normal speed for a brief time.Font of Putrescence: Another homing item, but this one reduces a single enemy into a pool of toxic sludge. Any enemy, or Kain himself, caught in the pool will take damage.Pentalich of Tarot: One of five horrific deaths will be visited upon every normal enemy in Kain's vicinity upon using this powerful item.Anti-Toxins: If Kain should become poisoned, by either enemy attack or consumption of green blood, this will cure him instantly.Energy Bank: This item will make Kain's magic reserves limitless for a brief time. After it expires, Kain's magic meter will be completely drained and have to recharge on its own. </div> "
Bloody Roar,SCEA,8ing/Raizing,"January 2, 1998",ps,"Bloody Roar is best known for its ""zoanthrope"" system, where each playable fighter has the ability to transform into a half-human half-animal creature with enhanced fighting abilities.",3030-19738,19738,0,1997-07-07,https://www.giantbomb.com/bloody-roar/3030-19738/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Each martial artist has their own half-beast alter-ego.Beastorizer (known in Japan and Europe as Bloody Roar: Hyper Beast Duel with the PlayStation release being titled Bloody Roar) is a 3D fighting game developed and released by Eighting/Raizing (in conjunction with Hudson) for arcades on July 7, 1997. It is the first of the Bloody Roar series.Similar to other 3D fighting games at the time, Beastorizer is unique as players fight as one of eight ""zoanthropes"", warriors who can transform into powerful animal-human hybrids (similar to werewolves) to gain a temporary edge in battle. The common theme of the story involves Tylon Co., a multinational corporation that seeks to brainwash zoanthropes for a sinister purpose.The game is better known for its Sony PlayStation port, developed by Hudson and published by SCEA in North America on October 31, 1997 (as Bloody Roar), by Hudson in Japan on October 31, 1997, and by Virgin in Europe on March 1998. This version is known for its numerous unlockable gameplay options (includng the ability to side-step and become super-deformed). This version was digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on August 20, 2009. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The main attraction of Bloody Roar was the ability to activate the Zoanthrope's transformation abilities and become an anthropomorphic animal of some form. To transform, the player had to fill up their beast-gauge, located underneath the health bar. The beast-gauge would fill up slowly over time, however, it could be filled faster by successfully damaging the opponent. Taking damage from an opponent or hitting a guarded opponent would also increase the beast-gauge, only less so than hitting and damaging the opponent.The beast-gage had two stages; the blue stage and the flashing multicoloured stage. The player could only transform when the multicoloured gauge was active. To get to the multicoloured stage the blue gauge first had to be filled. When the blue beast-gauge was full it'd then be replaced by the multicoloured beast-gauge and the player could then transform any time, no matter how full the multicoloured gauge was. Filling the multicoloured gauge did have its advantages, though:The Zoanthrope could remain transformed for longer as the Beast-gauge is depleted through received damage, and once fully depleted the player would revert to human form.Some of the damage that would be taken out of the health is instead taken out of the beast-gage, so having a fuller beast-gauge would effectively increase the player's health.Rave mode [a mode accessible after transforming] and its duration were directly linked to how full the beast-gauge was.The advantages of transforming were more than just aesthetic, the player's character would be harder hitting, gain extra attacking moves via the circle button, access to Rave mode, and would increase in weight. Also, worth noting is that upon transformation a player would regain some health over-time. The health bar was split into three colors; dark blue is the health that has been depleted that round, light blue represents where your health will recover to [over-time] after transforming, and yellow is the actual remaining health.Rave mode, mentioned earlier, was a boost on top of the transformed shape that would increased the player's speed. The player's speed increase was an all-round speed increase - meaning not only did the player move faster, but also their animations and recovery times between attack-combos were faster. Rave mode drew its power from the beast-gauge and would deplete the gauge over-time. After it is fully emptied the Zoanthrope would remain transformed but would be one hit away from reverting to human form. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes eight playable characters and one unplayable boss, all of whom can transform into their own Beast:Yugo (Wolf)Alice (Rabbit)Gado (Lion)Long (Tiger)Bakuryu (Mole)Fox (Fox)Mitsuko (Boar)Greg (Gorilla)Uriko (Chimera, unplayable boss) </div> "

The story takes place years after the original, where a new terrorist organization (the Zoanthrope Liberation Front, or ZLF) seeks complete dominance over humans and opposing Zoanthropes.Like its predecessor, it's better known for its Sony PlayStation port, developed by Hudson and published by Hudson in Japan on January 28, 1999, SCEA in North America on April 30, 1999 (as Bloody Roar II, also known as Bloody Roar II: The New Breed), and Virgin in Europe on July 1999. This version was digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on June 8, 2010. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is primarily based on taking advantage of the beast form which make fighters stronger, faster and feature special moves. To regulate a fighters beast form there is a power bar placed in the corner for each player. Players are always given the power to transform at the start of a match however when the bar is blue the character can only fight as a human. Taking and giving damage, both build the blue bar till it begins a yellow bar that overlapping the blue bar. With just a sliver of yellow in their power bar, fighters can transform into their beast form. However the yellow bar indicates how much damage the beast form can take before it depletes and reverts the character to their human form. So player would prefer to build this yellow gauge before transforming. The yellow bar does not increase while supporting the beast form. Building up the yellow bar without taking too much damage is the balance players consider as they compete.Replacing ""Rave"" mode from the first game, player can now perform a super move combo by hitting the L1 button while in beast mode. The move strikes multiple devastating consecutive hits. These  Super move combos are flashy and showy performances that add a lot of flair to a match despite how experience the players are. They can miss or be defended against. These moves deplete the casters beast gauge. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes nine playable fighters from the start and two unlockable boss fighters. </div> "

It stars the titular Musashi, a young warrior loosely based on the legendary Japanese swordsman of the same name, who has been magically summoned to defend the peaceful Allucaneet Kingdom from invasion by the ruthless Thirstquencher Empire.The game is notable for its real-time combat, fully polygonal 3D environments and extensive voice-acted dialogue; these features were a significant departure from Square's previous entries in the role-playing genre. The North American version of Brave Fencer Musashi also included a separate disc containing a playable demo of Final Fantasy VIII.Brave Fencer Musashi was released as a PSone Classics title on Japan's PSN in 2008. </div>  <div> Story : MusashiOver one hundred fifty years ago, a gigantic monster suddenly appeared in the nation of Thirstquencher, which neighbors the Allucaneet Kingdom. This creature was known as the Wizard of Darkness, an evil being composed almost entirely of a crystalline substance with potent magical properties called Binchotite. After easily destroying Thirstquencher, the monster began moving towards Allucaneet, seeking the bountiful supply of Binchotite buried beneath the kingdom.Upon receiving news of the Wizard of Darkness' approach, King Allucaneet ordered the immediate casting of the ""Hero Summon"" spell. This powerful magic spell is a closely guarded royal secret handed down between generations of Allucaneet's princesses, only to be used as a last resort in times of great crisis. It grants its user the ability to summon a hero using incantations made over a specially prepared Binchotite crystal. The hero summoned to defeat the Wizard of Darkness was a dual-wielding swordsman named Musashi, who accepted the princess' task and set out on a journey to save the kingdom.Even for a skilled warrior like Musashi, the Wizard of Darkness proved a formidable foe. After a lengthy and difficult battle, Musashi used Lumina, the ""Sword of Luminescence"" to seal away the creature within a magical ward. He then divided the monster's power into the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Wind and Sky, sealing them within five crests. These crests became known as the ""Five Scrolls,"" and in the years that followed, they passed into myth along with the legend of the heroic ""Brave Fencer Musashi"".Now the peaceful kingdom of Allucaneet has suddenly come under attack from the Thirstquencher Empire, a brutal dictatorship under the rule of F√ºhrer Flatski. Several years prior, Flatski and his minions usurped the throne from its rightful rulers before transforming the once-peaceful Thirstquencher into a warmongering Empire fueled by the power of Binchotite. Unfortunately the king and queen of Allucaneet are travelling at the time of Thirstquencher's attack, as if the Empire timed its invasion to coincide with their absence. The invasion begins with one specific goal: to capture the sword Lumina, which still remains within Allucaneet's borders. According to the Musashi legend, Lumina grants extraordinary powers to the one who wields it along with the Five Scrolls.Unable to repel the surprise attack, Allucaneet's defenders quickly lose ground as the enemy army presses on towards the royal palace. With Thirstquencher's forces at their doorstep, the senior regents of Allucaneet realize that their only hope lies in summoning a hero. Princess Fillet performs the incantations with a giant Binchotite crystal in the palace basement and summons a young boy who claims to be Musashi. However, he shows little interest in Allucaneet's plight until being told that he will be unable to return home until his heroic task is completed. Musashi reluctantly accepts Fillet's request to retrieve Lumina from nearby Spiral Tower, recover each of the Five Scrolls and save the kingdom from Thirstquencher's army. </div>  <div> Gameplay : At its core, Brave Fencer Musashi is a single-player action RPG; Musashi's ultimate goal is to obtain each of the Five Scrolls, which will imbue his magical sword Lumina with the power needed to defeat Thirstquencher Empire's forces and liberate the citizens of the Allucaneet Kingdom. Along the way, Musashi interacts with several of Allucaneet Palace's NPC residents who provide additional support, as well as the townsfolk of nearby Grillin' Village.The game's characters and environments are rendered in full polygonal 3D, and the majority of Brave Fencer's areas are presented from a third-person perspective using a variety of pre-determined camera angles; however, the player is given limited camera control in certain sections. By defeating enemies over the course of the game, Musashi can gain experience points and level up to increase his base attributes. Players can also collect a variety of helpful items and earn currency called ""Drans"" that can be spent on goods found in several shops located in Grillin' Village.Players begin the game equipped with Fusion, a sleek katana capable of fast combo strikes. Fusion can be charged and thrown at foes in order to ""Assimilate"" Musashi's enemies and gain temporary use of their unique abilities. All Assimilated abilities require ""Bincho Power"" (or BP) for Musashi to activate.Like his namesake, Musashi practices a dual-wielding sword technique and also carries the broadsword Lumina on his back once it has been acquired in Chapter 1. Lumina is much heavier than Fusion and is used for slower, more powerful strikes against enemies and bosses' weak points; it can even be charged like Fusion to perform a spin attack. Lumina is also used to rescue Allucaneet Palace's kidnapped residents from crystalline prisons called ""Bincho Fields"". Once freed, the palace residents may provide additional support for Musashi during his quest, such as teaching the player new combat techniques or crafting special items. Musashi absorbs the energy from these shattered Bincho Fields, which increases his maximum BP.Lumina's power can be further increased by obtaining each of the Five Scrolls scattered throughout the world. Each Scroll augments Lumina with a powerful elemental spell that can be used both in combat and to overcome certain obstacles. Several pieces of ""Legendary Armor"" are also located in specific areas, which grant Musashi special abilities such as double-jumping or an increased critical hit rate; however, these artifacts must be appraised before they can be equipped. </div>  <div> Locations : Brave Fencer Musashi features a day/night cycle driven by a simulated twenty-four hour clock which governs NPC schedules and some enemies' behaviors. Each day is part of a seven-day week that begins on Monday (the fictional ""Skyday"" replaces Friday). Time of day is especially important in Grillin' Village, where most businesses and residences are only open during specific hours, some of which may be closed on certain days of the week.The in-game clock also dictates Musashi's fatigue level, which is indicated by his ""Tired"" percentage. Over time, Musashi will become increasingly fatigued, and the speed of his actions will suffer as a result. Between 50% to 69% Tired, Musashi becomes unable to run. At 70% Tired, his movement and attack speed are drastically reduced. At maximum fatigue, Musashi will pass out and won't respond until he regains a certain amount of stamina. While asleep, Musashi is still vulnerable to attack from any nearby enemies. Musashi's fatigue can be reduced by consuming certain foods, sleeping at the village's inn, or visiting Musashi's private quarters inside Allucaneet Palace. Musashi can also sleep on the ground, although this only reduces his Tired level to a minimum of 20% unless the L-Quilt is also equipped.Elusive creatures called Minku can be found at specific locations throughout the world (indicated by their pink-colored dung) between the hours of 10 PM and 5 AM. Minku are harmless, but very fast; if Musashi can catch one, it will drop a rare ""Longevity Berry"" that permanently increases his maximum HP. </div>  <div> Characters : At the outset of Chapter 2, Ribson and Livers invite Musashi to stay at the royal palace while he searches for the Five Scrolls. In addition to his own private quarters, Musashi can enter Allucaneet Palace's dining hall to visit Ribson and any palace residents that have been rescued from Bincho Fields.

Breath of Fire III,Capcom,Capcom,"April 30, 1998",ps,Breath of Fire III is a popular Japanese RPG made by Capcom. The game follows the story of Ryu - who is trying to find out the secret behind his ability to change into a dragon.,3030-19349,19349,0,1997-09-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/breath-of-fire-iii/3030-19349/,PEGI: 7+," <div> Overview : Breath of Fire III was developed and published by Capcom for the original PlayStation console. First released in Japan in 1997, Breath of Fire III puts the player in the role of Ryu who is discovered in a mine and has the mysterious power to turn into dragons. The story follows Ryu and his companions as they search for the truth in Ryu's past and where his blood will lead him. Set in a fantasy world with steampunk vibes, this is first Breath of Fire game to be presented in 3D.  </div>  <div> Plot :  Breath of Fire III is set in a fantasy world with hints of modern and steampunk technology. Often this world is compared to ""Medieval Europe"" in its style. The populous of this world are both human and human-animal like creatures drawn with an anime style. In recent years, technological advancement comes, thanks to a compound known as ""Chrysm"", a rare stone like substance that is in-fact fossilized dragon bone. Hints of a lost civilization are strewn across the world in the form of robots and heavy machinery, much of the plot is based on discovering its origin and it's link to the disappearance of the strong dragon race, 'the Brood', centuries ago.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ryu encased in ChrysmThe story begins in a 'Chrysm' mine when a large piece of 'Chrysm' is blown apart. From the debris a baby dragon emerges and begins attacking the miners, throwing the mine into pandemonium. Eventually the baby dragon, or whelp, is knocked out and taken aboard a train for study. During the whelp's train trip it jostles the cage it's in, and falls down a steep bank breaking the cage open; the Whelp rolls toward the shade of a tree. Very weak, it transforms into Ryu and passes out. Later Ryu is found by Rei and Teepo and this is where Ryu's adventure begins..... </div>  <div> Battle System :  The Brood were a great race of dragons who could take human form, mostly peaceful but extremely powerful. Seen as a threat by the Goddesses, they were hunted by the Guardians, of which Garr is one. Assumed to be extinct until Ryu was discovered. Their fossilized remains are sometimes known as 'Chrysm' which is highly sort after for it's power and magic effects. </div>  <div> Audio : The game is presented in an overhead  Isometric view which is not locked to any specific view point (unless a cutscene is in progress), the player may rotate and tilt the camera at will to discover secrets or solve puzzles. Every character has a 'field ability' which they can use in the world environment this is used in conjunction with the camera to solve puzzles or destroy objects in the path of the player. Although the PlayStation allowed the world to be presented in 3D all the characters are anime style 2D sprites.The Faeries of the Faerie Village   </div> "
Breath of Fire IV,Capcom,Capcom,"November 30, 2000",ps,Take a journey with Ryu and Fou-lu as they fight against each other in a world torn by war and watched over by mysterious dragons called 'the Endless'.,3030-9177,9177,0,2000-11-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/breath-of-fire-iv/3030-9177/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Breath of Fire IV is a JRPG set in a world based on European and Japanese Folklore designed by Tatsuya Yoshikawa. The world is divided by two main factions: the Western Fou Empire and the Eastern Kingdoms. The first is modeled on Eastern Asia and feudal China, and the second on Arabia and Medieval Europe. At the start of the game the two factions are in uneasy peace after years of War, but this is under threat thanks to Military personnel on both sides.The world is filled with many different kinds of races and humans, all drawn in a detailed anime sprite style. Many of the races are based on real world animals but with human traits. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is mainly viewed from an isometric view very similar to Breath of Fire III the player is able to rotate the camera around any area 360 degrees. But is unable to tilt a feature that was in Breath of Fire III. Battles take place in the area the player is exploring, there is no separate battle area in which the characters fight.Players help Ryu (and in some cases Fou-lu, see below) explore the gameworld, using various methods, to discover their destiny. </div>  <div> Story : A battle in the dessert.In Breath of Fire IV the battles take place in an approximation of the area the player is exploring (much like in the previous title Breath of Fire III), teams of up to three characters fight enemies in a turn based style attacking with magic and physical means to reduce their HP to zero. However the 'back row' contains all the other characters and in place of another action the player can 'swap-out' characters much like in a tag team match; whilst characters are in the back row they regain health and magic power. </div>  <div> Characters : A combo system, new to the franchise, enables the player to combine spells and actions from different characters to create a more powerful attack. For example if two players cast lighting on an enemy the their spells are combined to create a more powerful electric attack; combining different kinds of spells an also wield devastating results. Some single attacks, having multiple effects can have the same effect as a combo. </div>  <div> Dragon forms and transformations : Nina discovers Ryu at the start of the game. Naked.Breath of Fire IV's story starts as Nina is in search of her older sister, Elina, who went missing on a diplomatic mission. As Nina searches towns along the 'great desert' with Cray in tow she happens upon a crater scarred in the ground where an abnormal object has fallen. Investigating more she is confronted by a large Dragon whom transforms into Ryu before her very eyes. Naked. Ryu, remembering nothing of his origins is persuaded to join Nina in her search for her sister.And so the story begins, and it unfolds the focus is drawn more to Ryu and Fou-lu as the player switches between control of both characters at completely different sides of the world. The struggle between these two characters and there drives are at end and this element creates a compelling and interesting storyline. </div>  <div> Development and translation : RyuThe player mainly plays as Ryu. Ryu at the start of the game is found naked and with no memory of who is is or where he came from. This is a staple in the Breath of Fire series most of the titles have a similar beginning. Ryu discovers quickly he has the power to transform into Dragons gaining different forms as the game progresses. </div>  <div> Censorship : Fou-LuThe player also takes control of the antagonist, Fou-lu at certain points in the game. Fou-lo is the founder of the ' Western Fou Empire', which he founded centuries ago. Fou-lo is referred to as the God-Emperor, because he seems never to die, and seeks to take over the world and rule it as a god. However he needs Ryu to attain this goal.Note: Both Ryu and Fou-lu are actually of the same creation. Originally one being summoned from the realm of gods, they were split in a incantation ceremony when it went wrong; cast across the world and misplaced in time. </div>  <div> Related releases : NinaNina, a white winged human, is the Heroin of Breath of Fire IV and joins Ryu early in the game, sharing her name and subtle likeness with the Heroines of the previous Breath of Fire games; she is a great magic user and is princess to the . </div>  <div> Soundtrack : captionCray joins Ryu in his quest and is a member of a cat like race of the Woren tribe. He is of heavy build and carries a large wooden post concentrating on physical attacks and skills. A subplot involves Cray's affection for Nina's sister: Elina. </div> "

This version instead uses a remix of the song that would replace the music on most other ports. </div> "

It tries to appeal to a very young audience with its extremely simplistic gameplay and bright, colorful graphics. It was released on the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC, and Game Boy Color. </div>  <div> Gameplay (PSX, N64, PC) : Each game level begins with either a still or clip from the movie depending on what version of the game is being played. The player is then given control over the main character ' Flik' and the level begins. The general purpose of the levels are to collect items, avoid or fight enemies, and use the seeds and plants around the environment to navigate the way to the end.The game features a unique seed mechanic where players were able to move around seeds and change their color, effectively influencing what grows from the seed allowing access to hidden items and previously unreachable areas.The items collected are not needed for the player to continue to the next level, however they usually grant the player benefits such as extra lives if all four of the letters that make up Flik's name are found.Flik has two main attacks in the game. While jumping in the air, he can stomp the ground similar to the attack in Mario 64. As well as that, he has a limitless supply of berries that can be upgraded and changed throughout the level. Some enemies can simply not be harmed and have to be avoided. An example would be the bird which in one level, as in the movie, chases Flik through a labyrinth series of cracks in the dirt. </div>  <div> Platform Differences : A memorable sequence in the game featured Flik using dandelions to glide across a levelAll versions of the game except for the Game Boy Color version are the same game apart from some cosmetic differences. No version features in game cut scenes choosing to instead use clips from the movie to set up the premise for each level.The Nintendo 64 version did not feature these however due to its cartridge based format. Instead they relied on a still from the movie before each level with a short sentence describing what was happening.The Game Boy Color version was a simple 2D platform game that offered a little more challenge to the older audience than its 3D counterparts did. </div> "

Burning Road,TokaJP,Funsoft,"September 30, 1996",ps,"Arcade racing game for the Playstation by French developer Toka. Inspired by Sega's Daytona USA and referred to by reviewers as ""a Daytona USA clone"".",3030-24318,24318,0,1996-09-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/burning-road/3030-24318/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Burning Road  is an arcade racing game exclusively available for the Playstation console. It was developed by French developer Toka and published in the US in 1996 by Playmates Interactive Entertainment. The game shares many similarities with its arcade counterparts (such as Daytona USA), ranging from the time limit imposed on course and transmission selection, loose physics and a short range radar that shows the traffic immediately surrounding the player's vehicle.The game is notable for including a full race replay at the conclusion of the race, which is something that was extremely uncommon at the time. Additionally, it supports link mode for two players to race head to head on two Playstation consoles and two televisions. Finally, the game supported the official analog controllers at the time (steering wheel, dual analog, flight stick, etc). </div>  <div> Courses : Three courses are available to race on and it's possible to race each in ""mirror"" (reversed) mode by simply turning around at the start of the race. After a brief period of being told that it's the incorrect direction, the race will continue as normal in the opposite direction. After completing the three tracks on ""Championship"" mode, the next three are done on the reversed versions.Beginner - A European-themed course, with green countrysides and windmills providing scenery throughout the fairly basic, roughly tri-ovular track. A helicopter hangs low above one of the jumps. Some obvious nods to Daytona USA's easy track, such as a cliffside with the company's logo on it (echoing the similar placement of Sonic in Daytona USA).Advanced - South American jungle-themed course with rickety bridges, an ancient temple, waterfalls and even a snow and ice covered portion. A stunt plane flies above the course at set points for added scenery.Expert - Rain drenched nighttime cityscape with sharp right angle turns at points. Contains an airport with a low flying jet that passes over the course towards the end of the lap. </div>  <div> Cars : There are four vehicles from which to choose. Each has differing statistics for handling, maximum speed and acceleration. None of the cars have names associated with them in the game or in the supporting documentation.Blue  w/ White Stripes - Second lowest acceleration, second highest handling and the second lowest speed. Has, ""Toka"" on the front side of the car. When racing against AI opponents, their versions of this car will be in different colors.Red w/ Fox Logo - Second highest acceleration, but the weak handling make this the most difficult car in the game to use. Its mass is roughly equivalent to the blue car's, making it difficult to offensively push opponents into the wall and off the track.Black Monster Truck - Superb handling but a low top speed. Highest mass and best handling of the available cars allows the driver to play a more offensive game, manipulating opposing racers into crashing into walls, each other, or simply driving off the road (and thus rapidly losing speed).Yellow  and Green w/ Nitro decal - Highest acceleration and highest speed. While the handling is second lowest, its mass is second highest. This offers the driver an unparalleled amount of freedom in balancing their offensive and defensive driving. Considered by the fanbase to be the best of the available cars. </div>  <div> Reception : Burning Road met with a lukewarm response from critics, with Gamespot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann awarding it a 6.0 (""Fair"") and stating, ""Burning Road is,  for the most part, a Daytona USA wannabe"" ( link). Many other reviewers noted the similarities between it and Daytona USA, citing its aforementioned time limits and radar in addition to the musical selection, announcer's voice, crash view, hood deformation and physics. </div>  <div> Legacy : While a direct sequel would never be  made, Toka did release a spiritual successor in the form of  Explosive  Racing (X.Racing in Japan), though it would not be released in the  United States. </div> "

Bushido Blade,Square,Sony Computer Entertainment,"October 1, 1997",ps,"A martial arts fighting game released in 1997. It was the most realistic fighting game of its time. The game's ""high-damage"", nearly-one-hit-kill combat system won it many commendations and a fan following, but it has rarely been featured in other games.",3030-6399,6399,0,1997-09-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/bushido-blade/3030-6399/,CERO: C," <div> Gameplay : Bushido Blade is a one-on-one fighting game in 3D environments. In many of the stages, the environment is able to be interacted with, such as in the bamboo forest. Others, such as the castle compound at which most of the game takes place, offer some amount of navigation into different areas of the stage, including a moat area, and a cherry blossom grove. Characters are able to run, jump, and climb in these stages.The actual fighting in Bushido Blade is unique among the fighting game genre. There is no time limit and there are no health gauges. Most attacks, if landed on the enemy, will result in an instant death. Other attacks will wound the enemy, hampering their movement and attacks, even reducing the other character to crawling. This 'Body Damage System' allowed players to whittle each other down in a strategic manner. Blood was added to the North American release of the game.There are eight different weapons in Bushido Blade: the katana, the nodachi, the long sword, the saber, the broadsword, the naginata, the rapier, and the sledgehammer. Each weapon has realistic weight and length; each weapon has a fixed value for power, speed, and blocking ability. The game's 'Motion Shift System' enables players to string together a chain of timed attacks. Many attacks are only available in one of three stances: low, neutral, and high. Each of the characters in the game also have a different level of strength and speed, as well as a number of special attacks. As such, all of the characters have different skill levels with each of the weapon types. Some characters have a throwable subweapon in addition to their main weapon. </div>  <div> Plot : Bushido Blade takes place during an unknown period on an island near the southern mountains of Japan. A fictional, five century year-old dojo known as Meikyokan lies within this region, and teaches the disciplines of the master Narukagami Shinto. A society of assassins known as Kage also resides within the dojo. Once led by the honorable swordsman Utsusemi, he lost his position to Hanzaki, another skilled member of the dojo, in a fierce battle. Hanzaki gained respect as the Kage leader, until he discovered a cursed sword known as Yugiri. He began to change, disregarding the groups honor and the traditions held by its students.One day, a Kage escapes the confines of the dojo with its secrets. Several other members of the society, under penalty of death, are sent to dispatch the defector, only catching up to him (or her) within the ruins of the surrounding Yin and Yang Labyrinth Castle. The player takes on the role of the escaped assassin, fighting his or her way out by killing comrades one by one. The game story differs with each character selected. </div>  <div> Characters : The game contains six playable characters:Utsusemi is the former Meikyokan dojo master, having previously handed off his duties to Hanzaki. He turns his interest to training his son, Tatsumi until Hanzaki begins abusing his power.Tatsumi is the young son of Utsusemi and, although not a member of Kage, he has lived among them most of his life. His novice swordsmanship is put to the test when he attempts to escape the compound.Red Shadow is a skilled female assassin who joined Kage under Utsusemi's guidance. Fearing the worst for her master, she sets out to confront Hanzaki before Utsusemi can.Mikado is a former shrine maiden who eventually found her way to Kage. She leaves the group in hopes of returning to her former life.Kannuki is an assassin whose entire village in the Ryukyu Islands was slaughtered by Black Lotus, a fellow member of Kage. Upon discovering it was by Hanzaki's order, Kannuki sets out to destroy them both.Black Lotus is a loyal member of Kage who strictly follows the code of Bushido. After slaughtering all the villagers in Kannuki's hometown, Black Lotus begins to question his loyalty to Hanzaki and seeks answers. </div> "

Bust a Groove,Metro Graphics,SCEE,"November 15, 1998",ps,"While grossly overlooked in the U.S. market, Bust A Groove served as a gateway for many Japanese music game fans in the late 1990s, arriving on the scene courtesy of Enix and 989 Studios hot on the heels of Parappa the Rapper.",3030-19513,19513,0,1998-10-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/bust-a-groove/3030-19513/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Bust-a-groove was released in 1998 for the PlayStation, following the music game successes of games such as Beatmania and Parappa. In Japan, the series is known under the name Bust A Move, however, in the United States, by that time, the Bust A Move name was already trademarked for use by Taito's popular Puzzle Bobble series. While Bust A Move was developed by Enix prior to its merger with Square Soft, in the United States, the domestication was handled by Sony's defunct 989 Studios. Enix continued the series for two more entries beyond Bust A Groove, with the third, which is one of the final games published by Enix prior to the aforementioned Square merger, never being released outside of Japan. The series features various colorful characters who must do battle through dance to a variety of music genres, which reflect the personality of the character associated to the stage. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game involves pressing various button combinations in time to the music to outperform your opponent and win the competition. Each measure of the song is broken into four beats and players must enter directional commands without being tied to the song's timing, but the move is executed by pressing the indicated onscreen button on exactly beat four of the measure. Each dancer also has a unique special move which can be used twice per song by pressing triangle on the fourth beat of a measure to throw your opponent off and temporarily stun them for a few measures. However, once an attack is launched, the opponent can dodge the attack by pressing square on the fourth beat of the measure. A character's dance moves are broken up into levels (indicated by an on-screen gauge) and by choosing more difficult commands, players can level up faster, opening up more impressive and higher-scoring dance moves. At certain points of a dance string, a player is given two choices of commands, the top branch leading to easier, but lower-scoring commands, and the top branch leading to more complex and higher-scoring commands. Dance moves are strung together until the player reaches a pre-determined pose move after five combos. After five dance moves, the player can still execute three levels of moves depending on their current dance level, labeled with the terms (from lowest to highest) ""COOL"", ""CHILLIN'"" and ""FREEZE."" After a successful pose input, dance commands won't appear for one measure, after which the player begins a new dance string.A majority of the song length is spent with both players freely following this format but at predetermined sections of each song are solo segments where players execute two to four measures of commands individually with unique moves (each character has one hidden solo string that awards massive points). During solos, players are not able to attack each other, however, if a player is hit by an attack just before entering a solo, they can potentially miss one or two measures of inputs. Each successful dance move awards a number of points to the player and the player with the highest score at the end of the song is the winner (draws are also possible). While no points indicator is displayed onscreen, the camera scrolls toward the character with the highest score and if a player is seriously crushing the opponent, the camera focuses solely on their player with the opponent being completely ignored and off camera. Much like the background reflections of performance seen in Parappa, at certain point intervals, crazy events begin triggering in the backgrounds and if the winning player reaches a set point total, a ""Fever Time"" animation is triggered where the winning character does a victory solo dance. While the series never reached the popularity of games such as Parappa or DanceDanceRevolution, it has a very dedicated cult following and is known for its competitive nature.The most noted highlight of the series lies in its diverse cast of wacky characters, each of which favors and exemplifies a particular genre of music. With the characters comes a surprisingly deep catalog of back stories that brings each character to the competition. Bust A Groove isn't merely a standard dance tournament, but, instead, the winner of the tournament challenges Robo-Z, a 50-foot robot skilled in dance that houses an energy known as Groovetron. If Robo-Z is defeated, the winner is granted the powers of Groovetron and obtaining this power is the motivation that drives the characters to enter the tournament. Upon clearing the game, the player is treated to a short CGI movie which details the aftermath of the tournament and how the character chooses to use this power.Bust A Groove features three game modes - an arcade-style single player mode, a two-player versus mode and a training mode. The single-player mode pits your chosen character against the roster of selectable characters with special battles in the middle and end of the mode. The ""mid-boss"" is a pair of aliens skilled in the dance/martial art of Capoeria, while the final boss is the already detailed Robo-Z. Through extended game play, players can unlock both of these bosses, as well as two other mascot characters. After beating the game with a character, the player may also enter a dance view mode where every dance animation the character uses in-game can be viewed. </div>  <div> Characters : CharacterDescription HeatHeat was a former professional race car driver, but this all ended after a serious accident. Upon recovering, he realized he could now control the element of fire and isn't afraid to use it during dance battles. Heat's stage is an abandoned warehouse surrounded by flames. By accumulating enough points during the stage, the windows begin breaking and the intensity of the flames increase. Heat is dressed in a flame-embroidered jump suit and dances with b-boy flair. When attacking, Heat assumes a ""Dragon Ball Z power-up""-type pose, channeling a burst of fire, which is launched into the air and down on top of the opponent. His stage's song is entitled ""2 Bad,"" a fast-tempoed breakbeat song with male rapping lyrics describing Heat's superior dancing. Most people tend to not be able to understand the female sample, ""Straight up!,"" repeated through most of the song. Heat seeks the power of Groovetron in order to get his career back on track and strengthen his control of fire. </div>  <div> Trivial Information :  FridaFrida is an artist who embraces hip-hop and urban culture. She dances with a pop-lock style and is looking to take first place in the tournament and absorb Groovetron in order to bring her art to life. Frida's stage is a seaside shack where she resides and practices her craft of painting. Frida has blue hair, camo pants and an orange shirt and attacks by painting a picture of a wolf, which then attacks the opponent. Her stage's song is Sora to Umi to Niji no Yume (""Dream of Sky, Sea and Rainbows""), a hip-hop style song featuring female Japanese vocals and a short chorus of male rapping. </div>  <div> Soundtrack :  Hiro""The Natural Playboy"" Hiro-kun is the embodiment of John Travolta, straight out of Saturday Night Fever. Hiro is totally obsessed with himself and is billed as a ladies' man, however, he oddly passes the time in between Saturdays, fixed in front of his computer. By entering the tournament, Hiro hopes to use the power of Groovetron to bring on an endless Saturday. Hiro dresses in a white leisure suit and dances with a '70's disco style at the local disco, Dance Fashion. When Hiro wants to get dirty, he attacks by flinging a glossy photo of himself at the opponent. Performing well on the stage will trigger a number of lights and stage effects on the dance floor. The stage's song, ""Natural Playboy"" further reflects Hiro's narcissism as it is essentially a song about how great he is. </div> "

The updated version included two more characters - Joe Higashi & Dan Hibiki. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  The gameplay in the game is styled more after the SNK games rather than the Capcom games. The game uses four buttons instead of six - Light Punch, Hard Punch, Light Kick, Hard Kick. Techniques can be done using combinations of those four buttons.Capcom VS SNK has a couple of basic moves. The First is the Roll mechanic which is done by pressing the Light punch and Light kick simultaneously. It temporarily renders the player's character invincible and it's useful for evading attacks. Some other basic moves include Throw and Tech Throw; the Throw is done by pressing forward or back on the D-Pad or Joystick and pressing Hard punch or Hard kick simultaneously. The Tech Throw is a cancel Throw that is done by pressing forward or back when the player is about to be thrown. The other basic moves in the game is dashing or running that the player can choose to use in the options menu. The Dash is done tapping forward or back on the Joystick or D-Pad and same thing for the run. </div>  <div> Presentation  :  Before a match, the roster is broking up into four Ratio tiers; each character is place in the Ratio tiers in terms of their offense and defense. The player is given four ""points"" and can spend those points by picking their characters; for example, Ryu & Kyo. So the player can spent all four points by picking Ryu & Kyo and have a team of two. Or can have a team of four if the player decides to pick just the Ratio one character like Sakura & Yuri.Ratio 1: Weak Offense, Weak DefenseRatio 2: Average Offense, Average DefenseRatio 3: Strong Offense, Strong DefenseRatio 4: Strongest Offense, Strongest Defense </div>  <div> Characters : The Grooves. The game features two ""Grooves"" that the player can select before he or she picks her characters. Each Grooves determine how the special meters are used during a fight. Capcom Groove: The Capcom groove is similar to the      Street Fighter Alpha super meter were the players is given three levels of super.SNK Groove: The SNK groove, based on the super meter in      The King of Fighters '94, is used by charging up the character by pressing the Hard punch and Hard kick button simultaneously. The other feature of the SNK groove is when the player's health bar gets decrease at a certain point where it's blinking, the player can perform unlimited amounts of super moves.  </div>  <div> Soundtrack List : The Sakazaki stage All of the SNK characters are fully redrawn for the game and some of the Capcom characters as well. But as for the rest of the characters have not been redrawn; their sprites have been taken from where they originated -   Street Fighter Alpha and  Darkstalkers. 3D visual have been used for the projectiles attacks and other effects to give the game a unique look. The stages have special intros for all the stages - which is a bit of a nod to some of the SNK fighting games. Some of the stages have neat little effects; for example, in the Sakazaki stage, when a character gets slammed into the ground, the roof starts to slowly collapse. </div> "

The game also introduces numerous RPG elements to the series, including attribute, inventory, and experience systems.The story of Symphony of the Night starts with a reprise of the final fight between vampire hunter Richter Belmont and the vampire lord Dracula at the end of Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. The game then fast forwards four years later, in the year 1796, where Dracula's castle reappears out of the mist and Richter mysteriously disappears. Players then begin the main game as Dracula's dhampir son Alucard, who awakens from his self-induced sleep (sometime after the events of Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse) to investigate. On the way, he encounters Maria Renard, Richter's sister-in-law and fellow vampire hunter who is also searching for Richter.The game received a Japanese-exclusive port to the Sega Saturn on June 25, 1998, adding unique features (including new items, two exclusive areas, and Maria as a playable character). It later received a port by Backbone to the Xbox 360, released digitally on March 21, 2007. This version was notable for being the Xbox Live Arcade game to exceed the original 50 megabyte size restriction. The original game was also digitally re-released as a ""PSone Classics"" title for supporting PlayStation Network platforms in North America on July 19, 2007, with later releases in Japan (on December 16, 2010) and Europe (on December 12, 2012).The game was later included as an unlockable part of the 2007 PlayStation Portable compilation Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles. This version contains some bonus content (including Maria as a playable character, albeit with a different playstyle) and features re-recorded English voice acting (with an updated script). This version was later included in the 2018 PlayStation 4 compilation Castlevania Requiem: Symphony of the Night & Rondo of Blood. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is a non-linear, Metroidvania-style, side-scrolling, action-adventure platformer game. Alucard, the main character, will navigate the many sectors of Dracula's castle with flexibility in his progression. The castle is maze like, with many hidden passages, deadly obstacles, and increasingly difficult enemies. The game incorporates the classic Castlevania platform gameplay, and mixes it with the exploration of titles like Super Metroid and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. To progress, Alucard must gather powers, defeat bosses, and discover the secrets of Dracula's domain.Symphony of the Night is the first Castlevania title to allow players to use other primary weapons besides whips, which was traditional in the series prior to this game. Alucard's repertoire, however, is mostly based on edged weapons, such as axes and swords. Other weapons, such as fist weapons and single use, expendable weapons, are available though much less common. Symphony of the Night's alternate characters, Richter and Maria, have unique weapons. Richter plays like characters in the previous titles, wielding the legendary Vampire Killer and utilizing classic sub-weapons. Maria uses energy-based projectiles and kicks to do battle. Armor and accessories could also be equipped, granting the player bonuses to all of their characters stats. The Sega Saturn version expands on the items in the game, and has many bonus weapons and armor sets.Players could also pick up other items, such as food, to help replenish health and hearts. Items such as the classic Castlevania haunch of meat will replenish health, while sweet treats like ice cream generally refill Alucard's hearts. Players must be wary, however, as not everything is good for the character's stomach. Poison mushrooms, rotten meat, and other unsavory goods will cause status effects, among other harmful effects. These items do not have effect upon contact, as in past Castlevania titles. Rather, they will be placed in the inventory, and must be equipped to one of Alucard's arms. Once equipped, pressing the button the food is assigned to will throw them out, and Alucard can use them.Sub-weapons also make a return in Symphony of the Night, including old favorites like Holy Water and the Throwing axe. These sub-weapons consume hearts, which can be regenerated by picking up additional hearts, dropped by enemies, as well as lights sources once Alucard obtains the Cube of Zoe. Item crashes return from the previous game, which are special powered up versions of the equipped sub-weapon. Only Maria and Richter can perform item crashes. Each weapon has different effects depending on what character uses them. Along with sub-weapons, special creatures could be equipped as aids in combat. These creatures, called familiars, include fairies and demons. Familiars have a variety of different effects in combat, including healing, fighting, and defense. These familiars level up along with Alucard, becoming stronger with each level.Symphony of the Night also introduces a magic system to the series. Players can perform various spells for attacking and healing by pressing secret button combinations. There are a number of attack spells, such as Hellfire, and others that heal, such as Dark Metamorphosis, which heals Alucard any time he spills blood from an enemy. The player can buy Incantation Scrolls in the Library, but they are not needed to unlock the ability to perform the spells.Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is vastly different from previous entries in the series. There are still candles that contain hearts and sub-weapons, but they are functionally different. The game also deviates from the traditional linear level format, much like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. While progress is still limited by items and abilities granted by defeating bosses and exploring the map, the player can choose where to go (A number of tricks and glitches also allows them, with enough know how, to get into places they shouldn't be). In another break from tradition, Symphony of the Night introduces an entire armory allowing Alucard to wield anything from a standard sword to brass knuckles to sticks of dynamite. Previous Castlevania titles only allowed for the whip and two upgrades for it, never allowing alternate equips. Upon finding certain relics, the player can choose to have a familiar follow them. The Fairy provides healing when damaged and antidotes when poisoned. The Bat, Sword, Ghost, and Demon are all combat-oriented. Some of them are necessary to access hidden areas. The active familiar will gain experience with every monster you kill, increasing that familiar's skill in battle or in support.Relics are hidden throughout the castle which provide or upgrade Alucard's abilities . Relics will allow him to jump higher, collect hearts and items from light sources, equip familiars, and open sealed doors, among other things. These can be turned on and off in the menu screen. Some relics will allow Alucard to transform into beasts or mist. The first transformation is the wolf, who can run faster, and make long, running jumps. The wolf attacks with a short ranged bite. The second transformation is the bat, similar to Alucard's power in Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, which can fly freely around the stages. Finally, the mist power will allow Alucard to float around, through grates and other obstacles impassable by other states of matter. The mist can also be upgraded to a poison mist, which damages enemies. When in these forms, Alucard's MP will slowly be drained. Each for becomes necessary to advance in the game, and obtain many hidden secrets.Symphony of the Night was the second Castlevania game to feature RPG elements, after Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Enemies give experience points when killed, and Alucard will level up after gaining the required experience. Alucard can also gather Life Max and Heart Max upgrades. These RPG elements have become a mainstay mechanic in the series since, as have many other elements of Symphony of the Night. </div>  <div> Ports : In most versions of the game, it is possible for the player to take control of Richter Belmont, the vampire hunter. After satisfying certain conditions, the player can enter their name as ""RICHTER"" and they will be put in his shoes to explore Castlevania. Richter does not collect items, cannot equip anything, does not find relics, cannot use familiars, and does not level up. Playing as Richter is very much like previous games, with more limited character mobility. He does not have any MP, and his heart maximum capacity is 99. Heart Max items only replenish hearts. He can, however, increase his life maximum when he collects life max up items. His only primary weapon is the vampire killer, which cannot be powered up (save his whip item crash and increased power in the inverted castle). Richter wields the same sub-weapons as Alucard, but has the ability to perform and item crash that eats up a large number of hearts, and performs a strong attack. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Dagger: The weakest of all sub-weapons, yet very fast, and costs a single heart.Axe: Alucard tosses a round axe into the air. A great weapon for taking out airborne foes.Holy Cross: Alucard will throw a spinning cross a short distance in the air before returning like a boomerang, damaging enemies on the way.Bibuti: Alucard will throw holy ashes onto the ground, which do damage to anything that touches them.Holy Water: The character throws a bottle of holy water on the ground, which will burst into blue flames, damaging anything that touches them.Watch: Freezes time. It has no effect on many enemies.Bible: A bible will come out, and rapidly spin around Alucard, acting as a sort of shield before flying off.Rebound Stone: Alucard throws a single diamond that will ricochet off of walls and damage enemies. Best used in tight spaces.Agunea: Shoots sacred lightning at enemies. It can be continuously used if the player holds down up and the attack button.Crucifix: The ultimate sub-weapon, attacks like Richter's cross item crash, bringing a large cross on screen to damage everything. Will eat up 100 hearts. </div> "

ChronoCross takes the series in a new direction as it expands the predecessor's focus on time travel for a story about alternate universes, as well as debuting a new turn-based combat system, a new art style and a very enlarged new cast of 45 playable characters. The game also includes several series staple features such the New Game Plus and series hallmark multiple endings. Released for the PlayStation in 2000, Chrono Cross received wide critical and commercial success, and went on to join the PlayStation's Greatest Hits library. </div>  <div> Story : Serge and the Frozen FlameChrono Cross follows a boy named Serge, and takes place in a tropical archipelago called El Nido. After a freak occurrence, Serge finds himself in an alternate dimension in which he has been dead for 10 years. While searching for the answer behind his death, Serge runs into a young girl, a thief named Kid. Together they set out on a journey to solve the questions surrounding Serge's death, as well as hunt down Kid's nemesis, a cat-man named Lynx, and retrieve an ancient artifact known as the Frozen Flame. After chasing Lynx for some time, Lynx gets the upper hand. He uses another artifact called the Dragon's Tear to switch bodies with Serge, and banish him to a strange realm known as the Temporal Vortex. Serge eventually escapes the Temporal Vortex, and begins searching for a way to get his body back from Lynx, which leads him to an area called the Dead Sea. There Serge does find the Frozen Flame, but it is guarded by a man named Miguel. After Serge defeats Miguel, the entity known as FATE destroys the Dead Sea to protect the Frozen Flame. Serge barely escapes with the help of the legendary Dragons. He is also able to retrieve his body with the aid of the Dragons, and then heads to a research facility called Chronopolis. There, Serge defeats both Lynx and FATE, which allows the Dragons to swoop in and take the Frozen Flame. It is then that the Dragons merge to form the ancient Dragon God and raise the massive structure known as Terra Tower, thus becoming the new primary villain(s).The DragonsUpon traveling to Terra Tower, Serge meets a prophet named Belthasar (the same Prophet of Time from Chrono Trigger). Belthasar divulges much information to Serge, including the history of El Nido, Chronopolis, and the Dragon God. He also informs Serge that a girl named Schala (the princess of the Kingdom of Zeal from Chrono Trigger) has been trapped in a place called the Darkness Beyond Time along with a terrible creature called Lavos, who was the primary villain from Chrono Trigger. It seems their presence together has caused Schala and Lavos to begin merging, and the resulting creature (later called the Time Devourer) would be capable of destroying all spacetime. Belthasar also talks about the role of Serge and Kid in all of this. He reveals that he created Kid as a clone of Schala, and set in motion all of the events of the game that have brought Serge to this point. He calls this plan Project Kid, and states that its purpose will soon be revealed. With this new information in hand, Serge defeats the Dragon God at the top of Terra Tower, then heads back to the point where he first encountered the dimensional split. There he finds apparitions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca- some of the main protagonists from Chrono Trigger. They tell Serge that the purpose of Project Kid was indeed to free Schala from the Time Devourer. Serge moves forward, and defeats the Time Devourer. By using the mysterious seventh element known as the Chrono Cross, Serge is also able to free Schala. Schala thanks Serge, and returns him to his home. Serge forgets the whole adventure upon returning home.Chrono Cross' story plays heavily off the idea of the parallel dimensions found in the game. For a large portion of the game, the player can travel between the two dimensions, and will frequently encounter the same character in each dimension. Often times the two versions of a character will be very different, which reveals one of the game's major themes- every choice someone makes creates once future and destroys another simultaneously. The two dimensions represent two parallel worlds that are almost completely different, due to the diverging choices its inhabitants have made over the years, even though it is technically the same world. Chrono Cross also contains numerous references to its predecessor, Chrono Trigger. Many are obvious, such as the appearance of important characters such as Crono, Marle, Lucca, Belthasar, Schala, and Lavos. Other characters are mentioned in passing, such as Robo. Others still are referenced in a more subtle way- Frog and Magus are represented by other characters who are not at all related to them, but share likenesses. Events in Chrono Trigger are also referenced on occasion, and the ruins found in Chrono Trigger's futuristic era can even be found in the Dead Sea. Various items, such as the Masamune, also make a reappearance. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The World MapSimilar to Chrono Trigger, Cross Cross has no random encounters. Enemies are visible from the overworld, and a battle is only initiated if the player makes contact with the monster. Chrono Cross‚Äô battles revolve around the six elements in the game, which are designated by the six colors: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, and Black. Chrono Cross' magical system is centered around these elements, as each spell or item in the game is labeled under an element. Characters have a certain number of slots in which they can equip elements, and thus use them in battle. These six elements occur in three pairs of opposed types: Red/Blue, Green/Yellow, and White/Black. Every character and monster in the game has an innate element, and elemental attacks deal more damage to a character or monster of an opposing element. For example, a blue elemental spell will deal extra damage to a character whose innate element is red, and vice versa. Also, the game keeps track of the three most recently used elements, which is displayed in an upper corner under the label ""Field Effect"". Once the field effect becomes one color (that is, three elements of the same color are cast in a row), then elements of that color will receive a power boost. Summon spells, the ultimate attacks in the game, can only be cast if the ""Field Effect"" is entirely of the proper color.A battle in Chrono CrossAnother big feature in Chrono Cross' battles is the stamina bar. Characters and monsters start each battle with 7 stamina. Characters have multiple levels of attack, consuming various amounts of stamina depending on the quality of attack. A character cannot act if his or her stamina falls below 1, and they will lose their turn until their stamina refills (which happens naturally over the course of other character's turns). Also, elements cannot be used until a character has landed a number of blows on an enemy, and they also require stamina to use. Thus, battles in Chrono Cross require players to balance the use of physical and magical attacks, while keeping his or her stamina in check. Also, a standard element can only be used once per battle. Characters do not gain experience points upon completing battles in Chrono Cross. Instead, participating characters receive a small boost to their stats. After defeating a boss, the player is rewarded with a larger stat boost to all characters. Also, weapons and armor are not purchased in shops as in most RPGs. Instead, players collect base materials from monsters they defeat (or from treasure chests), and must take these items to a blacksmith, who can forge them into gear.Finally, Chrono Cross offers a New Game mode upon completion of the main story. Similar to Chrono Trigger's New Game , this mode allows the player to start the game over while keeping everything he or she has already collected- including items, elements, equipment, and party members and their stat upgrades. In fact, there are a few points in the game which require the player to choose one party member over another, and carrying party members over via a New Game is the only way to obtain all 45 playable characters in a single play of the game. Also similar to Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross offers multiple endings, and includes double and triple tech abilities between some characters. </div>  <div> Characters : Chrono Cross has a large cast of characters.

Chrono Trigger follows the exploits of Crono as he and his friends attempt to save the world from a planet-devouring alien creature.",3030-9249,9249,0,1995-03-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/chrono-trigger/3030-9249/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Chrono Trigger is a traditional console role-playing game (RPG) released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 22, 1995 in North America and for the Super Famicom on March 11, 1995 in Japan. The game is well-known for its multiple endings, Active Time Battle system, and time-spanning storyline. Before its release, Chrono Trigger was a highly anticipated collaboration between Squaresoft and freelance members of Enix. The development team was comprised of the same minds behind the popular RPGs Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, earning them the moniker of ""The Dream Team."" The game has sold around 3.5 million copies worldwide across its various ports.At the time of its release, Chrono Trigger received great praise from critics and fans. Due to the game's multiple endings, story, music (by famed Final Fantasy composers Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda), battle system, and detailed graphics, the game was so popular it sold two million copies within the first two months of release. Chrono Trigger has since been hailed as one of the greatest games of all time by various popular gaming websites and magazines (placing in the top 100 of IGN, GameSpot, and Famitsu's best games of all time features). Metacritic lists the Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger with a 92% or ""universal acclaim."" </div>  <div> Development : The development of Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between several influential figures in Japanese game development, including Hironobu Sakaguchi (creator of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series), Yuji Horii (creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series), Nobuo Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series), Yasunori Mitsuda (composer for Chrono Trigger), and Akira Toriyama (creator of the Dragon Ball series and longtime contributor to the Dragon Quest franchise).Chrono Trigger was produced by Kazuhiko Aoki and directed by Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Yuji Horii assisted Hironobu Sakaguchi in the supervision of the game. Yuji Horii, being a large fan of time travel, decided to center the game's plot around time travel. Masato Kato then edited and revised the storyline, and in the process created the idea of multiple endings. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita also assisted in the writing of the script. Other designers working on the game include Tetsuya Takahashi, Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora.Hironobu Sakaguchi has talked about the development process of Chrono Trigger in a positive light. He cited humorous scenes in the game that he said would not be possible in a Final Fantasy game. He also referred to the development of Chrono Trigger as ""playing in Toriyama's universe."" Toriyama had a large influence on the game development. For example, when Squaresoft requested a playable animal character in the game, the team based Frog off of one of Toriyama's sketches.As the game was being developed certain elements were modified from their original designs and ultimately turned into well known parts of the story. When game testers complained about the difficulty and non-linearity of the game, the team added the End of Time so that players could get hints in relation to the next goal. Some of the novel features of the game also proved to be new challenges for the development team, which necessitated extra attention. Sakaguchi required the beta testers to play through the game twice, to confirm that the New Game Plus feature worked.The Famicom and Super Nintendo versions of Chrono Trigger both utilized 32 megabit cartridges that had RAM and battery backup for saving games. As the Japanese and North American versions of the game were developed on different schedules, they do contain some oddities. For example, the Japanese version contains art for the ending of the game and a running count of the amount of items in the player's inventory, and the North American version still contains an unused song for the unfinished Singing Mountain dungeon. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ted Woolsey (an influential figure in translation) was asked to localize the game for North America in only thirty days. He didn't have a modern translation team, so to get the context of the game he had to memorize certain scenarios and read drafts of player's guides to get a feel for the game. Despite these facts, Ted Woolsey still said that this was one of his favorite games to translate.Localization for the North American market changed many things, mostly due to Nintendo of America's stricter standards at the time. References to breastfeeding, alcohol (changed to soda in the North American version), religion, and homosexuality (in the case of Flea, a character who looks physically like a woman but is in reality a man) were either simplified or removed from the game entirely. Localization also changed many of the main characters' names. There are a variety of possible reasons as to why this happened, perhaps because the Japanese names did not sound exotic enough. In the case of a few names, however, there was not enough space for the name to fit using English letters as opposed to Japanese characters. </div>  <div> Plot : According to Hiromichi Tanaka in 2011 and 2013, Chrono Trigger was originally planned to be what eventually became Secret of Mana, which itself was originally intended to be Final Fantasy IV and was produced by the team behind Final Fantasy III (Hiromichi Tanaka and Nasir Gebelli). In Tanaka's own words:After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore‚Ä¶ Instead, it was eventually released as ‚ÄúSeiken Densetsu 2‚Ä≥ (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as ‚ÄúChrono Trigger‚Äù. (laugh)At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.  </div>  <div> Endings : Chrono Trigger takes influence from many elements of traditional Japanese RPG gameplay while abandoning others. For example, it borrows familiar concepts from earlier Final Fantasy games, such as menu and turn based combat, but largely eliminates the RPG staple of random enemy encounters, instead allowing players to view enemies in the field making it possible to avoid many conflicts all together.Another difference from previous RPGs is that actual battles do not occur on the overworld map. In Chrono Trigger battles occur in smaller exploration areas or dungeons where enemies are displayed in the environment. Aside from making encounters optional, having enemies onscreen also helps create a smoother battle transition since the characters will take battle formation in the onscreen environment instead of the game fading to a separate battle screen. The overworld serves to connect these areas with other places of interest such as town. Towns, as is usual in RPGs, contain areas where the party can rest or purchase items, weapons, and armor.Chrono Trigger was the first game to coin the term ""New Game Plus,"" though the actual concept had appeared in other games dating back to the original Legend of Zelda. After completing the game, a player can create a New Game Plus allowing him or her to retain all equipment, levels, and Techs (this game's version of special abilities.) New Game Plus also allows the player to fight Lavos, the final boss of the game, much earlier in the storyline, which is how the game's multiple endings can be unlocked.The time travel aspect of Chrono Trigger transcends story purposes, affecting gameplay as well. Different periods of time become accessible during certain parts of the game. These eras can then be accessed through time portals or (later in the game) through a time traveling device that the party dubs ""Epoch."" Epoch can travel to any time period instantaneously, while the time portals can only lead the player to certain areas in a time period. Side-quests available in the past time periods of the game can influence events in future areas. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Chrono Trigger utilizes the Active Time Battle system, a battle system popularized by the Final Fantasy series. Each character has a bar which scrolls across based on the character's speed. Once the bar is filled, it is that character's turn.Unlike many Japanese role-playing games, there is no transition to a separate battle screen when the party encounters enemies. Instead, when a fight begins, a battle menu simply appears on the current area being traversed by the party (which can be moved between the top and the bottom of the screen). Enemies and characters aren't locked to a single grid either, as they move around the area fluidly. Depending on how the enemies and characters are placed on the field, some attacks have more effectiveness than others (for example, attacks that hit enemies grouped together).In combat, there are three options: Attack, Item, and Tech. Attacking has the character doling out a physical attack. Items are accesible through the second option, providing buffs and healing items. Techs are special abilities that each character can use, both magical and non-magical. Each character has a base magic ability, with abilities such as Water, Lightning, or Shadow (with the exception of Robo, who is a robot and Ayla, who was born before the creation of magic). In addition to individual (or Single) Techs, there are also Double and Triple Techs which involve two and three party members, respectively. Learning a Double or Triple Tech is dependent on which Single Techs the individuals involved have learned. The Double and Triple Techs cost each party member involved a corresponding amount of MP. </div>  <div> Additional Characters : The element of the game which makes it stand out from other RPG's of the time is the tech system. The techs work like standard magic or skills in any other RPG, however Chrono Trigger puts its own spin on things. First off, as opposed to a Final Fantasy where there are dozens of magic options for each character, in Chrono Trigger each character has 10 individual techs which are usually unique to them and their element. These are just solo techs however, a huge element of the battles are the dual and triple techs.To unlock regular techs in the game each battle rewards the player with 3 basic things, money, experience, and tech points. Each character has their own standard of tech points that they need to reach to unlock the next solo tech. Learning dual and triple techs is done completely differently.Dual and triple techs are techs that need either two or three party members turns to be ready. This is generally a strong move where each character performs a version of one of their own solo techs but they combine it with the other party members involved. These techs generally cost a lot of MP and have the added con of using multiple members turns at the same time for one attack.Dual and triple techs are unlocked after playing one battle with the duo or trio in question after they have unlocked the single tech that they perform.When the player begins their journey the first thing they are prompted to do is choose between Active mode and Wait mode. Active mode is the traditional mode which is meant to make the player feel like they are in a rush during battles. During this mode every character has their own ATB bar while the enemies have their own invisible one. When the player is selecting whatever options they want the enemy can attack them at all times.In Wait mode the players characters can be attacked while they are waiting, however once they enter any combat menu the enemies actions freeze completely. This is an easier mode which gives the player some time to think about their actions. </div>  <div> Other Versions and Sequels : Chrono Trigger takes place in the kingdom of Guardia throughout several different ages, primarily 1000 AD. The game opens with Crono, the game's protagnist, waking up on the day of the Millennial Fair. At the fair, Crono meets Marle, a mysterious and bubbly girl who ends up being teleported to the past after a mishap with a time machine. Crono decides to travel back in time as well and try to save her.Crono quickly finds that he has been teleported to the year 400 AD. This is an era in which the kingdom of Guardia is at perpetual war with the forces of an evil and powerful sorcerer named Magus.Upon visiting Guardia Castle, he finds Marle posing as this era's queen, Queen Leene. Unfortunately, their reunion is short-lived, as Marle vanishes suddenly after revealing her identity. On the way out of the castle, Crono finds Lucca, the time machine's inventor and a close friend of Crono, who has also traveled to 400 AD to see how she can help. Lucca tells Crono how Marle is actually the princess in 1000 AD, and that Queen Leene is her ancestor. When the castle guards found Marle, they stopped the search for Leene, essentially guaranteeing her death and ending her line.Crono and Lucca venture to a cathedral inhabited by monsters disguised as nuns. There, they meet Frog (who is actually Glenn, a knight who Magus turned into an amphibian), and manage to save the real queen as well as the chancellor. This fixes the timeline, and Crono and Lucca return home with Marle using a new device created by Lucca, the ""gate key,"" which stabilizes temporal vortexes and allows the party to traverse time using pre-existing ""gates.""Back in 1000 AD, Crono decides to escort Marle back to the castle. There, Crono is put on trial for allegedly kidnapping the princess and attempting to usurp power from the throne. No matter what the player does at this point in the game, Crono is convicted and thrown into prison.The player can break out on their own or wait for the execution (in the latter case, Lucca saves Crono at the last moment). The duo battle their way out of the prison, meeting up with Marle, who decides to flee with them. The party finds a portal in Guardia Forest. Cornered, and despite Lucca's protests that they don't know where the gate leads, the group enters the portal.The party ends up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in 2300 AD, and quickly discover an information center which gives them the location of another gate. The archive also has visual record of ""AD 1999: The Day of Lavos."" The video shows a gigantic monster emerging from the ground and destroying the world.The party decides to change the future by defeating Lavos in their own time.In another building, the group discovers a broken robot. Lucca decides to repair it, and Marle and Crono name him Robo. He repays the group by escorting them to the gate, located in ""Proto Dome,"" and by helping the group fight off a group of defective robots bent on the destruction of humans.The gate in Proto Dome takes the party to a hub world known as the End of Time, occupied by Gaspar. Gaspar informs the group that all lost time travelers end up there. The party also meets Spekkio, Master of War, who teaches all the human characters magic.The party learns Magus tried to summon Lavos in 600 AD, but a legendary hero (supposedly Frog) stopped him. The legend says that he wielded a blade called the Masamune that they find broken. The only smith who could fix such a blade would be Melchior, an eccentric old man who lives outside a village of Mystics, the followers of Magus, in the year 1000 AD. After coming to him with the sword, he tells them that he needs a substance known as Dreamstone to repair it, and that such a rare stone only comes from millions of years in the past.The group travels to 65,000,000 BC, where they meet Ayla, a prehistoric human who saves the group from a group of hostile reptiles known as Reptites. Ayla agrees to give Crono a Dreamstone if he can beat her in a drinking contest. Crono wins the contest, and they all pass out. When they wake up, their gate key is gone, stolen by Ayla's jealous friend Kino. The party navigates through a jungle maze to get the key back, ultimately encountering (and chasing away) Azala, the ruler of the Reptites. During this encounter, the party learns about the advanced intelligence of the Reptites, compared to the still-primitive, barbaric human race.They travel back to 1000 AD, and visit Melchior, who willingly repairs the Masamune. Crono and company then go back to 600 AD to find Frog, who believes he is unworthy to wield the legendary blade. After some convincing, he agrees, even traveling to the End of Time to learn magic. The party enters Magus' lair, and encounter his three generals: Ozzie (the Trickster General), Flea (the transgendered magician), and Slash (the inhumanly quick swordsman extraordinaire), all of whom the party handily defeats.They then face off with Magus, who they believe is in the process of creating Lavos with a powerful spell. Magus recognizes Frog but shows no fear in the face of the Masamune. The party defeats the sorcerer, causing his spell to go awry--Magus then reveals that he was not creating Lavos but merely summoning it so that he could defeat it. The incident causes a massive time gate that sucks the party into 65,000,000 BC.Here, they meet up with Ayla again, and decide to help her destroy the Reptites, ending the war between them and the humans. After reaching the top of the fortress, it turns out Azala is waiting for an omen that will supposedly bring victory to the Reptite horde. The party is forced to battle Azala and her pet, a massive black tyrannosaurus rex. The group is victorious, and the omen turns out to be Lavos falling to the earth from space. Only Azala recognizes it for what it is: the end of the future.Crono and friends then travel to a huge kingdom of magic in 12,000 BC. The Kingdom of Zeal is a huge floating continent where humans practice magic, a long-lost technique by the time Frog's era comes around. The people of Zeal are getting all their power through the Mammon Machine, a machine that extracts Lavos' energy for their own good. While exploring Zeal, the party meets a mysterious prophet, who warns Queen Zeal about Crono's plans. A young boy also tells the party, ""One among you will shortly perish.""The queen exiles the party to the ground of the world, which is experiencing an Ice Age brought on by Lavos' crash-landing so many years ago. When the group finally gets back to the End of Time, the old man tells them of a machine called the Wings of Time. They journey back to 2300 AD and find the device, a large flying machine which they christen Epoch.The party travels back to Zeal intent on destroying the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace. They arrive too late, however, and Lavos then awakens. The prophet is revealed to be Magus, who attempts to destroy Lavos but is batted aside effortlessly. Lavos stuns everyone, but Crono pulls himself to his feet. He hurls himself at Lavos, but is instantly vaporized. The rest of the party wakes up in a hut on the ground of the world, which is where non-magic users have lived. During the confusion, an advisor to Queen Zeal named Dalton has stolen the Wings of Time (now the ""Aero Dalton Imperial""), and has declared himself ruler of the world.When Frog wakes up, he goes outside and confronts Magus, who cursed him in the first place. Magus, for his part, is cocky, even insulting Crono and calling him weak for trying to stop Lavos. The player is given a choice: let Magus live or kill him and break the curse on Frog. If the player lets him live, he joins the party. The party goes to defeat Dalton, who imprisons them and requires a daring break-out, before being easily defeated. At the end of time, it is revealed that Magus was the mysterious prophet, and he only wanted to summon Lavos to kill it. It is revealed that the old man is a Guru named Gaspar. He informs the party of an egg called the Chrono Trigger, which they can use to resurrect Crono.At this point in the game, it is up to the player to save Crono or not. The main story is technically over aside from the final confrontation, a series of optional side quests open up, and resurrecting Crono is optional.If the player decides to revive Crono, Gaspar suggests that they visit Belthasar in 2300 AD. He knows the secret to bringing someone back from the dead. Belthasar tells them that Death Peak (also located in 2300 AD) is the key to reviving their downed comrade. However, there are two requirements: the need for Crono needs to be incredibly great and they will need an exact replica of him (which can be obtained from a magician in 1000 AD). After getting the replica, and visiting the top of Death Peak, Crono can be revived.Naturally, only one ending is considered canon. In this ending, the party reaches Lavos and manages to destroy its outer protective shell (either through fighting or crashing Epoch into it). Here, it is revealed that Lavos has been using the planet by harvesting DNA to control its evolution. It then proceeds to take on a final form, which is quickly destroyed by the team.The game then goes to a celebratory traditional ending at the end of the Millennial Fair. Crono and his friends all say goodbye and return to their respective eras via the time gates. If the player has Magus at this point, he leaves to search for his long-lost sister Schala. Depending on what the player did to penetrate Lavos' outer shell, Crono's mom either jumps into the time gate by accident (prompting the remaining party to go search for her) or Marle assists her father in hanging up Nadia's bell and accidentally getting carried away by some balloons (although she is saved by Crono). </div>  <div> Fan Remakes, Rom Hacks, and Rereleases : There are a total of twelve endings in the original release of Chrono Trigger, with an extra variant for the last two endings, adding up to a technical total of fourteen. The PlayStation re-release added an extra two animated endings, bringing the total to sixteen. The DS re-release then added another extra ending, bringing the new total to seventeen endings. </div> "

Civilization II,Alpha Unit,"Human EntertainmentJP, ActivisionPAL,NA","December 31, 1998",ps,The second game in the famous turn based strategy series by Sid Meier.,3030-217,217,0,1996-02-29,https://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-ii/3030-217/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Sid Meier's Civilization II is a PC turn based strategy game released in 1996. The game was met with critical and commercial success and is considered by many publications (such as IGN) to be one of the greatest games of all time. The object of the game is to create a civilization that can stand the test of time. Expand, conquer, trade and spread your culture around the world with the ultimate goal of either conquering all other nations or being the first nation to colonize another world.Although the title bears his name, Sid Meier actually had little to do with creating Civilization II. The game was designed by Brian Reynolds, Jeff Briggs and Douglas Caspian-Kaufman. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Civilization II is a turn based strategy game. Each game starts off on a randomly generated map in the year 4,000 B.C. The player is given one settler unit which can be used to build cities. Cities in turn can be used to bolster scientific development, generate tax income, and produce units such as more settlers, military units, and trade units. The game puts over 50 military units at a players disposal. Once a player has moved all of his / her units, the players turn ends, time progresses and other nations take their turns.Making a civilization.As a game of Civilization II progresses, the player will discover more and more technologies, build more and more cities as well as explore more of the map. As a player explores more of the map, he or she will encounterbarbarians as well as other Civilizations vying for dominance in the world. An interesting aspect about the Civilization series is that a player can choose to play the game peacefully, one does not need to be a warmonger in order to be successful. Players can sign cease fires, peace treaties, alliances and share technology / military units with other nations. If a player is being particularly aggressive, his reputation will take a hit and other nations will react accordingly. </div>  <div> Community : There are seven government types a player can choose from, with each government offering numerous advantages / disadvantages. Much of the following is taken from the ingame Civiliopedia:Despotism: A despotism is a government in which the ruler has absolute power, usually enforced by the military. In Civilization II, Despotism is the default government, it is usually best to change government types to Monarchy as soon as possible.Overview of the city.Each unit above the city size costs one Shield per turn.Settlers eat one Food per turn.Up to three military units in each city institute ""martial law"". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.Despotism has a high rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.Under a Despotism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 60%.Any terrain square that ordinarily produces three or more of any resource (Food, Shields, or Trade) produces one less.Because of Despotism's high rate of corruption, it is almost always an inferior form of government. Try to switch to a Monarchy as soon as possible.Monarchy: A Monarchy is a government ruled by a King or Queen. In Civilization II, a Monarchy is a good government to have for a small, new civilization.Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.Settlers eat one Food per turn.Up to three military units in each city institute ""martial law"". Each of these units makes one unhappy citizen content.Monarchy has a moderate rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.Under a Monarchy, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 70%.Monarchy is an excellent form of government for a young civilization.Fundamentalism: Fundamentalism is a form of government centered around a certain set of beliefs, usually religious. In real life, this would be akin to a theocracy. In Civilization II, Fundamentalism is a good government to have if one goes on the war path.Each unit beyond the tenth unit costs one Shield per turn (except Fanatics, which never require maintenance).Settlers eat two Food per turn.Under Fundamentalism, no citizen is ever unhappy.Fundamentalism has a very low rate of corruption.Under Fundamentalism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.Under Fundamentalism, all Science production is HALVED.Improvements that normally convert unhappy citizens to content citizens produce ""tithes"" (money) equivalent to the number of people they would normally convert, and require no maintenance.The diplomatic penalties for terrorist acts committed by Diplomats and Spies is reduced.Fundamentalism eliminates all happiness problems and provides excellent revenue, although research tends to languish.Republic: A Republic is an assembly of autonomous city-states under the control of a central government. Although the central government has the ultimate say in matters that affect the society as a whole, the city-states are given a certain amount of latitude in the governing of local affairs. In Civilization II, a Republic is a good government for scientific advancement and is usually a good fit for a medium sized empire to have.Each unit costs one shield per turn.Settlers eat two Food per turn.Each unit beyond the first unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes one citizen in its home city to become unhappy.Republics experience a low rate of corruption and waste. The farther a city is from your capital, the higher its level of corruption.Under a Republic, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.Switching to a Republic can give an astounding boost to your Science and Luxury revenues, although you will probably be forced to shift some Trade to Luxuries in order to prevent unhappiness.Republics make it difficult and expensive to keep a sizable army in the field, but building certain Improvements and Wonders can help to alleviate this problem.Communism: In a true Communist system, all property is owned collectively by the people, and labor is organized to be equally advantageous to all people. In Civilization II, Communism is a good government to have a nation on the warpath.Each unit beyond the third unit costs one Shield per turn.Settlers eat one Food per turn.Up to three military units in each city institute ""martial law"". Each of these units makes two unhappy citizens content.Under Communism, state control of the economy eliminates organized crime. Your cities, therefore, experience no corruption.All Spy units produced under Communist governments are Veterans.Under Communism, Tax/Luxury/Science rates cannot be set higher than 80%.Communism is best for large, far-flung empires that need to maintain a large military.Use your powerful Spies to steal technology from the capitalist pigs!Democracy: A Democracy is ruled by a president elected by the people. In Civilization II, Democracies are great for peaceful empires who wish to pursue research and generate money.Each unit costs one shield per turn.Settlers eat two Food per turn.Each unit that is not in a friendly city (or in a Fortress within three squares of a friendly city) causes two citizens in its home city to become unhappy.Democracies experience no corruption or waste.Tax/Luxury/Science rates can be set to any level desired.Under a Democracy, each square that ordinarily produces at least one unit of Trade produces an extra unit of Trade.The units and cities of a Democracy are immune to bribery in any form.Your senate may force a peaceful solution in a conflict.Democracies can produce spectacular amounts of revenue and scientific research. However, because of the severe happiness restrictions on military units, this form of government tends to be viable only for large, advanced civilizations.Increasing your Luxury rate and building Improvements and Wonders can help alleviate unhappiness.Anarchy: Anarchy is a lack of government, and occurs in Civilization II when a nation is switching from one government type to another. Under Anarchy, many cities become unhappy and no money or scientific research is generated.Civilization II also features live action actors that serve as a council of advisers. The council will comment on how you're doing and fight with one another on what matters are more important for your empire. </div>  <div> Expansion Packs and special editions : There are 21 playable Civilizations in Civ 2. The following is a list of playable Civilizations and their ingame colorWhite: Romans, Russian, Celts.Green: Babylonians, Zulus, Japanese.Blue: Germans, French, Vikings.Yellow: Egyptians, Aztecs, Spanish.Teal: Americans, Chinese, Persians.Orange: Greeks, English, Carthaginians.Purple: Indians, Mongols, Sioux.Red: Barbarians.Civilizations who are the same color cannot appear together in the same game. For example, the Romans and Russians cannot appear together because both are the color white. A little known fact is that the color of your civilization determines in what order your starting location is picked as well as how much you are handicapped in scientific research. The white civilization gets their starting location picked first, the green second, so and and so forth. Because the purple civilization has its location is picked last, every civilizations scientific advancement is either helped or hindered depending on how many more or less technologies one has when compared to the purple Civilization. For example, if the Romans have 10 more technologies when compared to the Indians, the Romans will research at a slower pace then they would normally. The purple civilization will always research at a normal rate. This is why if one plans on being a technologically advanced nation, it is best to pick one of the purple Civilizations. </div>  <div> Console Releases : The Civilization series has a strong online community. Players have come up with a number of ways to keep the game interesting, such as succession games (one player plays for a set number of turns, passes it onto someone else to play for a set number of turns, etc.), GOTM (game of the month; One of the big fansites creates a scenario every month for people to play, allowing players to directly compete and compare their results to one another). While the focus of this community tends to shift towards the newer releases in the franchise, particuaraly Civilization IV, there is still an active GOTM for Civilization II. There is also a large number of guides and strategies to be found on community fansites, as well as mods and scenarios.The two main fansites for all things Civilization:www.civfanatics.comwww.apolyton.com </div> "

ASCII Entertainment released Clock Tower in North America a year later in 1997 and in Europe in 1998. </div>  <div> Story : Clock Tower takes place one year after the events of The First Fear. Jennifer Simpson has been adopted by Helen Maxwell and is receiving psychological treatment in Oslo, the capital of Norway, because of the horrors she experienced in the first game. The rest of Clock Tower's plot revolves around the mysteries of another survivor from the first game named Edward and the re-emergence of the Scissor Man.There are 10 different endings in Clock Tower, 5 for Jennifer and 5 for Helen. The player's actions and the character he/she is playing as in the final scenario, decides which ending the player will receive. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Clock Tower uses a Point and Click system that is found in many games of its era and genre. The user interface for Clock Tower was simplified from the original Super Famicom game, Clock Tower: The First Fear, in order to have better interaction in the game. One aspect of Clock Tower's plot that affects overall gameplay is the main antagonist, Scissor Man, who appears randomly and chases the player throughout the game. The player will have to hide, find objects, and solve puzzles in order to protect his/herself from Scissor Man. If Scissor Man attacks the player, the character will enter panic mode, in which he/she must mash the panic button in order to escape, with failure to do so (or low health) leading to a game over.The player controls a different character in each of Clock Tower's three separate scenarios. Samuel Barton is controlled in the prologue, Jennifer or Helen Maxwell in the first scenario, and either Nolan, Stan, or Helen in the final scenario. Between each scenario the player can explore a world map and gather clues in the town before going to the next level. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Jennifer Simpson: The main character from the first Clock Tower game.Samuel Barton: A professor of criminal psychology that is investigating the Clock Tower Case.Helen Maxwell: Samuel Barton's assistant, who is also curious about the Clock Tower Case.Nolan Campbell: A tabloid newspaper reporter.Stan Gotts: An assistant-inspector who is investigating the Clock Tower Case with the police. </div>  <div> Trivia : ASCII Grip VClock Tower uses the ASCII Grip V, a one-handed Playstation controller used mainly for point and click RPG's. The controller features all of the buttons present on a normal Playstation controller and looks similar to the Wii's Nunchuck.The character Jennifer Simpson is actually modeled after famed actress Jennifer Connelly. </div> "

The Struggle Within is the first entry in the series to not feature Jennifer Simpson as a main character and instead follows a 16 year-old Alyssa Hale as she finds her relatives falling under the curse of the Maxwell Family. The game was developed by Human Entertainment for the PlayStation and was released in Japan on March 12, 1998 followed a year later by Agetec's North American release on October 31, 199. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Alyssa being attacked!The gameplay in Clock Tower 2 is similar to the first games, with a slightly heavier emphasis on puzzles and item collecting. The game still uses a point and click interface, with the inventory on the top of the screen. This time, you're being hunted by more than one crazy murderer: a psychotic zombified girl named Stephanie, her zombified brother, Michael, and various other psychos and zombies.Most of the game still consists of running through a house, evading mostly invulnerable enemies by hiding under or in furniture, or using your environment against them. This time, however, you share your body with Bates, your alternate personality. Bates is a tough guy, and, unlike Alyssa, he can use guns, which are placed sparingly throughout the game and allow you to get rid of an enemy easily.Alyssa can switch personalities with Bates by dropping her amulet somewhere (picking it up will turn you back to Alyssa). Bates and Alyssa will trigger different events in the story and can pick up or use different items. This element is important, because the game has a staggering 13 different endings. Seemingly inconsequential actions can largely affect the ending. </div>  <div> Characters : Alyssa Hale: Alyssa is the main character in Clock Tower 2. She is a 17 year old school girl who has been having dark visions of murder. Alyssa's father was never around much, but when she was young he gave her an amulet. The game opens as Alyssa is heading to her uncle's house.Bates (Mr. Bates): Alyssa's alter-ego. He is cold blooded and ruthless, the dark side of Alyssa. He is only able to take control of their body when Alyssa is not holding her amulet. He is shown to be very protective of Alyssa, usually not coming out unless she is in danger, even without the amulet.Philip Tate: Alyssa's uncle. He is the director of the Memorial Pharmaceuticals Research Lab. The first scenario of the game takes place in his home.Allen Hale: Alyssa's father. He worked with Philip at the Memorial Pharmaceuticals Research Lab, until George Maxwell appeared and took his position.Alex Corey: A detective who never does much. He is a snob, and only appears when the timing suits him, usually at the end of scenarios.Shannon Lewis: Allen Hale's other daughter. When her parents divorced, her mother took full custody of her. Her mother soon died of illness, and Shannon was raised by relatives. She grows to hate her father Allen, and Alyssa.George Maxwell: The oldest son of the Maxwell family.

One of the primary complaints from reviewers was the claustrophobic environments and awkward camera angles due to the game taking place (almost entirely) on a train. </div>  <div> Story : In Eastern Europe, a terrorist group known as the ""Knights of the Apocalypse"" successfully breach security and board the NATO armored train, Blue Harvest, somewhere on the outskirts of St. Petersburg. Amongst those on board is the French Ambassador to Russia, Pierre Simon, his 45-year-old wife Catherine, and his 11-year-old daughter, Jane. Boris Zugoski, former KGB agent and leader of the terrorists, demands 20 billion US dollars and safe passage into France in exchange for the lives of the Simon family. The presence of a nuclear bomb on board the train also presents a great risk. A rescue team is dispatched to the location of the captured train with the hope that the hostages can be extracted.Lieutenant Jack Morton, a U.S. Air Force helicopter pilot, is a member of a multi-national NATO escort assigned to the Blue Harvest, and becomes the only NATO survivor who can mount an effective resistance. The assault consists of an ambush by four missile-armed helicopters that suddenly destroy the friendly air assets escorting the Blue Harvest out of Russia. The first stage of the assault is immediately followed by the detonation of at least one remote-controlled bomb planted on the train, and then by a boarding action with a well-equipped assault team of several dozen men carried by the four attacking helicopters -- which descend low enough that the assault team merely jumps, without using ropes. Lt. Morton, however, also manages to jump from his helicopter as it is being destroyed. Hanging from the side of the train, he conceals himself until the initial attack is over, then he sneaks inside the train without being seen. Upon radioing headquarters, he is briefed on the situation and is given his orders: to locate and protect the Ambassador and his family until help arrives. The game does feature some player decision making and multiple endings based on performance at various points through out the game. </div>  <div> Chapter & Location Listing : St. Petersburgh - RussiaNovgorod - RussiaMinsk - BelarusWarsaw / Lubland - PolandPoznan - PolandBerlin / Leipzig - GermanyStuttgart - GermanyZurich - SwitzerlandGeneva - SwitzerlandLyon - France </div>  <div> Characters : Jack Morton - Main character, Jack Morton is a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.Christina Wayborn - Wayborn is in charge of the guards assigned to the French Ambassador.Billy Macguire - French Army officer in charge of the Blue Harvest's radar system.Pierre Simon - The French ambassador to Russia, performing the last duties for his job by riding on the Blue Harvest.Catherine Simon & Jane Simon - The wife and daughter of French Ambassador Pierre Simon who are held captive with him on the Blue Harvest.Philip Mason - The French Ambassador's secretary </div>  <div> Villains & Bosses : Boris Zugoski - The primary villain in the game, Zugoski is the leader of the terrorist group known as ""Knights of the Apocalypse""Andrei MikhalkovVincent RossaNikita Andropov </div>  <div> Weapons : FistsBlack Panther 9mm Handgun (Dual Wielding available)M-75 Guardian 9mm Machine Gun50550 5.6mm Assault RifleHand GrenadesPlastic Explosives </div>  <div> Multiple Endings : Covert Ops Nuclear Dawn features multiple endings for your character based not on your performance in the game, but decisions you make as well. </div> "

If the player completes a level with all crates smashed and without losing a life, they are awarded with a Gem. Also if the player completes the level in the time trial they get another Gem for completing it under a certain time. </div>  <div> Story : Crash Bandicoot is kidnapped by the evil Dr. Neo Cortex who has the intent of transforming the poor marsupial into an ultimate warrior for his army of super animal soldiers. This army was created, according to the games manual, to get back at those who made fun of Cortex in the past. Crash is disregarded as another failed attempt and manages to escape Cortex's clutches by jumping out of the window of Cortex Castle. As Crash Jumps Cortex's minions prepare Tawna Bandicoot, believed to be Crash's girlfriend, for experimentation. Crash washes up on the shore of N Sanity beach and must fight his way through three Islands in order to save Tawna from Cortex. Along the way Crash faces an array of bosses including the enraged Papu Papu and a host of Cortex's failed experiments including; Ripper Roo, Koala Kong and Pinstripe Potroo. As Crash nears Cortex Castle he faces Dr. N.Brio, Cortex's right hand man, and finally Cortex himself atop Cortex's blimp. As Cortex castle burns, Crash beats Cortex and he falls to his supposed demise. In the last shot of the game we see Crash and Tawna flying off into the sunset on a bird. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game has twenty-five normal platform levels, as well as two secret levels and six boss battles. The player must make their way through a limited environment whilst defeating enemies, avoiding pits and breaking crates, each of which contain some kind of bonus. Crash's only forms of attack are jumping and spinning. The majority of enemies can be defeated by using the jump attack, but enemies that cannot be defeated by the jump attack must be defeated by using the spinning move. This move can also be used to hit enemies into other enemies or crates. In some levels, Crash will ride a hog, which he has limited control over. In levels such as these, the player must avoid obstacles such as enemies while continuously going forward at fast speed on the hog. Some levels have the player being chased by a boulder, in which Bandicoot must run towards the screen while jumping over gaps. </div>  <div> Items : The player can collect masks called Aku Aku. They help protect Crash against enemy attacks, collecting three of them gives temporary invulnerability. </div>  <div> Structure : The player can obtain icons in crates that depict Crash's face, these give him an extra life. Lives are more like a stock in that when Crash has one life left it means he has one extra go left, if you are at zero lives and die you will be taken to the game over screen </div>  <div> The First Island : These icons depict faces of Tawna, Cortex and Brio. If crash collects three matching icons in a level he is taken to a bonus stage. </div>  <div> The Second Island : Wumpa fruit are found throughout the adventure in crates, if Crash obtains 100 Wumpa fruit he is rewarded with an extra life and his Wumpa counter returns to zero. </div>  <div> The Third Island : Crash Bandicoot's journey is split into three large sections with roughly a third of the game happening on one of three Islands known loosely as the Wumpa Islands, named after the fruit that crash collects on his journey. The islands are sometimes known as N.Sanity Islands however this is more referential to the first of the three. The game never specifies where these islands are situated exactly with some reference to Australia and others to South America due to the Mayan ruins found littered on the islands. </div>  <div> Secrets : The First Island consists of a Native homeland, well away from the industrious Cortex, yet crash still faces challenges thrown at him by nature and angry tribesmen. </div>  <div> Development : N.Sanity Beach - Shows the basics of the game, Crash must fight crabs and turtles on his way into the Island.Jungle Rollers - Begins to ramp up the difficulty with moving obstacles, living plants and skunks.The Great Gate - Introduces a side scrolling style of platforming up a large Native wall, crash must avoid natives and monkeys as he travels.Boulders - The first level with the now trademark running from Boulder Crash Bandicoot level The camera is in front of Crash instead of behind so fast reactions are needed.Upstream - A level where there is no solid ground, if crash falls in the water he loses a life.Papu Papu - Boss, see below.Rolling Stones - A more complex level based off Jungle Rollers.Hog Wild - The first in another famous style of Crash level, Crash rides a boar who never stops so all crash can do is steer left and right throughout the level.Native Fortress - A more complex level in the style of The Great Gate. </div>  <div> Reception : Papu PapuPapu Papu is the first boss in the game and therefore he is fairly easy to beat requiring only three hits. Papu Papu is not one of Cortex's animal warriors but is instead a rather territorial Chieftain of the Native N.Sanity Island tribe. He is an overweight human who's bad back leads to his downfall.

It features similar gameplay, with improvements such as the ability to double jump, slide, and body slam. The game was also the first to use the warp room section, in which the player was given a choice of five levels to play, in any order they wished, until all were complete. The player then had to face a boss in order to continue. It was released on Halloween 1997. </div>  <div> Story : Cortex Plotting his planAfter the events of the normal ending of Crash Bandicoot,  Cortex finds himself in a dark, dusty room. Upon lighting a match, he discovers a Master Crystal, which sets a new evil plot in his mind. Two years after this, Cortex consults his new right hand man,  Dr N.Gin on the matter. N.Gin states that the Master Crystal is not nearly enough for their plan, and that they are going to need the twenty five Slave Crystals as well. Cortex acknowledges that there are no friends left on earth to aid them, so an enemy is needed.On an errand to get some batteries for his sister's laptop, Crash is abducted by Cortex, who tells Crash that he is a changed man in dire need of the bandicoot's assistance. Cortex gets Crash to recover all twenty five Slave Crystals, whilst tricking him that it's for the good of the planet. Crash's sister,  Coco, and Cortex's ex-right hand man,  N. Brio, realize that Cortex wants the Crystals to power a new Cortex Vortex, to achieve world domination. Coco and N. Brio try to warn Crash, who finds out just in time. With all twenty five Crystals in his possession, Crash confronts and beats Cortex once again. If the player has also obtained all of the Gems in the game, a bonus ending will play, where N. Brio uses the gems' power to destroy the Cortex Vortex for good. We see from the beginning of  Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, that this ending is the canonical one. </div>  <div> Gameplay : While the core gameplay of platforming and smashing boxes remains the same, some drastic changes were brought into Crash 2, and they would become staples for the franchise. The most significant is the warp room system, which eradicated the map screen from the first game. When Crash is abducted, he is thrust into a warp room, in which the player can choose to play 5 levels in any order. If the player collects the crystal from each one, they are able to proceed to the next warp room after a boss fight. Some old faces return, such as Ripper Roo, and some new ones are added, such as Komodo Joe and Moe, as well as  Tiny the tiger. After the game is completed, the player can revisit the levels and attempt to obtain all gems and gain the elusive 100%. </div>  <div> New Items : In each level, there is a bonus round. Crash does not lose lives when doing these and, unlike the first game, can repeat them as many times as the player wishes, as long as they do not finish them. Most bonus rounds involve the player having to think about how they will get all the boxes for the gem. </div>  <div> Structure : As well as the returning items such as Wumpa Fruit and  Aku Aku, Crash Bandicoot 2 added a couple of extras to enhance gameplay. These are: </div>  <div> The First Warp Room : Nitro CrateLike the  TNT crate; however, this item would explode on impact, even if it were only touched by Crash. A green exclamation mark box will explode all nitro crates in the level, so getting the level's gem was still possible. </div>  <div> The Second Warp Room : In the original Crash Bandicoot, the way the player would progress through the levels would be completely linear. In Crash Bandicoot 2, however, Crash was given five levels at a time to tackle, in what ever order the player wished. To signify that a level was complete, the player would bring a crystal back from it, which was always placed rather blatantly in the level. If the player dodged the crystal, but made it through the level, then the level was still regarded as incomplete.

Crash Bandicoot: Warped,Naughty Dog,"SCEEPAL, SCEAUS","November 15, 1998",ps,A direct sequel to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. Crash and Coco Bandicoot have to travel through time to collect crystals before Doctor Neo Cortex and his allies do. This was the last platforming Bandicoot game by Naughty Dog.,3030-12909,12909,0,1998-10-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/crash-bandicoot-warped/3030-12909/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is a platformer developed by Naughty Dog for the original Sony PlayStation. The game is a sequel to the previous entry in the franchise, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. It was the last platformer developed by Naughty Dog for this franchise, who then went on to make the successful Crash Team Racing which would become the last Crash title developed by them.The story centers on Crash and his sister Coco Bandicoot and their ongoing goal to gather pink crystals, that have been scattered across time, before their enemies can do the same. There are sections in which the player plays as Crash, while in other sections the player controls Coco. Warped was the first Crash Bandicoot game to feature a demo of Insomniac Games' highly successful Spyro The Dragon. These demos would last until until a later entry in the Crash franchise, Crash Bash, was released. </div>  <div> Story : At the end of Crash Bandicoot 2 Cortex's Vortex was destroyed and it's pieces fell down to earth. One of those pieces hit an ancient temple located on Cortex's island. This freed the ancient mask known as Uka Uka, Aku Aku's evil brother. We find out that Uka Uka had been commanding Cortex from inside his temple prison and is now angry about the way the past two endeavours have gone. Uka Uka tells Cortex that there are still crystals left, all scattered across time, The two get the help of Dr.N.Trophy to build a time machine and send their minions on a mission to get the crystals. back on N.Sanity Island, Aku Aku senses something wrong and finds the warp rooms so Crash and Coco can stop Cortex and Uka Uka's new plot. After Collecting all of the Crystals, Gems and relics, Crash faces Cortex and Uka Uka for a final time. The Time rift sends Cortex, Uka Uka and N. Trophy through a time rift where they discover that they have turned into babies. If not the two get trapped in a hole after the last fight. Whilst the former ending is the 100% ending, there is speculation whether it is canonical or not if we regard the next game in the series, Crash Team Racing, to be canonical as Cortex, Uka Uka and N.Trophy make an appearance. </div>  <div> New Items : A Sapphire Time RelicAs well as a Crystal and a Gem, levels now had relics. Once the crystal was acquired in a level and Crash went back in a clock was available at the start if Crash hit the clock a timer would start and a time trial began. If crash could beat a time a relic would be unlocked. Whilst the game would accept any relic for the game's full ending, there were three kinds, each depending on the player's time. The three relics were normal, gold, and platinum. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A new crate that switches its contents depending on when it is it. The change of contents would continually become faster; if players did not break the box in time it would turn to steel, meaning the player can not obtain the level's gem. </div>  <div> Structure : Crash 3 world mapCrash Bandicoot Warped follows a very similar style to its two predecessors, Crash has to jump and spin his way through a series of levels and boss fights to complete the game, smashing all boxes in the level to obtain a gem. The game was most like Crash Bandicoot 2 in that Crash had to find a Crystal in each level to complete it. Like in Crash Bandicoot 2, Crash would gain a new skill after fighting every boss, such as a double jump or a body slam. Crash Bandicoot: Warped had the most varied gameplay of the series with new levels such as Jet ski challenges, motorbike races, and airplane fights. Coco is playable in the game, however she was always riding a tiger, in a jet ski, or in a plane. Bonus levels worked the same way that they did in Crash Bandicoot 2, giving puzzles to those that wished to obtain the gem. Crash Bandicoot: Warped was the first Crash game not to be set on the three islands alone, Crash would visit a number of locations on the globe spanning millions of years of history in order to get the crystals. The image below shows some of those locations. </div>  <div> Reception : Crash Bandicoot: Warped has a similar structure to Crash Bandicoot 2, the player is given levels in sets of five through five warp rooms - also known as time travel areas in this game. The player can tackle these levels in any order. Once the Crystal has been unlocked in all five levels, a boss fight is unlocked and needs to be beaten in order to progress to the next set of levels. The Warp Rooms aren't in scattered locations like in the second game but were all branching off one main hub. </div> "

They are all shocked to see themselves gathered in one area, friend and foe alike. Before they have a chance to start attacking each other, a giant screen lights up in front of them, an alien by the name of Nitros Oxide declares that he wants to race the best driver in this world and that if he, Nitros Oxide, wins he will turn the world into a giant parking lot. He says that he doesn't know who the best racer in the land is so he wants everyone to race against each other and he will challenge the winner. Once the player collects of all the Time Relics, CTR Tokens and Crystals, Oxide admits defeat and returns to his home planet. </div>  <div> Adventure : Adventure mode is the single-player story mode of the game. At the beginning the player chooses one character from the roster and enters an open-world environment. From here the player can access races through warp zones similar to those seen in Crash Bandicoot 3. After the player has finished first in a race they can either go and play unlocked levels or complete Time Trial races or CTR races. Time Trial has the player attempt three laps round the track in a short specific time, the only way to achieve these is to master the quickest paths and smash time crates which stop the counter. In CTR races the player has to collect CTR tokens scattered around the level whilst still completing the race in first place. Finally the other way to get CTR tokens in through challenges in Adventure, the player must speed around the battle levels and collect crystals under a certain time limit. Completing races continues the plot of the game and unlocks more races and environments. After a set amount of races have been completed Boss Races become available from famous bosses in the Crash franchise. Once beaten the Bosses open new environments for the player with new warp zones and challenges. While the player does not need to complete Time Trials and CTR token races they are used to unlock additional characters later in the game. </div>  <div> Characters : The game in actionThe following are the boss racers the player will encounter in the Adventure Mode;Ripper RooPapu PapuKomodo JoePinstripeNitrous Oxide </div>  <div> Power-Ups : The game is spilt up into different five different areas where races are unlocked and played:N.Sanity BeachCrash Cove, Roo's Tubes, Mystery Caves and Sewer Speedway.The Lost RuinsCoco Park, Tiger Temple, Papu's Pyramid and Dingo Canyon.Glacier ParkBlizzard Bluff, Dragon Mines, Polar Pass and Tiny Arena.The CitadelN.

Crates marked with a question mark will give the player character a random power-up and spring box crates will give them wumpa fruit.Wumpa fruitWumpa Fruit - When 10 wumpa fruit are collected two things will happen. The player will get an increase in their top speed and it will modify any power-ups to make them stronger e.g. A TNT crate will become a Nitro crate. The player can collect wumpa fruit by smashing spring box crates and also pick up loose wumpa fruit scattered around the track. If the player has wumpa fruit and are hit by an enemy racer or if they fall off the track the number of wumpa fruit they have will decrease.Uka Uka/Aku Aku - The Voodoo mask provides three different effects to the player for a limited time. A mask will spin around the player and they will receive a noticeable increase in speed, invulnerability to other racer's power ups and the player can also hit other racers to cause them to spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer. Good characters will receive the Aku Aku mask and bad characters will get the Uka Uka mask, there is no gameplay difference between the masks.Green and Red Bottles - Green bottles can be dropped behind the player or can be fired forward. If a racer hits a green bottle they will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a red bottle is obtained instead. The red bottle has a similar effect to the green bottle but it also forms a raincloud over the player that hits it. The player is slowed down and also loses the ability to hop. Red and green bottles can also be used to deflect incoming attacks.Homing Missiles - Homing missiles will lock on to the nearest racer in front when fired. They will follow racers until they hit their target but can be avoided by obstructing their path with track terrain or using a TNT/Nitro crate to destroy them. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause racers to spin out for longer. A triple version of this power up is also available where the racer gets three rockets instead of one from a single pick-up.TNT and Nitro Crates - A TNT crate can be dropped behind the player's cart to obstruct other racers. If a racer hits a TNT crate it will land on their head and countdown. The racer has three seconds to shake the TNT off before it explodes by hopping up and down. If caught in the TNT blast radius racers will spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit a TNT crate becomes a Nitro crate. Nitro crates have the same effect except they lack the delay and explode on contact. TNT/Nitro crates can be used to block incoming attacks.Bowling Balls - Bowling balls can be fired forwards or backwards. They travel in a straight line and explode on contact with either racers or terrain. They cause racers to spin out when hit and they can also be detonated by pressing circle again after they have been released. When upgraded by wumpa fruit they cause the racer to spin out for longer. A triple power up is also available where the racer gets three bowling balls instead of one.Warp Orb - Once it has been fired, a warp orb will travel the course ahead of the player's cart and make anyone in the vicinity spin out. When upgraded by wumpa fruit, it lasts longer.Green and Blue Shields - Green shields when activated will protect the player's cart from a single attack or will eventually fade away if they are not hit. The player can also fire the shield ahead of them like a bowling ball. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the shield turns blue and will last longer.Timer - When activated it will slow down all other racers to crawling speed for a short time. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the power up lasts longer.Turbo - A turbo will give the player a prolonged burst of speed like the boost gained from power sliding. When upgraded by wumpa fruit the boost lasts for longer. </div> "

As the only survivor and having witnessed the true face of the WEC, players join the Resistance.Crusader: No Remorse is an isometric action game developed by both Realtime Associates, Inc. and Origin Systems. The main designer was Tony Zurovec.The packaging for the game was notable for including a number of items created to enhance the player's immersion into the backstory regarding the world of Crusader. This was typical of many titles released for the the PC at the time, such as Maniac Mansion's inclusion of a mock-bulletin board poster or the newspaper that came with Alone in the Dark, before the practice became relegated to providing material for Collector's Editions.A manual titled ""Anti-Terrorist Site Security"" described the security features and enemies of the WEC within its fiction intended as an introduction for those working within the corporation. Another booklet, titled ""Resistance Confidential"", described the various weapons and dangers within the game from the rebel point of view. A newsletter was also included showing the news for the day, albeit from the WEC's perspective.The game was built with the same engine behind Ultima VIII, but was heavily modified for its debut as an action game.

The game was actually titled D's Dinner Table (""D no Shokutaku""), but was released in English regions simply as ""D"".Not only was D one of the company's first games, it was also the company's first game to be in the ""interactive fiction"" style that the company came to be known for. D was initially developed on only three Amiga computers. Most media and game players at the time considered the 3D visuals used in the game to be a miraculous feat, especially considering the small number of developers and computers used to create the game in its entirety.D was a breakthrough title for Warp, pushing the boundaries of video games, with first-person survival horror, FMV pre-rendered movement, puzzle-solving gameplay, a disturbing atmosphere, and taboo content such as violence and cannibalism. </div>  <div> Gameplay : D is an adventure game in which the player controlls main character Laura Harris, who must find out why her father has gone on a murderous rampage and is holding hostages in a hospital. The game uses pre-generated computer graphics and full motion video to tell its story. The player has two hours to solve the mystery of why Laura's father went on his bloody massacre. The player manipulates the Laura character from both a first person and third person perspectives.The game has several endings, a time's up ending, a good and bad ending, and a 100% completion ending. The ending a player witnessed was based on their actions throughout the game. The 100% complete ending includes the good ending and the addition of the sounds of a newborn baby crying. Some players inexplicably concluded that this sound of a baby crying meant that the visibly not pregnant Laura gave birth at the end of the game, a storyline development that some misguidedly believed would lead directly into the sequel, D2.The 3DO ConsoleD was originally released on the 3DO console and was later ported to the Playstation, Sega Saturn and PC by Acclaim. The game had a very high sell through rate on all those consoles except for the Playstation. The game was considered a sensational hit in Japan.It is rumored that the Playstation game received the most pre-orders, but Sony failed to produce enough copies of the game to meet the demand. Eno decided to sever all further ties with Sony for further WARP developed games. Eno said in an interview with 1UP.com in 2008 ""So the sales people had gotten 100,000 preorders from retailers, but Sony wasn't able to manufacture all of them. I was very pissed about that, because one title like that for a small company is very important. If that game doesn't sell well, then that's very bad for the company."" </div>  <div> Sequel : A rare glimpse of the original version of D2Main Article: D2The sequel to D, D2, was originally designed as a direct followup to D. Not only that, it would also be among the first games developed for the M2, 3DO's video game platform designed to follow up on the original 3DO and to be manufactured by Panasonic.Because the M2 was cancelled by Panasonic and never came to fruition, the original design for D2 was also cancelled. The original M2 design of the game had it set years after D, and begin as Laura Harris's unborn child is stolen from her by otherworldly power. The child is then miraculously aged and transported back in time to a medieval castle that the player, as the child, must escape from. Some believe that this game as originally intended was more directly related to the first game, it being related to the sounds of the newborn baby that were featured in one of the endings of the first game. The concept was dropped in the process of the game's redesign. </div> "

The story is that the series' main protagonist, the vampire Demitri Maximoff, is holding a tournament on Earth to see which of the creatures of the night (the ""darkstalkers"") is worthy to rule the Demon World.The gameplay builds upon the fighting mechanics of Super Street Fighter II Turbo, adding new gameplay mechanics to the genre (such as enhanced versions of special moves, the ability to block while in the air, and pre-determined combos of normal moves). The series's quick gameplay, as well as its unique character art style (where sprites are less defined and more cartoony), served as the inspiration for other Capcom games of the mid-to-late 90s (including the Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel vs. Capcom series).Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors later received a port to the PlayStation on March 28, 1996 (as Capcom's first PS1 release, which was later digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, both by PlayStation Network, on November 29, 2011). It was also included in the Japan-exclusive PlayStation 2 compilation Vampire: Darkstalkers Collection, released on May 19, 2005. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Lord Raptor Defeats MorriganThere are many refinements from Street Fighter II 's gameplay. These include air blocking, crouch walking, and chain combos.The game featured a special meter that could be filled to perform a powerful attack. If the player manages to fill the special meter all the way, the player gains access to more powerful special moves that would reset the special meter. Once filled however, the meter will begin decreasing down to zero only giving the player a limited amount of time to actually use any special moves that required the meter.Air blocking was a new feature for fighting games at the time, it allowed characters to jump without fear of being countered. This allowed the attacking player to put more pressure on less aggressive opposition.John Talbian Crouch WalkingCrouch walking was a new feature for Capcom fighting games. It allowed a crouching character to slowly move forward by having the player press down forward on the joystick. This in combination with air blocking made Darkstalkers a much more aggressive fighting game than street fighter II. Other than the Darkstalkers series, no other Capcom fighting games have made use of this mechanic.Chain combos where introduced in Darkstalkers. Also known as dial-a-combo, chain combos are a string of predetermined normal attacks that will link together. </div>  <div> Characters : Darkstalkers Character Select ScreenThe game features ten playable characters and two unplayable boss characters (fought as the two final opponents consecutively).The character roster of the game are based off of many fantasy horror archetypes, such as Frankenstein's monster, a Sasquatch, and a mummy in a sarcophagus. Like other fighting games of the time, the cast of characters all came from different parts of the world (as shown in the ""world map"" on the character selection screen). </div> "
Darkstalkers 3,Capcom,Capcom,"November 30, 1998",ps,The third (and final) major installment of Capcom's horror-themed fighting game series adds a variety of new characters and major gameplay changes (such as changing the round-based system to a lives-based system).,3030-1541,1541,0,1998-04-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/darkstalkers-3/3030-1541/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Vampire Savior: The Lord of Vampire (also known as Darkstalkers 3 and Vampire Savior: World of Darkness) is a 2D horror-themed fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on May 1997.The third installment of the Darkstalkers franchise (and the sequel to Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge), Vampire Savior further modifies the roster (replacing Donovan Baine, Huitzil, and Pyron with four new characters: young succubus Lilith, bee/human hybrid Q-Bee, schizophrenic psychopath B.B. Hood, and dark vampire savior Jedah Dohma). The story's main antagonist is Jedah, who is displeased with the state of the Demon World after being resurrected and decides to recreate it himself in his own dimension, feeding it with souls he deems worthy (which happen to include the Darkstalkers).The gameplay itself sees two major enhancements: the ""Damage Gauge System"" (which replaces the traditional round-based system, in which both player's lifebars are restored between rounds, with a lives-based system, and allows players to slowly regain a portion of their lifebar by avoiding further damage) and the ""Dark Force System"" (a manuever, activated by pressing a Punch and Kick button of the same strength simultaneously, that temporarily grants the player character special properties unique to that character). </div>  <div> Updates, Ports, and Re-releases : Two separate arrangements of Vampire Savior were released to Japanese arcades simultaneously on September 1997: Vampire Hunter 2: Darkstalkers Revenge and Vampire Savior 2: The Lord of Vampire. Both games feature minor gameplay adjustments (such as updated movelists, retweaking the power of the Dark Force mechanic, removing character-specific boss fights and endings, and recoloring stages and CPU opponents), and only differ from each other by their character roster. Both updates also add another secret character (Marionette), who takes control of a ""copy"" of the current opponent (creating mirror matches).Alongside these updates, the original game received three major ports:The first port was released, in Japan only, for the Saturn on April 16, 1998. This version adds the three removed characters back into the roster.An enhanced port was released for the PlayStation (titled Darkstalkers 3 in the U.S. and Vampire Savior: EX Edition in Japan) on November 30, 1998, adding all characters and gameplay mechanics from all three versions (each character now has two modes: ""Dark Force Change"" for the original version and ""Dark Force Power"" for the updated versions) while adding new secrets (including new secret character variations and custom gameplay changes) and a custom character option (allowing players to re-color any character and build up their stats by earning experience points). This version was re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita (both via PlayStation Network) on February 9, 2011 (in Japan) and April 24, 2012 (in North America).The last enhanced port was released as a mail-order game (in Japan only) for the Dreamcast (titled Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service) on 2000. This version adds online multiplayer while allowing players to pick any version of their chosen character (based on the games they were in, from the original Darkstalkers to the updated version of Vampire Savior). This version was later ported to the PlayStation Portable worldwide in 2004/2005 as Darkstalkers Chronicle: The Chaos Tower, adding a new single-player mode (called ""Chaos Tower"").The original version was also re-released in two compilations: the Japan-exclusive Vampire: Darkstalkers Collection (released for the PlayStation 2 on May 19, 2005) and the online-enabled Darkstalkers Resurrection (released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on March 12, 2013). It was later digitally re-released for arcades in December 4, 2014 via the NESiCAxLive platform for the PC-based Taito Type X¬≤ system. Released exclusively in Japan, this system allowed players to keep track of their Versus Mode stats via a special card and included online leaderboards. </div>  <div> Characters : The original arcade version of the game includes 15 playable characters, four of which are new. Three characters from the previous game were removed, only to be added back in with both the Vampire Hunter 2 and Vampire Savior 2 updates (replacing other characters based on the version) and most of the console ports (bringing the total roster to 18).While most characters fight antagonist Jedah as the boss battle, some characters have their own separate character-specific boss battles (which was later removed in the VH2/VS2 updates). Similar to Akuma in Super Street Fighter II Turbo, the game includes a powerful hidden boss (""Oboro"" Bishamon) that can only be faced if certain conditions are met (not selecting ""Auto"" mode, not losing a single round, and defeating two opponents with a specific EX move).Both the original and updated versions each introduced hidden characters who are not playable as themselves: Shadow is a supernatural being who takes control of the last defeated opponent (leaving the victor ""dead""), while Marionette is a literal marionette that takes control of a ""copy"" of the current opponent (creating a series of mirror matches).New CharactersB.B.

In Europe, the game was released by Acclaim.Powered by the same hardware as Sega's Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers, Dead or Alive is Tecmo's first attempt at a 3D fighting game and is notable as the company's last-ditch effort to save itself from bankruptcy in the mid-'90s. The studio behind the game would later become the Tecmo subsidiary Team Ninja and would use this name in the game's numerous sequels and spin-offs.The game is notable for its introduction of the ""Triangle System"", a series staple mechanic where standard attacks (Strikes) are countered by dedicated counter-attack grapples (Holds), which are itself countered by standard grapples (Throws), which are itself countered by standard attacks. In addition, the game is known for its tie-in with the Ninja Gaiden series (with the series protagonist as a playable fighter), its use of physics for breast movement, and its ""danger zones"" (where the outer edge of the arena is full of explosives, dealing high amounts of damage to anyone who lands on it and launching them helplessly in the air for additional combo potential). </div>  <div> Ports & Updates : The game was first ported to the Sega Saturn (as a Japanese exclusive) on October 9, 1997, adding new bonus game modes, gameplay options, and character costumes, along with the ability to unlock the final boss as a playable character. This version was later ported to the Xbox (as Dead or Alive 1 Ultimate), bundled with an enhanced port of Dead or Alive 2 in October 26, 2004 as Dead or Alive Ultimate. The Ultimate port featured online multiplayer functionality via Xbox Live.The game also received an enhanced port for the Sony PlayStation in Japan (on March 12, 1998), North America (on March 31, 1998), and Europe (by SCEE on July 1, 1998). This version added two new playable characters (wrestler Bass and ninja Ayane), bonus game modes, additional costumes, and updated arenas (which are now endless, similar to the Tekken series, with ""danger zones"" intact). This version was ported back to arcade hardware in Japan on October 16, 1998 (as Dead or Alive++, running on PS1-based Sony ZN-1 hardware) and was digitally re-released via the PlayStation Network (as a PSone Classic) exclusively in Japan on December 10, 2008. </div>  <div> Characters : By completing the game each time using a character, the player can unlock additional costumes. Some costumes can only be unlocked on certain difficulties, however. Unsurprisingly, the amount of costumes that can be unlocked for the female characters greatly outnumber that of the male characters (Kasumi has 14 costumes, while Zack has just 5), presumably adhering to Itagaki's tastes. The game even has a 'Breast Bounce' feature in the options menu that can be disabled.CharacterInformationKasumi </div>  <div> Soundtrack :  Nationality: JapanAge: UnknownStyle: NinjitsuOccupation: NinjaKasumi's brother, Hayate, was next in line to succeed as the 18th master of the Mugen Tenkin Acedemy...

It has support for several popular flight sticks available at the time, as well as native head tracking and stereoscopic 3D support with the VFX1, I-O VR and Cybermaxx virtual reality headsets. </div>  <div> Plot : The story follows the Material Defender who's hired by the Post Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) under a mercenary contract to investigate and reconnaissance information regarding a virus spreading through mining robots on planets spanning across the solar system. Along the way, he blows up corrupted fusion reactors and rescues hostages who have been captured by the diabolical robots. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each level takes place entirely underground in an intricate network of tunnels. Within every level typically features three locked doors that require color coded keycards, a reactor and an exit that is locked until the main objective is completed. The goal is to uncover the reactor and promptly destroy it, after which the player has a short amount of time to reach the exit. The primary obstacle keeping the player from their goal are rogue mining robots that attack on sight. An arsenal will assist them by finding weapons hidden in the mines or taking those dropped from destroyed robots. For extra points, each level contains hostages hidden somewhere in the mines, which will earn a rescue bonus if found. </div>  <div> Levels : Descent featured 30 levels, 3 of which were secret levels.The levels took place on a series of mining stations starting on the moon and then moving progressively further away from earth. The final level was set on Pluto with the final boss battle set on Pluto's moon Charon. </div>  <div> Arsenal : These are the main firearms available to the Material Defender. They all use the ship's energy as ammo, except the Vulcan Cannon.Laser - The starting primary weapon fires a pair of lasers. It's fairly weak compared to what can be found later on, but it can be upgraded three times to become a greater threat.Spreadfire Cannon - An energy weapon that discharges three orbs simultaneously in an alternating vertical/horizontal pattern. Its wide impact range is good for taking down packs of robots.Vulcan Cannon - A ballistics weapon that doesn't rely on energy to fire and moves at extremely high speeds. When the batteries run dry, this weapon will automatically take over.Plasma Cannon - The plasma cannon is a rapid firing energy weapon that deals a lot of damage, but it also quickly drains energy.Fusion Cannon - This is a cannon that needs charging up. It consumes a lot of energy, but it is as good as it gets for non-missile damage. The projectiles also over-penetrate targets for potential multikill action. Overcharging will result in damage to the player's own ship. </div>  <div> Power-ups : These are ammo-dependent missile weapons the Material Defender must pick up along the way to keep stocked. They generally do more damage than their laser-based counterparts.Concussion Missile - This is the standard short range missile. While it doesn't have the ability to lock onto targets, it's good for breaking up groups of enemies. There will be no shortage of these.Homing Missile - Unlike the concussion missile, the homing missile will lock onto the nearest enemy.Proximity Mine - Lay these down to destroy or impair unsuspecting foes. These are especially useful for multiplayer matches.Smart Missile - Upon detonation, the smart missile disperses shots that resemble those of the plasma cannon, except they lock onto nearby enemies. These are harder to find, but are extremely potent.Mega Missile - A large (one could say ""mega""-sized) missile that does crazy damage. It also sports a decent blast radius on impact, flinging hapless evil robots to and fro around any room in which it's fired. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Due to the weapons being primarily lasers the ship uses energy to power its weapons, with the exception of the vulcan cannon. Energy power ups can be found around the levels and are also dropped by enemies once they have been destroyed. Energy maxes out at 200.Shields are used as health and can be replenished by picking up power orbs around the level. The maximum power of the shields is 200. If a player finishes a level with below 100 shields they are restored to 100 at the start of the next level.If the players ship is destroyed all the power'ups he/she has picked up over the corse of time will be dropped around the place where they died as power ups. </div>  <div> Wii Release : The PC and Mac versions of Descent offered multiplayer deathmatch and co-op for up to 8 players over LAN connection. Unlike other multiplayer shoots of the time, for instance Doom, games didn't have to be set up with the players queued up before the match is initiated. In descent players could join games on the fly, and games could be easily set up from an in game menu.The PlayStation version allowed to players to compete against each other across two systems using the PlayStation Link Cable. </div>  <div> Music : In 2010 Interplay announced they would port Descent to Nintendo Wii. With no official statement since then, the project is assumed to have been quietly abandoned, however homebrewers have managed to port the game themsleves. </div> "

It was developed by Parallax Software and published by Interplay. It was released on MS-DOS, Windows 95, Mac OS, Mac OS X and Amiga. A PlayStation port of the game was also planned, but due to Sony's policies regarding ports from other platforms at the time, as well the platform's limited hardware and controller, the game was remade from scratch with 36 new levels and released under the name Descent Maximum in the US (it was still released as Descent II in Europe).In the game, players take control of the Material Defender on another mission given to him by the Post Terran Mineral Corporation (PTMC).As of 2006, the game is available on the online game service GameTap, and since 2008 it has been available on GOG as a bundle with the first game. On February 19, 2014, it was released on Steam, one week after the first Descent. Both the GOG and Steam versions use the Infinite Abyss release of the game, which has fewer music tracks than the original release, most noticeably cutting out most of the licensed music (there were originally three tracks by Nivek Ogre, and one by Type-O Negative, the Infinite Abyss release only has one of Nivek Ogre's tracks), but featuring longer mixes of the remaining songs.Descent II was originally planned as an expansion to Descent, but it eventually evolved into a full game. It was followed by Descent¬≥ in 1999. </div>  <div> Story : After what the Material Defender thought was the end of a long day, having destroyed all the mines in the solar system, he returns to a Post Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) base located in the asteroid belt. Eager to get his money and return home, Dravis confronts him with a new mission stating that, ""The PTMC reserves the right to keep you on retainer for up to 72 hours, post-mission."" Material Defender then has a warp core retrofitted onto his ship that extends his reach to distant planets with PTMC mines outside the solar system. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Descent games were some of the first FPS games to employ 3-D, polygonal and texture mapped enemies rather than sprites. The Descent series is known for popularizing the use of full 3D rendering, allowing for six degrees of rotation. As the player explore tunnels and mines as the Material Defender, many enemies must be destroyed in order to proceed. A variety of weapons and upgrades can be gathered to further speed up the destruction of these foes. To find the core of the level, certain color-coded keys have to be found as well. Once the core is found and destroyed, a countdown timer begins, and the player has a certain amount of time to find the exit, and escape the level. Every four levels, instead of a core reactor, there is a boss. The boss must then be defeated as a core reactor would be destroyed. There are six bosses in total throughout the game.Saving can be done at any time. It saves the exact location of the player, all items, weapons, enemies, and the Guide-Bot.The Guide-Bot is a new feature in Descent II. It serves as a companion robot that leads the player to objectives in the mission. The Guide-Bot shoots flares that can injure both the player and enemies. It is invulnerable to laser fire, but a large amount of missiles from the player or enemies can destroy it.Another new appearance in the game is the Thief-bot, which will roam around the level, sneak up on the player and steal some of their weapons or equipment, but never downright attacking the player. When fired upon, the Thief-bot will try to run away, and the player has to chase it down if they want to return their precious equipment. </div>  <div> Music : Zeta AquilaeQuartzonBrimsparkLimefrost SpiralBaloris PrimeOmega (divided into two: Puuma Sphere and Tycho Brahe) </div>  <div> New Weapons : Level 1: Ahayweh GateLevel 2: Turnabout BoreLevel 3: Wenl MineLevel 4: Robby StationSecret Level 1: Segment CityLevel 5: Seaspring GorgeLevel 6: The WellLevel 7: Coralbank QuarryLevel 8: Riverbed MineSecret Level 2: Hurdle ChaseLevel 9: Firewalker MineLevel 10: Lavafalls Extraction Ctr.Level 11: Coalbank ShaftLevel 12: Magnacore StationSecret Level 3: Mephisto HardcoreLevel 13: Sleetstone TunnelsLevel 14: Arcticon CorridorLevel 15: Icehammer CavernsLevel 16: Terrafrost CatacombsSecret Level 4: Galacia CavernsLevel 17: Y'tor IIILevel 18: Drec'nilbie K'luhLevel 19: Nep-Hilim S'crubLevel 20: Gytowt StationSecret Level 5: Ascent Level 1Level 21: N'neri RingLevel 22: Kwod A'riorLevel 23: IwihmlLevel 24: Tycho BraheSecret Level 6: Chain Reaction </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The PC version of Descent II featured two different options for music playback, the player could either choose to listen to redbook CD audio on the game discs, or an MIDI soundtrack available for users who couldn't play CD audio (which often required a special audio cable between the CD-ROM drive and the sound card in 1996), or hadn't done a full install, requiring the game to load from the disc during play. Unlike Descent 1, where the PS1 and Mac versions had CD audio remixes of the PC version's MIDI music, Descent II's CD music is entirely different from the MIDI music. Like Descent 1, there were separate MIDI songs for every level in the game, but only 14 (in some releases, only 8) CD tracks, making the music repeat on several levels throughout the game.The game's redbook soundtrack was largely composed by Interplay's in-house musicians Brian Luzietti, Larry Peacock and Johann Langlie, while the MIDI music was composed by Daniel Wentz, but a selection of licensed music by Nivek Ogre of Skinny Puppy, Mark Walk and Type-O Negative also were included (some of it was re-used from the Mac and PlayStation versions of Descent, which also had redbook audio, unlike the original PC release). The music during the game's cutscenes was composed by Peter Rotter.Many releases and re-prints of Descent II and it's expansion pack Vertigo have slightly different track lists, some with the songs in different orders, or with slightly extended mixes of some songs. The original release combines the title song and the next song, Crawl, into the same track (track 2, as track 1 on Redbook discs are used for the game data), while the Descent Definitive Collection and Infinite Abyss releases split them up into separate CD tracks. The track names for the music were supplied in the game's read-me file. Track listing for all the known variations are listed below (Interplay used to host an MP3 version of the original redbook soundtrack on their website, as a goodie for their fans, but had mixed up the tracks Techno Industry and Robot Jungle on that release): </div>  <div> Reception : Game DataTitle by Brian LuziettiCrawl by Brian LuziettiGlut by Ogre of Skinny Puppy & Mark WalkGunner Down by Brian LuziettiCold Reality by Larry Peacock, Brad Cross, and Leslie SpitzerRatzez by Nivek Ogre/Skinny Puppy & Mark WalkCrush by Brian LuziettiUntitled Track by Mark MorganHaunted (Instrumental Remix) by Type O NegativeAre You Descent? by Ron ValdezTechno Industry by Johann LanglieRobot Jungle by Johann Langlie </div>  <div> Descent II: The Vertigo series : Game DataTitle by Brian LuziettiCold Reality (Extended Remix) by Larry Peacock, Brad Cross & Leslie SpitzerCrawl (Extended Remix) by Brian LuziettiGunner Down (Extended Remix) by Brian LuziettiRatzes (Extended Remix) by Nivek Ogre/Skinny Puppy and Mark WalkTechno Industry (Extended Remix) by Johann LanglieAre You Descent?

The point of the game is to wreck your opponents car to score points. The goal players have to achieve in the game is fairly simple, but the popularity of the game grew by the minute, which then resulted in  Reflections releasing  Destruction Derby 2, the second instalment in the successful franchise. ¬†Several other Destruction Derby games have been released over the years, but the most memorable and successful is unfortunately only  Destruction Derby 2. ¬†  </div>  <div> Gameplay :  The game was unlike most other racing-games at the time of release, since the point of the game is to wreck your opponents car to score points - a gameplay concept which was new to the racing-game industry at the time. The basic idea of Destruction Derby is based on a real-life sport which involves, again, wrecking the opponents car. The winner of the ‚Äúrace‚Äù is the man who is left-standing with his car still intact - ‚ÄúLast Man Standing‚Äù kind of deal. In the game, when a round is finished the winner is decided by having the most points or by being the only car still intact, just like the real-life sport. This is what makes Destruction Derby unique and so popular, but there are other modes in the game where different rules apply. ¬†  </div>  <div> Modes :  Destruction Derby includes four basic modes which players can choose from.  </div>  <div> Cars :  In this mode there is a standard racing track involved where the player races against the opponents, fighting over the the best position (just like most racing-games) as well as gaining the most points by smashing up and wrecking the opponents car.   </div>  <div> Tracks :  Here, the only goal is to make first place or at least get into the best position possible. The key element when playing this mode is to avoid inflicting damage to the car so possibility broken parts wont slow the player down when fighting for a place at the podium. This is the only mode in the game which breaks of from the main concept where wrecking cars and inflicting damage is awarded. Simply put, this mode works like any other standard racing game. If the player comes first, he wins.¬†   </div>  <div> Damage Engine :  Standard time attack/time trail mode. ¬†  </div>  <div> Other :  This is the mode which got most attention upon it's release and is the most popular mode in the game. The mode takes place on a track called The Bowl which is a large open track. The only goal here is to inflict as much damage to the opponents car and at best, completely destroy them. ¬†  </div>  <div> Trivia¬†¬†¬†  :  There are three sets of car classes to choose from in the game ‚Äì Rookie, Amateur and Pro. These three different classes represents three different difficulty levels. Rookie is the easiest, Amateur being the normal difficulty and Pro is the hard difficulty setting. The main difference between the classes can be noticed as you go up through the cars they get faster and have better handling. But the car will also be able to handle less damage and is basically weaker as the difficulty level is higher. ¬†  </div> "

The game includes various game types; which are Trial, Battle, Wars and Puzzle. </div>  <div> Gameplay :      You control a little devil in a large grid of dice, and the objective of the game is to get rid of as much dice as possible until time runs out or the grid is completely filled with dice. You get rid of dice by creating chains. To do this, you have to line up connecting dice, and there has to be as many dice as the number of dots on the top face. For example, if you line up four (::) dice all connecting to each other, these dice will connect together and start to disappear by sinking into the ground. As the dice sink into the ground, you can move other dice of the same face number next to them, causing them to also start sinking into the ground, this method of play in called making a chain.This is true for sides two through six, to get rid of (¬∑) die, however, you have to move a (¬∑) die next to some disappearing dice (like you would if you were to chain the die), when you do this, all of the (¬∑) dice on the grid will start to disappear, except the die you are on. This move is known as the 'Happy One'. </div>  <div> Game Types : You can move dice is two different ways, walking on the die, or pushing the die. Whatever happens depends on the die type. There are five kinds of dice found in Devil Dice. </div>  <div> Hints and Tips : These are the most common types of dice, when the little devil walks on the die, the die will roll around, changing the face number. However, when pushed, the die will slide along the grid, not changing the face number. </div> "

Diablo,Climax Group,Activision,"March 11, 1998",ps,"An isometric action RPG that takes place in and below the town of Tristram. Gothic fantasy weapons and spells are used to defeat hordes of monsters from hell through randomized dungeon levels, continuously gaining experience points, gold, and a variety of equipment to bolster the hero's monster-killing potency along the way.",3030-5985,5985,0,1996-12-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/diablo/3030-5985/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Released in 1997 for the PC (and later the original PlayStation), Diablo is a dark, gothic-fantasy game blending RPG and elements from Arcade games, such as the original Gauntlet, to create a modern style of action-RPG where the player was often tangling with huge numbers of enemies at once.The original game was known for endless mouse-clicking ""hack and slash"" action in a single dungeon consisting of 16 levels. The dungeon is located under the town of Tristram, a sparsely populated town that consists of 6 NPCs who serve primarily as shop keepers to buy and sell adventuring equipment to the PCs and give out the occasional quest. Critics of the game will point to this lack of interaction within the game and the focus on mouse-clicking, killing things and taking their stuff as weaknesses in the game, while fans of the game will point to these same elements as the core of the gameplay's lasting appeal. Owners of the game could create a ""spawn"" version for their friends to use. The spawned version was mostly an extensive demo.Diablo was both popular and influential, spawning a number of sequels and spin-offs, including Diablo: Hellfire, a licensed add-on to the original game produced by Sierra Entertainment rather than the original development team of Blizzard North.Finally, the game spawned three direct sequels: Diablo II, Diablo III and Diablo IV. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Diablo has three character classes available for play, each with their very own character attributes, traits and specializations:Rogue -- These master archers have a slight level of magic but are not nearly as adept as that of the Sorcerer. Their focus is ranged physical damage.Sorcerer -- This ultimate master of the magic arts is trained to use pure magic to smite foes rather than direct melee combat.Warrior -- The pure melee combat warrior, he is the master of weaponry and defense.The Sorcerer Master of magic artsDespite the class-based system, character development is very free-form and is left largely up to the player. There are only a few elements directly tied to character class: each class has a skill available at 1st level that improves as the character gained levels; the character's class determines their starting and maximum attributes; the character's class determines how many hit points and magic points are gained with each level increase; finally, a character's class determines their starting equipment. Of these, the two that had the strongest effect on gameplay were the starting and maximum attributed and the advancement of hit points and magic points upon gaining a level.The Silent RogueThe Powerful Lone WarriorAttributes in Diablo are the primary limitation on a character's abilities. A high Strength score allows a character to wear heavy armor and melee weapons, a high Dexterity allows a character to use devastating ranged weapons and high magic allows the character to learn high-level spells. Thus the Rogue class begins the game with the highest Dexterity, the Sorcerer with the highest Magic, and the Warrior with the highest Strength. These classes can also achieve a much higher maximum attribute in these areas, allowing them to attain the most powerful weapons suited to their character class.Still, a Warrior could concentrate on Magic and become reasonably proficient in its use, a Sorcerer could work on Strength to wear heavy armor and so forth, allowing a player a great degree of flexibility in tailoring their character to their preferred play-style. This was one of the many game elements that increased re-playability. </div>  <div> Quest Monsters : The Butcher Emerging From his LairThe Butcher: A Demon killing the townspeople of Tristram. First (optional) boss.King Leoric: The former king of the land. Corrupted and twisted by Diablo. Now he wanders as a giant skeleton with a crown on his head.Gharbad the Weak: Offers the adventurer a magical item for mercy, then deems them unworthy.Snotspill: a Kobold that stole Ogden's sign.Zhar the Mad: Crazed sorcerer who gives the adventurer a spellbook.Warrior of Blood: Steel Lord who guards the entrance to the 14th level.Lachdanan: Blood Knight who seeks retribution which can be obtained by giving him the golden elixir.Archbishop Lazarus: a Priest who performed the ritual to tie the Lord of Terror to Leoric's son.Diablo The Lord of Terror: Demon who possessed the prince of the land. The main antagonist of the franchise. </div>  <div> Magic Items : Diablo also features an extremely diverse array of magical equipment, with magic items being powered by a prefix and suffix. Since the power of each prefix and suffix is variable and they could be found in any combination, this led to a stunning variety in type and power of equipment. There are also extremely rare unique items that had individual names, a unique appearance and abilities that were not found in normal items.Since these items are generated randomly as they are dropped in the game, a player is never sure what item could be in the next chest or held by the next monster. Indeed, a player could continue to play the same character, moving to a higher difficulty level with the same character, where the monsters would be more powerful but would drop items of increasing rarity. </div>  <div> Spells : Spells are used to cast magic which is important due to how frequently they are used throughout the game. They are not character dependent and are often found in spellbooks, staves and scrolls. Each class has its own unique spell as well.NameEffectApocalypseAll enemies in the area can be damaged.Blood StarFires a star at a target whilst it is slow, its mana consumption is low too.Blood SpiritSummons a spirit that homes in on a target, a very strong spell.Chain LightningSimilar to Lightning but creates more than one bolt and homes in on the monsters.Charged BoltLaunches several bolts on the ground, perfect for crowd control.Disarm TrapRogue's skill, grants the ability to see traps and disarm them.ElementalA fire elemental in the form of a person runs forward and aims towards the nearest monster which deals splash damage.FireballStronger version of fireball which creates a bigger ball of fire than firebolt and deals extra damage.FireboltLaunches a single small ball of fire at the enemy.Fire WallCreates a wall of fire which damages enemies in a line.Flame WaveFires a flame attack in the form of a wave capable of damaging multiple enemies.FlashRadius attack that first attacks the player in front and sides and even attacks behind the player.GolemSummons a golem used for attacking enemies.GuardianSummons a Hydra that shoots firebolts at enemies nearby. Perfect for detecting enemies.HealingGrants the player health.Heal OtherUsed in multiplayer, it grants health to other players.Holy BoltFires a bolt as holy damage, perfect for undead monsters and Diablo.IdentifyUsed to identify items while in the field. Items can also be identified back in town by an NPC.InfernoFires a flame for a short distance.InfravisionGrants the ability to see through walls and detect enemies.Item RepairGive the ability to repair item but also decreases the maximum durability (Warrior's Skill).LightningShoots a Lightning bolt at the player's direction.Mana ShieldUpon casting this spell, all damage is taken from mana as opposed to health.NovaCreates a ring of lightning that damages enemies within a radius.PhasingFaster version of teleporting but it randomly moves the player on the map.Recharge StavesSorcerer's skill, gives the ability to recharge staves but reduces the maximum charges every time it's used.ResurrectUsed in multiplayer to bring back a dead player.Stone CurseDestroys the enemies defense upon casting.TelekinesisUsed to interact with certain objects from a distance like opening a chest or pulling a lever.TeleportCan teleport around the area, perfect for evading battles.Town PortalCreates a portal to go back to town.  </div>  <div> Randomness : A distinct component of Diablo is that its dungeon maps were randomly generated every time a player started a new game. Because of this, it was impossible for a player to have an advantage in a second or third game by remembering where quest objectives were. This required each new game's dungeon to be mapped anew (which the game assisted with through an auto-map feature), meaning the player never knew where critical quest objectives or opponents could be found.In addition to the level randomization, many other aspects of Diablo's gameplay could change from game to game:Monsters on each level of the dungeon would vary, meaning a player might face entirely different opponents, requiring different tactics and abilities to succeed.As mentioned above, the way magic items were generated meant that a player was unlikely to see the same item twice over the course of multiple games not every quest was available in every game, meaning different tasks and rewards for each instance of the world.The quests in Diablo were also handed out randomly by the NPCs throughout the town. Usually, all quests could not be completed in one playthrough. </div>  <div> Ports : The PlayStation North American Box ArtIn March 1998, Electronic Arts released Diablo for the PlayStation. The PlayStation version lacked the key component of being able to go online. The workaround was to allow two players the ability to play on the same screen at the same time, something the PC version lacked. However, save games for Diablo were very large; a single save game could take as many 10 blocks on a PlayStation memory card. </div>  <div> Early MORPG : A final element of the game that increased its longevity was the free multiplayer component, available through Blizzard's Battle.net servers.As a multi-player game, Diablo's gameplay changed radically and resembled what we today would recognize as a Multiplayer Online RPG or MORPG. In fact, Diablo and Ultima Online could be seen as the two games that most strongly influenced the most popular online games of all time, Everquest and Blizzard's own World of Warcraft.In multi-player, players could team up and the number of players in the dungeon made creatures more powerful. Item drops were also increased based on the size of the player party. Many elements of the modern MMORPG were introduced into this environment, such as player to player economies, where rare items were bartered or bought with enormous sums of gold.Another unfortunate element of MMOs was introduced here, with players cheating to gain a competitive advantage over other players, or to get the rarest of the rare items. Blizzard's experience running Battle.net and managing both the economy as intended but also cheating was to prove invaluable in their development of World of Warcraft. </div>  <div> Influence : Diablo inspired a host of imitators who sought to recapture its addictive, simple gameplay. The most important of these are probably Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and its sequel on the PS2. Other games to follow Diablo in the Action RPG genre on consoles include Champions of Norrath and its sequel Champions: Return to Arms, which were Action RPGs set in Norrath, the world of the popular MMO EverQuest.The action RPG was adapted to other non-fantasy themes and settings as well. These include the super-heroic X-Men Legends, X-Men Legends II and especially Marvel Ultimate Alliance all three of which are set in the Marvel Comics universe.The Fallout RPG series tried their own version of a Diablo-style action-RPG with the Brotherhood of Steel game for the PS2.The action RPG has also returned to its PC roots with games such as Titan Quest, Fate & Torchlight, a modern attempt to recapture the magic of Diablo on the PCs. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Diablo was widely praised by critics, with a Metacritic average of 94. Many critics gave the game perfect or near-perfect scores. Notably, Computer Gaming World, an influential game review magazine for PC games gave the game a perfect score of 100.Game review site Gamespot gave the game a 9.6 which makes it one of the highest-rated computer games in the history of the site. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Cover ArtThe soundtrack for Diablo was composed by Matt Uelmen.Track No.Song TitleRunning Time01Intro01.3402Into Town04.4903Dungeon04.2504Catacombs05.5105Caves04.5906Hell04.1507The Nest04.0008The Crypt02.35 </div>  <div> System Requirements : Windows 95 or better60 MHz Pentium or better8 MB RAM (16 MB for multiplayer)SVGA compatible graphics card (640 x 480 maximum)2X CD-ROM drive </div> "
Die Hard Trilogy,Probe Entertainment,"Fox Interactive, EA Games","September 15, 1996",ps,Die Hard Trilogy is a video game adaptation of the original trilogy of Die Hard films which star Bruce Willis as John McClane.,3030-19345,19345,0,1996-08-09,https://www.giantbomb.com/die-hard-trilogy/3030-19345/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Die Hard Trilogy was developed by Probe Entertainment, who were later acquired by Acclaim. The game is an adaptation of the first three Die Hard films. Because each Die Hard film is represented by a different genre - Die Hard was adapted as a top-down third-person shooter; Die Hard 2: Die Harder was adapted as a Light-Gun shooter; Die Hard with a Vengeance was adapted as a driving game - Die Hard Trilogy was marketed as being three games in one, as the three ""games"" which were on the disk had enough depth to act as stand alone arcade titles.The games were developed as if they were arcade games. A running score is kept at the top of the screen across the three different modes, and typical arcade conventions of continues, high scores, scoreboards, and lives were applied.Die Hard Trilogy was very successful upon release. The game was banned in Germany, due to excessive violence and gore, particularly in the Die Hard with a Vengeance segment, where players can run over innocent pedestrians at will. The game sold enough to make Sony's Greatest Hits line in North America, and the Platinum line in PAL territories. A sequel, Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas, developed by n-Space, was released four years after Die Hard Trilogy. </div>  <div> Games : Players are put into the shoes of John McClane as he ascends Nakatomi Plaza, eliminating terrorists and saving hostages.The adaptation of the first film sets the player in Nakatomi Plaza with little reference to the film's original story. Instead, players make their way up each individual floor, from the ground floor at the bottom, to the top floor, some thirty-five storeys up. The different floors are made up of the roof, a parking garage, a ballroom, maintenance levels, office levels, and computer levels. Key to the gameplay was the top-down camera view and the tank controls which were toned down to make them more responsive and less taxing on the player.Each level is packed full of terrorists, all of whom the player must eliminate in order to complete the level. Once all terrorists are defeated, a bomb timer is triggered in one of the elevators in the level. The player has thirty seconds to reach the elevator in which the bomb is located - should they fail, a game over is triggered. Hostages are scattered throughout each environment, and the player gains health by saving them. There are also a myriad of pickups, including several special weapons such as assault rifles and shotguns which fire incendiary rounds. Each environment had many destructible aspects. Office divider walls break apart when shot; levels under ""construction"" can be razed to the ground.Throughout Die Hard, the player character - apparently John McClane, though this is never strictly stated other than in the manual for the game - utters several one liners from the film, and ones uniquely recorded by a Bruce Willis sound-alike for the game. </div>  <div> Development  : Terrorists are highlighted on the screen with crosshairs. The enemies that pose the greatest threat are highlighted in red.Die Hard 2 puts the player in John McClane's shoes. The game is played as a first-person shooter (though strictly speaking it is an on-rails light-gun game, and plays similarly to how Time Crisis plays without a light gun). Nine different levels are included in the game; each level takes players throughout the different settings from the film - the airport, the runway, the plane, the church, the snowmobile fight, among other locations.Similarly to the adaptation of Die Hard, terrorists and hostages are scattered throughout the levels. If the player shoots hostages they lose a significant amount of health. Terrorists drop armor and weapons when shot. The player can also use different types of ammunition, such as tracer rounds, as well as grenades and missiles. In order for items to be collected, the player shoots the highlighted pickups on screen. Several different types of enemies attack the player. Often, ""Head Honchos"" spawn into the levels, which are effectively sub-bosses. If the player does well in key areas in each level, secret areas can be unlocked with more weapons and health and ammunition.Die Hard 2 can be played with the PlayStation controller, or with the Scorpion light gun. </div> "

IGN who gave the game a 5.7/10 reported that ""Die Hard Trilogy 2 is yet another glance into the life of a catastrophe magnet, and the venue for an unfortunate sequel that takes a good concept and drives it straight into the dumpster.""Gamespot were slightly more enthusiastic, rating the game 6.3/10, reporting that as a rental, gamers may be pleasantly surprised and stating ""While it doesn't stack up well when compared with the original game, Die Hard Trilogy 2 does manage to outclass recent like-minded titles like EA's Tomorrow Never Dies, and it provides a nice fix for those who own PlayStation light guns.""Many reviews from non-professional gamers have reflected the critics views, judging from online reviews. </div> "

It has three direct sequels: Digimon World 2, Digimon World 3, Digimon World 4. This game predates the TV anime series in Japan, before many of the digivolutions, aspects, and tropes of the Digimon cartoon were established as canon. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Digimon have various needs that have to be taken care of including eating, sleeping, pooping, tiredness, and health. The majority of time spent raising Digimon (besides training, battling, or adventuring) involves feeding them, letting them sleep (each Digimon has certain hours in a day that it is awake), and letting them use a toilet. If the Digimon poops outside of a toliet, its Virus gauge begins to fill up. If it fills up all the way, the Digimon evolves into a Sukamon. Sometimes a Digimon can become injured from battle or become sick. These can be fixed by using an item or taking the Digimon to a clinic. Over-training the Digimon without rest can cause the Tiredness status, which lowers the Digimon's Happiness and shortens their life span. The Digimon has a Happiness and Discipline gauge as well. High Happiness causes the Digimon to live longer but become less obedient. High Discipline causes the Digimon to have a shorter life span but become more obedient. Digimon also have a Life gauge made up of three hearts. Each battle lost removes a heart, until there are no hearts left and the Digimon then fades away. Age, Weight, Happiness, and Discipline also have effects on the Digimon's ability to Digivolve. </div>  <div> Plot : Digivolution occurs once specific conditions are met, often after training certain parameters.Digimon have six parameters governing their fighting ability: HP, MP, Off[ensive], Def[ensive], Speed, and Brains. Parameter growth is achieved mostly thorough training at Green Gym in File City or training areas spread throughout File Island. Training areas outside of Green Gym increase a Digimon's parameters more but are harder to get to and only have a few training stations. Parameter growth also results from winning battles against other Digimon or preforming certain tasks like carrying dirt out of Drill Tunnel for Drimogemon, although these do not increase parameters as fast as actual training. Activating a training station will cause the player's Digimon to train for one hour of game time although this can be skipped by pressing ""triangle"". Depending on a Digimon's speciality, some parameters are boosted more than others. The effect of training can be increased by feeding the Digimon certain items or upgrading Green Gym by carrying out certain tasks in Beetle Land.Green Gym:Boulder Moving - HP/OffWaterfall - MP/DefTree Striking - Off/Speed ""Strike a tree for practice. Greatly boosts Offensive Power and Speed.""Punching Glove - Def/Brains ""Gain strength with punching machine. Boosts Defensive Power and Brains.""Running - Speed/HP ""Run around course. Greatly boosts Speed and Max HP.""[Trainer]'s Classroom - Brains/MP ""[Trainer] will teach many things. Boosts Brains and Max MP."" </div>  <div> Glitches : Every Digimon starts out as a Baby form. In 6 hours game time, it evolves into the ""In-training form."" Every baby digivolves into its own unique In-training Digimon.The next form is evolving into rookies. The Digimon evolve into this form after 24 hours. Training influences what the Digimon digivolves into. Depending on how certain stats are trained, the Digimon digivolve into 1 of 2 Rookie choices (again, dependent on the digivolution chart and selection of the Baby forms).The next digivolution phase is the champion phase, and happens 3 days after Rookie phase. All Digimon evolve into Champions, however, the Digimon digivolves into depends on a few parameters: number of battles, individual stats, the number of care mistakes (letting the Digimon poop without a toilet, fainting in battle, acquiring Tiredness state), and weight of the current form. Sometimes bonus conditions trigger digivolutions and some items can induce early digivolution. In some cases, not all parameters need to be met, just be relatively close to.The final form, the Ultimate form, is not always reached. This form can occur anytime after the 11th day of a Digimon's life span and only if very specific parameters were met. Digimon can fade away without ever reaching this stage, but Digimon at this stage are the strongest Digimon in the game and have access to the widest amount of battle attacks.Some Mega form Digimon appear in the game as NPCs, however, the player cannot digivolve raised Digimon into this stage. Alternatively, some Digimon that exist in this game as Ultimate forms are classified in later games and in canon as Mega form (HerculesKabuterimon, for example). </div> "

Every step you take runs out fuel, so players need to be careful of where they go or else they'll be transported back to base. Each Domain is filled with traps and enemy Digimon. The end of each domain usually has a boss Digimon or a tamer with a team of three. Defeating the boss will open the way to the exit portal, which will transport you back to base. ¬† Players can Digivolve their Digimon into higher and stronger levels by collecting DP (Digivolving Points). DP is earning by DNA Digivolving your Digimon, which means to combine two Digimon in order to obtain one brand new Digimon. </div> "

Dino Crisis,Capcom,Capcom,"September 1, 1999",ps,"Join Regina, as part of a special forces team sent to infiltrate a government facility, to discover the truth behind a scientific experiment that has drastically gone awry.",3030-11917,11917,0,1999-08-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/dino-crisis/3030-11917/,BBFC: 15," <div> Overview : Dino Crisis is a survival horror game for the PC, Dreamcast and PlayStation. Developed and published by Capcom in 1999, the game was developed by the same team that developed Resident Evil, with Shinji Mikami acting as director. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Laser grids can be used to keep attacking dinosaurs at bayDino Crisis is designed around a style of gameplay reminiscent of the survival horror Resident Evil entries, with many similarities including tank controls, a scarcity of ammo, and fixed camera angles that perpetuate throughout. However combat is made to be significantly more difficult and promotes the idea of flight rather than fight even more so than Resident Evil. The velociraptor dinosaurs the player will routinely encounter are much more durable than most enemies found in Resident Evil and can withstand more punishment. They can chase the player through multiple rooms should they opt to run away as well. If knocked over by a dinosaur, it is possible for Regina to drop her gun, forcing the player to recollect it for use.There are at least certain obstacles the player can use to help stop the advance of a dinosaur; there are firstly a number of laser grids the player will eventually be able to turn on or off at will. This may make exploration more difficult, but in the mean time will help keep a dinosaur at bay.Because of the scarcity of ammo and the aggressiveness of the dinosaurs, Dino Crisis also has available tranquiliser darts, that while it won't kill a dinosaur it will at least instantaneously put one to sleep for a varying amount of time. There are also poison darts that will outright kill a common dinosaur with a single shot, however they are extremely rare to obtain.Like Resident Evil, Dino Crisis includes many jump-scare momentsPlayers can of course choose between walking or running, however unlike in Resident Evil Regina must first go through a slight build up before reaching her maximum speed. Regina must also stay perched to the ground when firing, though she can at least move while readying her gun. Players cannot aim up or down manually, however Regina will instead aim as such when the situation calls for it, such as aiming downward at a sleeping velociraptor.Dino Crisis has the player coming across files and documents to help further the backstory or to possibly aid in solving one of the many puzzles throughout the game. However the files will not be archived in the player's inventory when read like in Resident Evil, and instead requires the player to manually jot down any notable passcodes or the like themselves. </div>  <div> Story : Regina can hold up to 10 consumable items such as healing supplies and ammunition, with a separate inventory menu for key items. As such the player will always have space for any such necessary keys and the like, and inventory management is governed purely around the player's supplies. Besides Regina's inventory, there are a number of Emergency Boxes that include a significant amount of supplies for the player to collect, while also offering a place for the player to leave unwanted supplies. However unlike the item boxes in Resident Evil, the boxes are color-coded and items can only persist across multiple boxes of the same color. Furthermore, they must first be unlocked with at least one item called a 'plug', otherwise it will be inaccessible.Mixing is the act of combining multiple supply types to increase their effectiveness. This typically revolves around mixing two small health packs to gain two medium ones for example, but it can also be used to enhance the strength of tranquilisers. Beyond mixing supplies together, there are also items that exist specifically to be mixed to increase an item's effectiveness. </div>  <div> Extra Crisis : Health works similarly to Resident Evil, however there is no formal indication of Regina's health, and players can only note her stance to read her condition. As Regina withstands more damage, she will begin to limp and hold onto her stomach, slowing her movement. There's also a strong chance for Regina to bleed after an attack, which will steadily decrease her health even further. The way to note if she's bleeding is if there are small puddles of blood that form under her feet per footstep.Should players ultimately die, there's a chance they will instead be taken back to the moment before they entered the room they died in, but only if they have a resuscitation kit on hand, otherwise they will fall back to a previous savepoint instead.The player is able to save the game indefinitely without the use of an item like in Resident Evil, though players must still first locate a Save Room to do so. Upon preparing to exit the Save Room they are then asked if they wish to save. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The personalities of Rick and Gail will continually clash throughout the storyThroughout Dino Crisis, Regina will have to choose between two options usually revolving around the contrasting personalities of Gail and Rick. Should the player side with Gail they will typically resolve situations with combat, and siding with Rick would lead to solving a puzzle instead to potentially sidestep a combat encounter. Nearing the end, certain decisions could also determine the ending of the game and which characters would survive.There are three possible endings in total, none of which have ever been officially confirmed as the canon ending. </div> "

Many differences were implemented to further retract much of the survival sense of gameplay and outfit it with a run 'n gun affair. An example of this is the surplus ammo that was available for the vast array of weaponry on offer.Two weapons are always equipped simultaneously with the playable characters having a primary weapon and a sub-weapon, such as a machete or stungun. Another major addition is the inclusion of new protagonist Dylan; while Regina is still playable in parts and a key character, Dylan takes over the lead role for Dino Crisis 2.Dino Crisis 2 was well received by critics, earning strong reviews for its fresh take on the genre and exciting gameplay. </div>  <div> Characters : Age: 24Member of a government espionage agency called S.O.R.T. (Secret Operation Raid Team), an expert in stealth missions and firearms. Regina is one of the sole survivors from the previous mission relating to Dr. Kirk on Ibis Island. Agility and cool composure are her biggest strengths. </div>  <div> In-Depth Plot Summary : Age: 25A member of T.R.A.T. (Tactical Reconnoitering and Acquisition Team), a special task force in the army, Dylan has willpower and strength. Though somewhat lacking in agility, his skill makes him excellent with heavy weaponry. </div>  <div> Dinosaurs : Age: 23Friend of Dylan and a member of the same team, David has a humorous take on danger and enjoys helping keep morale high. His compassion for his friends makes him an asset to the group. </div>  <div> Weapons : Regina and Dylan frequently encounter figures wearing black leather outfits and helmets all throughout the game. They are openly hostile, firing at the protagonists on sight. One of them seems different, however. </div>  <div> Extra Crisis : May 10, 2010; one year has passed since the events of the previous game. Doctor Kirk's research on Third Energy is now being overseen by a government organization somewhere in the American midwest. Unfortunately for them, another accident has occurred just like before. Edward City, a town devoted to the Third Energy research, has disappeared to another time along with all of its residents. In place of the town now lies a vast prehistoric jungle.Now might be the time to run.Regina, a member of S.O.R.T. (Secret Operation Raid Team), is assigned to a new mission largely in part due to her past experience, tagging along with members of T.R.A.T. (Tactical Reconnoitering and Acquisition Team) including Dylan Morton and David Falk. Their objective is to travel back in time, rescue any potential survivors and locate the missing Third Energy research data. Upon arriving and setting up camp however, they are soon attacked by a large pack of Velociraptors and overwhelmed. Almost the entire team is decimated. As Regina and Dylan are surrounded, there are suddenly impact tremors in the ground causing the attacking dinosaurs to flee. A Tyrannosaurus Rex appears from the jungle, but David uses a rocket launcher against it, taking out its right eye. They are then chased to a slope, escaping just in time to avoid certain death.Faced with two paths, the two decide to separate. Regina uses her stungun on a door to head back to the ship they arrived on while Dylan uses his machete to open a gate wrapped in ivy leading into the jungle. On reaching a water tower, Dylan encounters a strange figure wearing a black outfit and helmet who quickly runs away before he can interact with them. He eventually comes to a military facility where as luck would have it, the Tyrannosaurus shows up again, giving chase. Attempting to flee, he is shot at by two more of the mysterious figures in black and escapes into a nearby building. Using an incorrect key to a locked storage box, a security system activates, trapping Dylan inside the room. He sends a distress signal to Regina.Survivors?Back at the ship, Regina sets out for the military facility through an opposite gate so she can help Dylan. She crosses over a rickety bridge as the Tyrannosaurus passes below, but fortunately it is oblivious to her presence. In a large clearing, she avoids being crushed by a vehicle falling over a ledge and is attacked by an Allosaurus. Outside a research facility, Regina is also shot at by the black helmeted figures. Two get away but another fails to do so, nearly going over a ledge. After being saved, she handcuffs them to a pole inside a nearby security room. Upon removing their helmet, a teenage girl with blonde hair is revealed who apparently cannot speak and is still hostile. Regina leaves the girl behind and continues onward to Dylan, passing through an area with poisonous plants that must be incinerated with a flame launcher. She is once again attacked by the figures in black along the way, deflecting their shots with her stungun. Reaching the control room inside the military facility, Regina locates the correct key for the locked room and reunites with Dylan. She tells him about her encounter with the girl; they both return with her to the ship. A startling discovery is then made: the time gate allowing them to return to their own time has been sabotaged, along with the starting unit for the engine. Regina suspects that the figures in black are no doubt responsible and suggests looking at the nearby research facility for parts to repair the engine so they can at least get the ship moving elsewhere.Dylan handcuffs the young girl to the ship and strangely, after looking at his face, she stops struggling and acts as though she recognizes him. On his way he also spots the Tyrannosaurus lurking in the jungle like Regina did, but it doesn't notice him. Cutting through the ivy covering the door, Dylan enters the research facility. As he soon finds out, this area has become home to the Compsognathus and Oviraptor. The former has an attraction to shiny objects and steals a key card from Dylan as he goes to open a locked door; fortunately he cages the creature and gets it back. In the next room lie several containment tubes holding young humans; some are still secure while others have been smashed by plants wrapped around them tightly. Dylan finds a replacement battery in the back of the room and returns to the ship to find the girl has vanished. Regina mentions that upon checking into profiles of the residents, none of them matched up with the girl's description, almost like she doesn't exist.With the battery for the ship replaced, they travel to an offshore Third Energy research facility and are attacked by Plesiosaurs and Pteranodons over the open water, fighting them off with the defensive cannons of the ship. Once they arrive, Regina heads for the control room, restoring primary power to the area. Using a diving suit and a large-sized elevator, she descends into an underwater portion of the facility. Moments later the elevator comes to a halt due to a technical difficulty. While examining the controls, Regina is attacked by Mosasaurs and must proceed farther down on her own to an alternate entry point. After traveling through several passageways, opening the shutters that lead through the cooling aqueduct, she finds herself in the Third Energy reactor room. Suddenly a very large Plesiosaur appears, smashing into the reactor itself and triggering a security alert, locking down the area as a defense mechanism. Once the creature has been killed, water currents return to normal, canceling the alert and opening the path to an elevator leading back to the surface.Outside in a city dock area, Regina has just met up with Dylan when they receive a distress signal from David. He only has time to mention finding survivors in Edward City before the signal drops out, prompting the two to head that way immediately. Proceeding down a nearby jungle path they find a mark left on a tree by David; there will be many more to guide the way. Dylan is required to pass through a natural cave filled with streams of lava and dangerous Inostrancevia, making use of the chainmine. Once out of the cave, Dylan and Regina have to move quickly in a military facility teeming with Allosaurs. One of them moves forward while the other covers them with an artillery weapon, periodically switching places. When they finally reach a clearing, there are signs of humans having been killed by Triceratops' in defense, as they were deemed an enemy. Sure enough, a Triceratops appears, not amused by their presence. Regina and Dylan spot a jeep with a mounted gun and leave the area as fast as possible, while being pursued by two of the angry dinosaurs. They eventually take care of the situation, only to veer off a sudden cliff into a grassy field outside the city full of Velociraptors. Right as the two are surrounded, David shows up with an attack helicopter to save the day. David then spots dinosaurs in the streets finishing off most, if not all of the remaining survivors.Upon exiting the living quarters, Dylan is greeted by an old friend, the Tyrannosaurus. He spots a tank nearby, making a daring escape before the tank is crushed beneath a closing gate right as it passes underneath. Having been trapped on the other side for now, the Tyrannosaurus leaves. Dylan is attacked by one of the figures wearing black, the young blonde girl appears trying to intervene, and the figure is thrown off a high ledge and killed. He notices that the girl dropped something, a neckless his late sister used to wear; she had it with her all along. Dylan tells Regina about his past, how he used to be part of a gang. One day his mother and sister were home alone when a rival group broke into their home and killed them. Joining T.R.A.T. was a way for him to attempt to make up for his past mistakes. Having no reason to stay, he and Regina return to the ship.This will not end well.With only one location remaining unvisited, among the area with the poisonous plants, they head back to the jungle where they originally came from. Making her way through familiar paths, Regina is able to pass the poisonous gas zone safely using a recently acquired gas mask. Reaching a missile silo, Regina finally gets her hands on a data disc containing the Third Energy research. Outside however, something terrible awaits. Right when the Tyrannosaurus roams into the scene, a wall is smashed away to reveal a dinosaur that eclipses it in size, the Giganotosaurus. The Tyrannosaurus attempts to hold its own, but is ultimately killed. The Giganotosaurus follows Regina inside the missle silo, triggering an emergency alert with a timer of ten minutes. With valves to douse the dinosaur in flammable gas and igniting it using her stungun on the valves, Regina is able to at least temporarily subdue the creature while she moves to deactivate the emergency procedures. As could have been expected, the Giganotosaurus regains consciousness and crashes into the missile silo itself, starting a massive fire. Once she escapes from the burning building, Dylan and David are waiting, their idea to move farther down the river. When they come to a dam that needs to be raised, Dylan has to protect David using a defensive gun emplacement. Shortly thereafter David is killed by an Allosaurus after pushing Dylan out of its way, but also into the river, separating him and Regina as he drifts downstream.Dylan comes to on a riverbank in an unknown location, greeted by the blonde girl, who motions him to follow her through the jungle. Protecting her from the dinosaurs for a time, she eventually leads him to a large complex of some kind before running off. He heads inside to find a highly advanced research laboratory and the girl, who shows him the truth through a holographic recording of an older man.After the incident from the previous game, humans decided that the dinosaurs needed to be studied. Time-skewing experiments were carried out, producing devastating results that threatened everyone once it became clear the humans and dinosaurs could never coexist. August 10, 2055: The plan was to transport the dinosaurs through a time gate, three million years into the future where they could thrive, then be sent back to their own time once the gate had been perfected; the Noah's Ark Plan. However, something went wrong during the transportation, and as they were about to come back the gate disappeared, leaving them stranded. It seems that Edward City itself had been transported into the future, with there being no way for them to survive in a world now ruled by the dinosaurs. The hologram explains that his wife was killed and daughter badly injured; her name was Paula, the young girl. With the survivors' population dwindling, the children were placed in life support chambers that kept them protected while still allowing for growth and learning. Unfortunately they lost the ability to speak while inside the chambers. They learned how to survive around the dinosaurs, and because of the Noah's Ark Plan, thought they were supposed to protect them. These children became the figures in black wearing helmets that Regina and Dylan frequently encountered. It is revealed that the hologram is actually Dylan himself from the future, making Paula his daughter. The hologram of Dylan says that there is an unfinished time gate in the next room, instructing him to go with Regina, take the children and return to their own time. However, this gate can only be used once.Regina says her goodbyes.Dylan and Paula are notified that a self-destruct sequence has been activated, and are promptly attacked by the culprit, one of the figures in black. Dylan struggles with the figure, but is interrupted by the Giganotosaurus rearing its head once again. Using nearby terminals he manages to set off a remote satellite laser from orbit which targets the massive dinosaur, completely obliterating it. Paula is trapped under falling equipment as the facility begins to fall apart. Despite Dylan and Regina's best efforts, they can't move it, while time runs dangerously short. Dylan decides he will stay with her, telling Regina to learn about Third Energy using the research data, build a perfect time gate and come back for them. Regina promises, rushing through the gate and disappearing. Dylan and Paula are moments from being crushed when the scene pans outward showing the inevitable final explosion.It remains unknown whether or not Regina was able to fulfill her promise. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Meaning: Swift Seizer, Length: 4.8 meters, Height: 1.8 metersThe most common enemy in the game, they always come in numbers.

A critically acclaimed game at the time, it boasted striking graphics and impressive sound. </div>  <div> Plot : Disney's Hercules follows the plot of the movie, where super-powerful Hercules finds out that he is the son of the Greek God Zeus. In order to prove himself as a true hero and sit alongside the other Gods at Mount Olympus, Hercules must rescue the damsel in distress, Megara, from the centaur Nessus. However, Hades, the god of the underworld, is not making things easy for Hercules by sending fierce titans after him. </div>  <div> Gameplay : For the most part, Disney's Hercules is a side scrolling action game where the player takes control of Hercules.They must jump over obstacles and slash enemies with Hercules' sword to progress through levels, however the player is given the ability to move in and out of the background scenery with the use of the Z-axis. Combo moves also allow the player to execute moves more complicated than the basic sword attack.Hercules also has a Power Punch ability, which takes time to recharge each time it is used. Another gameplay element is the ability to interact with environments. For Instance, the player may have to destroy a stone pillar with the power punch ability, stomping on the ground to find secret areas or throwing boulders to defeat enemies.Disney's Hercules also feature several third person running sequences where players must dodge and jump over obstacles as they are constantly moving through a level.There are also many boss fights in the game, which usually involves evading some form of attack, and striking at a window of opportunity exploiting some form of weakness. </div>  <div> Levels : There are 10 levels in the game, all of which are based on different parts of the Disney movie; </div>  <div> Collectables : 1: ""Your basic D.I.D**Damsel in distress""This is the first level of the game and serves as a training course. It's filled with mechanical training opponents, and has no boss fight.2: ""Hero's gauntlet""This level is one of the third person running levels where Hercules keeps running and you must jump, move sideways and control your speed (only slightly). There are some power-ups you can run over like a pair of boots that increases your speed for awhile. This level also takes place in the training grounds like the first one did.3: ""The Centaur's forest""This level takes place in a forest with lakes and cliffs. It is pretty straight forward and can be compared to the first level, except with different enemies and environment.It ends with a boss fight against the centaur Nessus where the player must avoid attacks and ride on his back to deplete his health.4: ""The big olive""This level takes place in the grand city of Thebes. It is filled with pedestrians, some of whom will damage the player. There are also roads to cross with chariots running through in high speed. During this level the player must fight a boss, which is a centaur in the middle of the city. The player must avoid the thrown rocks, and throw boulders at the boss until he dies. Later in the level the player must also rescue the citizens from a swarm of birds attacking them.5: ""The hydra canyon""This level consists entirely of a boss fight with a hydra. The player must chop of its heads, while avoiding attacks and boulders falling from the roof.The level takes place in a canyon as the name would suggest.6: ""Medusa's lair""This level also consists entirely of a boss fight against Medusa. As commonly known, Medusa's stare can turn people into stone, and the player must utilize this by reflecting her vision with small shields that the player can hide behind. First however, the player must get her to destroy some pillars which the shields rests upon, while at the same time killing skeletons being spawned.7: ""Cyclops attack""This level is another one of the third person running levels, where the player must run through a destroyed Thebes, towards the cyclops titan who is destroying the city. While running the player must avoid rolling pillars, fleeing pedestrians and chariots, and disappearing stone ground.8: ""Titan flight""This level is different from the others since it consists of the player riding on Pegasus (a flying unicorn). The player cannot stop moving forward so in that sense it is similar to the third person running levels, however in this level movement happens sideways, and the player can move up, down, forward and backward (From the far left to the far right of the screen). The level takes place in the sky, with clouds and distant landscape (with titans destroying it) in the background.During this flight the player must avoid falling stone, swirling fire, gargoyle-like creatures and attack some of them too, while on the horseback. This chaos is created by the titans Hades released.At the end of this level Hercules frees Zeus.9: ""Passageways of eternal torment""This is the last third person running level, and it takes place in Hades realm (The underworld) where Hercules must run to Hades (which he fights in the next and last level), evading souls, skeletons, falling rock and spikes, rolling boulders and holes in the ground.10: ""Vortex of souls""This is the last level of the game and consists entirely of a boss fight with Hades. During this fight Hercules must scale small cliff edges on each side of the level, while attacking Hades. At the same time, the player must avoid falling blue fire, and Hades who shoots out blue energy balls that can chase the player.Secret areasSome of the levels have secret areas, which contains extra collectables (see further down). Some of these secret areas can be found by stomping the ground with a special air move until it shatters and others can be found by moving through the scenery to places that would seem unimportant, and are not in the linear line trough the level. </div>  <div> Cutscenes : In each level there are coins, letters, vases, weapon upgrades, helmets and small vases to be found.Collecting coins gives you a higher rating at the end of the level. This rating is represented trough sentences like ""Hero"" or ""Not bad kid"".The letters of each level spell out ""Hercules"" and if you find all 8 letters in one level, you are awarded with a continue (In case all lives are used up).There are 4 vases in each level, and if you find all of them in one level, then you are awarded with a secret code that you can use at anytime from the main menu to start at the mission you found all 4 vases in.This actually serves as the games save system, which is a bit unusual since you often have to go out of your way to find these vases.Considering that the game is mainly marketed towards kids this is even more unusual (for the added difficulty in restarting over and over), and it's quite ironic to think of the fact that most new video games today, feature savepoints pretty much all the time, which basically makes this kids games save system more challenging (and frustration) than many mainstream video games of today.During many of the levels you can also find weapon upgrades that you can swap between freely, but they all have a limited charge. These weapon upgrades includes:Flame sword - Shoots fireballs that chase enemies.Lightning sword - Shoots a straight line of lightning that you can move around the screen, damaging enemies.Sonic sword - Lets out a ring which damages everyone around the player, basically doing splash damage.The helmets that you can find allows the player to be invulnerable for a short period of time, when activated.The small vases gives the player extra lives. When you run out of lives you will be forced to start over, unless you have a continue or a secret code. </div> "

There were two kinds of collectibles spread throughout the levels; one was letters, which when put together spelledOne Of The Bonus LevelsT-A-R-Z-A-N, aswell as 4 pieces of a ""jigsaw"" (of sorts), which when put together revealed a mosaic of a monkey's face. If the player found all the letters, they would be granted to a bonus level of some sort. These varied from either a young Tarzan floating down a river, to an older Tarzan riding an Ostrich. In these levels the player has 30 seconds to get as many coins as possible before time runs out, aswell as an unspecified red fruit that, when caught, extends the time available by 5 seconds. Whereas if the player catches all four pieces of the mosaic they would be treated to a movie clip, pulled directly from the animated Disney movie. These are mainly used to extend the plot, beyond the regular cutscenes inbetween levels. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay is largely 2D basic platforming, although with one or two 3D mini-games thrown in. One that is prominently used is the view switching behind Tarzan as he slides down a massive tree branch. The player must duck, jump and lean right or left in order to avoid objects and therefore get all the coins. There are two levels in the game where theplayer will be controlling a character other than Tarzan. In the level Baboon Chase the player takes control of Jane; an English lady who serves as Tarzan's love interest throughout the game. Aswell as in the level Trashing The Camp the player takes control of Turk; a baboon who serves as Tarzan's best friend during his childhood. </div>  <div> Plot : The plot of the game closely resembles the plot of the film largely because the only remnants of a story are put forward by movie clips directly pulled from the 1999 animated motion picture. The player goes through 4 levels as young Tarzan, before going through a montage of Tarzan getting progressively older. From this point on the player controls ""Old"" Tarzan (like Old Snake, but not). There is a sub-boss halfway through the game, where Tarzan defeats the Cheetah, in a similiar situation to how the events occur in the movie. The last level culminates in a showdown with Clayton, the main antagonist in the game. Similiar to many games of the time period, the final boss battle is reliant on Pattern Recognition, and must be taken advantage of in order to defeat Clayton. </div> "

It was later ported by Panic Button to the Nintendo Switch (without SnapMap functionality) on November 10, 2017.The fourth mainline title in the franchise of the same name and its second reboot, Doom harkens back to the fast-paced philosophy of early Doom and Quake installments (avoiding the slower survival-horror mechanics of Doom 3). Along with a full-fledged single-player campaign (with upgradable gear), the game features standard loadout-based multiplayer (co-developed by Certain Affinity) and a detailed level creation system (which is called ""SnapMap"" and is co-developed by Escalation).Set on a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on a futuristic Mars overrun by the forces of Hell, the main campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious silent protagonist known as the Doom Slayer. Awakened from a mysterious sarcophagus and armored with his high-tech Praetor Suit, the Doom Slayer must fight hordes of demons and possessed humans throughout the facility while learning of the events that's transpired (involving the harvesting of Hellish ""Argent"" energy) and preventing a larger rift between the two realms.It is the first game to run on their proprietary id Tech 6 engine and had had a long nine-year development cycle (including an original concept as a cinematic game detailing a Hell invasion of Earth). Months prior to the game's release, the multiplayer portion received both closed and open beta testing periods. Post-release, the game has received numerous updates (including new gameplay options, new game modes, and SnapMap improvements) and multiplayer content packs by Bethesda Austin (along with a season pass, with all content later made available to all in July 2017).The game later received a VR-focused spin-off (Doom VFR) on November 30, 2017 and a full-fledged sequel (Doom Eternal) on March 20, 2020. </div>  <div> Gameplay :   </div>  <div> Campaign : Rip & Tear (The UAC)Know Your Enemy (Resource Operations)Meltdown (Foundry)Beginning of the End (Argent Facility)Argent Tower (Argent Energy Tower)Into the Fire (Kadingir Sanctum)Hell on Mars (Argent Facility Destroyed)A Brighter Tomorrow (Advanced Research Complex)Lazarus (Lazarus Labs)Titan's Realm (Titan's Realm)The Crucible (Necropolis)I Am VEGA (VEGA Central Processing)The Well (Argent D'Nur) </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Pistol - Rechargable semi-automatic energy pistol that has infinite ammo and is given at the very start of the game. It is automatically modded with the Charged Energy Shot (which allows players to charge up and fire a more-powerful shot).Combat Shotgun (Shells) - Standard pump-action shotgun for close-range combat. Players can mod it with either the Charged Burst (which allows players to charge up and fire a volley of three shells in quick succession) or the Explosive Shot (which allows players to launch mortar shotshells).Plasma Rifle (Cells) - Fully automatic energy rifle that fires pulses of plasma capable of dealing minor splash damage. Players can mod it with either the Heat Blast (which allows players to release a damaging blast of excess heat, which is recharged by regular firing) or the Stun Bomb (which allows players to launch plasma orbs that detonates and stuns enemies).Heavy Assault Rifle (Bullets) - Fully automatic assault rifle for ranged combat. Players can mod it with either the Tactical Scope (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges) or the Micro Missiles (which allows players to launch small missiles).Rocket Launcher (Rockets) - Standard rocket-propelled grenade launcher that fires rockets at a straight path, dealing explosive damage over a large radius. Players can mod it with either the Remote Detonation (which allows players to detonate their rockets mid-flight) or the Lock-on Burst (which allow players to lock-in to a target and fire a volley of three rockets in a quick succession).Super Shotgun (Shells) - Old-fashioned double-barreled shotgun that deals powerful close-ranged damage (at the cost of requiring a reload after shooting). Although the weapon cannot be modded, players can still upgrade it with faster reloading, improved shot penetration, and single-shell firing.Gauss Cannon (Cells) - A large and powerful railgun that fires flechettes at a high velocity. Players can mod it with either the Precision Bolt (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges while charging up high-damage shots) or the Siege Mode (which allows players to remain stationary to charge up a powerful beam that overpenetrates targets).Chaingun (Bullets) - Rotary machine gun with a rate-of-fire that gets faster as the gun spins up. Players can mod it with either the Gatling Rotator (which allows players to spin up the barrels without firing) or the Mobile Turret (which allows players to ""unfold"" the barrels into three smaller gatling guns that do not need to spun beforehand, reduces movement speed, and can overheat).Chainsaw (Fuel) - An old-fashioned chainsaw. Unlike the Chainsaw in previous Doom games, it does not need to be continuously ""fired"", and is instead used to trigger a special glory-kill animation (without needing to stun the enemy first). Tougher enemies require more ""Fuel"" for the animation to take effect. Enemies who die from Chainsaw Glory Kills drop massive amounts of ammunition for other weapons. Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button).BFG (Argent) - Massive energy weapon that charges for a short time before firing a large ball of energy that vaporizes everything in its short blast radius (while dealing damage to those nearby the projectile). Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button).  </div>  <div> SnapMap : The game's central multiplayer component pits up to 12 players in team-based combat (although free-for-all modes were added post-launch). Unlike multiplayer modes in past id games, Doom's main multiplayer mode takes its cue from popular first-person shooters in the past decade and implements both weapon loadouts (where players choose their two pre-determined weapons and one piece of equipment, all of which cannot be swapped out while alive), persistent leveling (where players unlock weapons, gear, and cosmetic options for both armor and weapons), and online matchmaking (with pre-determined playlists and lobby voting).It also ties in to the in-game lore by having all players as soldiers participating in UAC's virtual reality battle simulator (announced by the VEGA artifical intelligence). Throughout the match, VEGA announces and spawns limited-use power weapons (including the Chainsaw and BFG) and power-ups (including one that transforms the player into their preferred demon type as a player-controlled ""boss character"").Players can also participate in traditional deathmatch and co-operative multiplayer using the alternate SnapMap mode. All weapons and armor cosmetics in the main multiplayer mode is also available in SnapMap. </div> "

Most of the game's assets were later used in the Saturn spin-off Dragon Ball Z: Shin Butoden.The ""22"" in the game's name is due to the fact that the game features 22 playable characters from the franchise at the start (and the player can unlock 5 more, which changes the title screen to Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Battle 27). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays similar to the original Super Butoden trilogy of fighting games, with each players having access to three attack buttons (‚óª for Punch, ‚úï for Kick, and ‚óã for Ki Blasts), a button to toggle between ground and air layers (‚ñ≥), and quick Dash maneuvers (L1 and R1). </div>  <div> Characters : Along with standard arcade (1P vs. COM), versus (1P vs. 2P), and tournament (Championship) modes, the game features a ""Build Up"" Mode, where players choose a character (or load one from a memory card, if one is available) and level them up in consecutive fights. In addition, the game features a special versus mode (known as ""Build Up Battle"") where players can use their Build Up characters.Along with extending the character's life bar (adding additional colored layers), players can increase the power of their character's specific attacks by using them in combat.

It is the seventh game in the  Dragon Quest series (The series was referred to as Dragon Warrior in the U.S. until the release of  Dragon Quest VIII) , the only game in the main Dragon Quest series to be made for the original Playstation console and the first Dragon Quest game (from the main series) released in the U.S. since  Dragon Warrior IV. The game was developed by Heartbeat and  Arte Piazza under the supervision of  Yuji Hori's  Bird Studio for  Enix, with music by  Koichi Sugiyama and art by  Akira Toriyama. The game is known for being over 100 hours long, without partaking in any of it's optional side quests.The game follows the Hero and his band of friends as they discover secrets about their small port town of Estard and the island in which it rests. By inserting magical shards into an ancient ruin close to their home, they unlock portals to different parts of the world. The catch - these portals send them to a different continent, in a different time, and by solving the particular continent's dilemma, releases the continent from it's temporal prison. This allows for more parts of the world to be explored in the present, the player slowly bringing the world to life, one continent at a time.While Dragon Warrior VII may not play too differently from it's predecessors, it does include an extensive class system with over 50 available classes. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Dragon Warrior VII (AKA Dragon Quest VII) plays like an evolved version of the original Dragon Warrior for the NES. Mostly because that's exactly what it is. The Dragon Quest series is known for having created the formula that most Japanese role playing games (JRPGs) use today. While most of the adventure is rendered in 3D, combat is still performed in a first person perspective and the world map is 2D with an isometric view that's reminiscent of the role playing games released for the SNES. Combat is turn-based with up to 4 party members. While the flow of Dragon Warrior VII is similar to that of a traditional Dragon Quest, world exploration is a bit different. In prior Dragon Quest games a player could simply level up in any part of the world and would be free to explore all of it, unless however, a specific mode of transportation was needed. In Dragon Warrior VII, the player must first unlock different parts of the world from Estard Fane by collecting missing shards. Estard Fane functions as a miniature HUB world with pedestals missing different shards, once the correct shards are placed in the correct pedestals, the pedestals can be used to teleport to a land trapped in the past. Once the player defeats the evil or solves the crysis locking the land in it's temporal prison, the continent is freed in the present. This allows players to re-explore certain areas with purpose, but it also allows for the player to see their influence on the world in both direct and indirect ways. What's important to note however, is that the shards required are collected through the player's travels, but for the most part are completely miss-able, requiring the player to open every chest they come across and to fully explore the world.Since the player is likely to rescue a continent from the past, then explore it in the present, the game has an episodic feel to it. </div>  <div> Class System : Dragon Warrior VII employed a class system similar to that of  Final Fantasy V and  Final Fantasy III, though your characters do not start out with any class at the beginning of the game. In order to be able to change classes you must first reach Dharma Temple. Upon Reaching Dharma Temple you will be able to choose from 10 initial classes (Warrior, Fighter, Thief, Bard, Mage, Mariner, Cleric, Dancer, Shepherd, and Jester). Any time you wish to change your characters class in the game you must first return to Dharma Temple as it is the only place that you can change your characters class. </div>  <div> Fragments of the Forgotten Past : The North American Box Art Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past is a remake of the seventh Dragon Quest that was developed by ArtePiazza for the Nintendo 3DS and released in Japan on February 7, 2013. Not only does the title feature a fully redone presentation with polygonal characters, instead of the 2D sprites from the original, the game's opening hours were redesigned and streamlined. The remake also has visible enemies on the the world map instead of random encounters and party members appearances change depending on which class they are assigned among other additions. Nintendo published the remake outside of Japan in 2016 directly because of western fans campaigning to have the title localized. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The soundtrack for Dragon Warrior VII was composed by  Koichi Sugiyama, who has handled all the composition for previous  Dragon Warrior games. </div> "

Dragon Valor,Namco,SCEE,"October 16, 2000",ps,Dragon Valor is an Action RPG created by Namco for the PS1 in 1999. It was the third and final game in the Dragon Buster series.,3030-3705,3705,0,1999-12-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-valor/3030-3705/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Dragon Valor is the third and final game in the Dragon Buster series of action role-playing games. The first chapter of the game is essentially a remake of Namco's 1984 arcade classic Dragon Buster. The player originally controls Dragon Buster's protagonist Clovis (though he looks markedly different) and fights across several maps in a scrolling brawler-type hack & slash format, along with platformer elements. There are additional RPG elements that allow the player to power-up their character and unleash magical spells, the latter in a similar manner to Golden Axe's screen-clearing special abilities.In Clovis' chapter, the player can decide the girl he ends up marrying out of the two he meets while adventuring, depending on the moral decision of whether he rescues Princess Celia (the princess in the original Dragon Buster). This choice decides who the next protagonist will be, as each new main character is invariably the child of the previous protagonist and his betrothed. The rest of the game branches out in a similar manner, with many various main characters to unlock. Although each character more or less fights similarly in melee, they have different spells with varying effects.There are several generations of protagonists and several different endings. The different possible genealogies were intended to increase the replay value, as a single run through the game tends to be rather on the short side.Several characters from Dragon Valor appear in Namco Super Wars for the Wonderswan, a cameo-filled ""Namco mythos"" game that's a precursor to Namco X Capcom. </div> "
Driver,Reflections Interactive,GT Interactive,"June 30, 1999",ps,The original Driver is a classic driving game for the original Playstation.,3030-7020,7020,0,1999-06-25,https://www.giantbomb.com/driver/3030-7020/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : The game puts the player in the role of John Tanner, an undercover cop who is chosen to work undercover due to his superb driving abilities. The missions are given to you by a mob boss. These missions can involve anything from tailing someone to see where they go or completely removing them off the road. As you play undercover you are no longer seen as a member of the law, so the police are always trying to stop you, adding a real sense of excitement. Your wanted level is measured in the form of a felony bar which increases every time you break the law; this also includes simple errors such as skipping a red light or speeding. The game does come with its very own speedometer. There is a single player campaign to play through in which you unlock different challenge modes to play through. </div>  <div> Single Player Campaign : The campaign begins with a compulsory tutorial level in a car park, which shows the player all the different techniques that can be used in the game, including burnouts and handbrake turns. Once the tutorial is completed, the player is plunged into Miami, starting off with various tasks such as being the getaway driver in a bank robbery, or delivering a fast and fragile supercar without damaging it. Tanner's work eventually takes him to other cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. Once the game is finished there is a hidden level in Newcastle, England (as this is where the production team was from). This level isn't fully fleshed out and acts as more of an Easter egg than a real location. </div>  <div> Non-Campaign play : In Driver, there are two different training stages, the first being the Car Park and the second being the Desert.  The Car Park training is more of a close-quarters test of driving skill where you will have to preform such challenges as; a Burnout, using the Handbrake, doing a Slalom through support columns, a 180¬∞, a 360¬∞, a Reverse 180¬∞, Speed, Brake Test, as well as complete a full lap around the outer perimeter.  The player will be forced to play through and complete all challenges before starting the Single-Player Campaign and taking jobs from the ""Get A New Job"" option from the answering machine in the players apartment.  The Desert course is more of a slalom course made up of cones and barricades where the player has to try and get through as quickly as possible, with as little damage to the car and as few penalties; from hitting the cones barricades, telephone poles or trees. </div>  <div> Comparisons : From the very beginning of the game, the player can choose to drive freely, with no objectives, around the cities of Miami and San Francisco. Once the other cities are unlocked in the campaign mode, they are playable in this free mode. </div> "

Pink Lenny has double crossed Solomon Caine, and is now working for his enemy, a Brazilian known as Alvaro Vasquez. Tanner must find and capture Pink Lenny, as Solomon Caine wants to kill him for double crossing him. Lenny has also been responsible for causing a large gang war in Chicago through his actions.The elusive Avaro Vasquez, head of the tattooed Brazilian mob operating out of Rio, is turning his business interests to mainland USA. Violence threatens to ignite America when a U.S. crimelord`s money-man cuts a deal with Vasquez - his greatest rival. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is vehicle oriented, and most of the missions take place in a car. One of the advancements made in Driver 2 was that you could get out of your car and commandeer another vehicle. The only downside to doing this was that you could only do it whenever there were no police chasing you. The game's missions normally are made up of tailing suspects, ramming cars, or escaping from enemies. Before almost every mission, a cutscene plays to advance the storyline. All the violence in Driver 2 takes place in a cutscene.Driver 2 also contains driving games such as , quick chase, quick getaway, survival, gate race, trail blazer, checkpoint.Multiplayer includes cops and robbers, capture the flag, take a ride and checkpoint racing. </div>  <div> Characters : Officer Tanner is the main character in Driver 2.

Time To Kill features recognizable enemies that appeared in the classic Duke Nukem 3D, new environments, weapons and a new story revolving around Duke trying to stop the aliens from altering history. As Duke attempts to stop the alien menace he must travel through time which leads to the inclusion of many classic settings as levels, such as a Wild West level and a level set in Roman times.As the first third-person Duke Nukem game, the game borrowed elements from games such as Tomb Raider in an attempt to connect with the PlayStation audience and refresh the gameplay. Although this was successful to some degree and provided a new challenge, the gameplay was not as smooth and functional as some people would have liked and had some similar flaws to the games which it borrowed ideas from. The fact that the seminal 3D game had built up such a cult reputation did not help the switch from First-Person perspective to third.Time To Kill features a 28 mission single-player campaign and also features a 2-player competitive deathmatch mode. </div>  <div> Plot : In Time To Kill, the intro video starts out with Duke arriving at a bar where the infamous Pig Cops make their appearance via teleportation. The Pigs turn Duke's macho motorcycle into a small pink bicycle which subsequently leads Duke to demolish them.In the first level (a hub stage for teleporting to new levels), Duke learns that the aliens are planning to travel through time to alter the history of the planet to suit their needs. Duke quickly realizes he needs to acquire 3 special crystals to power a time machine will which will allow him to track the aliens wherever they tread and do what Duke does best. As Duke follows the aliens, he is taken to classic settings from history such as a Medieval setting with the large castle and a Roman theme which has Duke sporting a fantastic toga.Duke will return to the first level on several occasions after completing the altered history levels, where once again he must acquire the 3 crystals to activate the machine once more and progress. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Duke Nukem: Time To Kill controlled and played very similarly to Tomb Raider, with a behind-the-character view that stuck always to Duke's back. The game was very action-focused, with some semi-acrobatic environmental exploration and mild puzzles. The game also contained Duke's trademark sense of humor to a good degree although some of the jokes weren't received as well as some of the more memorable ones from Duke Nukem 3D. There were also environmental references and parodies of several films and games, some of which Duke himself comments on throughout the game. </div>  <div> Levels : Mission 1: Time to KillMission 2: Duke HillMission 3: Miner 69erMission 4: Gold And GunsMission 5: The ReaperMission 6: Obey Or DieMission 7: The Family JewelsMission 8: Resistance Is FeudalMission 9: Holy TerrorMission 10: Wing'ed DeathMission 11: Pig FactoryMission 12: Hog HeavenMission 13: Let The Games BeginMission 14: Blood BathsMission 15: Moloch The Gatekeeper </div>  <div> Weapons :  </div>  <div> Gadgets : Duke's melee attack, a good kick to the face. </div>  <div> Enemies : A new weapon featured in Time To Kill, the throwing axe was a fairly novel weapon although ultimately not super useful. </div> "

Notable productions featuring Rhythm & Hues visual effects include Hocus Pocus (1993), Hollow Man (2000), Superman Returns (2006), The Life of Pi (2012), and The Mist (2017). In 2013, Rhythm & Hues filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, though the studio lives on after being purchased by 34x118 Holdings, LLC. that same year.Originally, Eggs of Steel was exclusively available through the Blockbuster Video chain of rental stores in 1998.

The game is known for the inclusion of guest characters from Square's recently-released JRPG Final Fantasy VII (Cloud and Tifa) as mid-bosses.The story involves a mysterious broken sword (known as EHRGEIZ) that was crafted from an unknown material. For 50 years, the sword is presented (similar to a championship belt) to the winner of a tournament to determine the world's strongest martial artist. When the secret ""Red Scorpion"" organization uncovers a Middle Eastern ruin that requires a special key to open, it is believed that EHRGEIZ is the secret to unlocking it.It was later ported to the Sony PlayStation (and released by Square) in Japan (on December 17, 1998), North America (on April 30, 1999), and Europe (on February 8, 2000). Along with six new characters (four of which are also guest characters from Final Fantasy VII) and new game modes, this port also includes a sequel to the action-RPG Quest Mode found in the Tobal games (titled ""Brand New Quest: The Forsaken Dungeon""). It was later digitally re-released by Square Enix for the PlayStation Network (supported on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita) exclusively in Japan on July 9, 2008. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Evolving from the free roaming combat of Tobal 2, Ehrgeiz places additional emphasis on allowing characters to more fully explore and exploit the environments. Among other options, it's possible for characters to pick up weapons, throw crates, attack from elevated positions and trap opponents against pieces of the scenery in order to subdue them.While other fighting games tend to have some form of dash function (normally via double tapping in a direction), characters within Ehrgeiz will sprint by default in any of the eight directions. Blocking is similar to that of Tekken, where normal attacks will be blocked if the stick is left in the neutral position (no direction is being pressed). Special attacks are executed by pressing the ""special"" button, though usage is governed by a gauge which, when depleted offers an alternate special attack. Other tactical options available are quick recoveries, interrupts, counters and wall attacks. </div>  <div> Characters : The base game includes eight playable characters from the start, with three boss characters (that are automatically unlocked for play after a certain amount of playtime on the arcade board) and one bonus boss opponent (fought in the credits). The game's two mid-bosses are guest characters from Square's JRPG Final Fantasy VII.The PS1 version adds six additional characters (five of whom must be unlocked by game completion) while unlocking the two mid-bosses form the start.

While the player was still limited to four movement directions (up, down, left, right), many of the backgrounds could be blown apart and damaged (increasing scores and power-ups, of course). Combined with Square's signature full motion videos, the resulting imagery represented the best of what the PS1 could offer at the time. Arguably more remarkable than the visuals, the gameplay was accompanied by a grinding techno soundtrack composed by artist Kenichiro Fukui.Given its strong audio-visual presentation, Einh√§nder received significant critical acclaim in both Japan and North America. Despite the positive press, the game failed to produce strong sales in North America. Some have attributed the mediocre response to the game's lack of a two-player mode, which made little sense for a game modeled after a classic arcade shooter. It did not help that Square failed to promote the game strongly in North America: gamers and critics alike had to wonder whether a company dedicated to RPG's could produce a quality title completely outside the genre. </div>  <div> Backstory : Like most shooters, Einh√§nder's plot serves merely as a conceit to drive the action, and to explain why exactly the player must destroy everything in sight. But in as much as it explains the combat, Einh√§nder is set in a future in which the Earth is at war with the Moon. The game's protagonist, a pilot for the Moon Colony Selene, is tasked with going on a one-man mission to cause as much damage to the Earth's capital as possible before being destroyed. During his raid, he learns that these suicide missions will be shortly replaced by similar attacks conducted using unmanned drones. Nevertheless, the Selene military demands the pilot's heroic sacrifice. Not understanding the reasons for war, the pilot survives the raid on Earth, and decides to return to the moon and take down the military authority that decided to sacrifice him. </div>  <div> Game : Like most shooters, Einh√§nder made its own variations on the traditional shooter mechanic. Upon starting a new game, players can choose their ship, which configures the starting weapon and upgrade potential. Upgraded weapons come in the form of gun pods, which are cannons that attach to the top and/or bottom of the ship, and fire weapons. Most weapons consisted of standard shooter fare: spread cannons, bombs, homing missiles, and machine guns; however, more unique weapons, such as light sabers, could also be obtained. Players could sort through available weapons, though ammunition for each was limited to a pre-set amount.From the outset, players are given a number of lives and continues that vary depending on the game's difficulty setting. For the North American version there is no free-play option, which made completing the game a challenge in and of itself. Though not as challenging as competitive shooters like Ikaruga, Einh√§nder rewards players for repetition and completion, and emphasizes score-based competitive gameplay. Scores are based on a multiplier built through destroying enemy ""cores"" that appear when enemies are destroyed. Yet just as weapons disappear after use, the score multiplier goes down if it is not actively being increased. </div>  <div> Weapons : Vulcan: Gatling gun that shoots about 500 rounds before depletion.Cannon: Strong one-shot-at-a-time gunpod. Can destroy multiple small enemies.Spreader: Fires 5 rounds in a fan shape (also fires backwards).Wasp: Rocket launcher that becomes a homing launcher when mounted on the top position.Blade: Basically a lightsaber.Grenade: Explosive rounds shot in an arc (also fires backwards).Hedgehog: Fires explosive flares above or below fighter.Riot: Fires a bolt of electricity that damages enemies from the inside-out (can be charged for stronger attack)Juno: Stronger version of the Vulcan but fewer rounds.Mosquito: Missile that can be controlled by player once shot.Python: Fires a string with grenades attached to it. A potent weapon but the aim is random.Flash: Most powerful weapon in the game; fires a bolt of light that cuts through enemies. </div> "

He became entangled with the three mercenaries when they tried to capture and ransom his escaped daughter, Wee Ming.Voiced by: Geoff Hoff </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primarily an action game focusing on basic weapon combat, Fear Effect was praised for having well-designed and sensible puzzles wrapped in an anime aesthetic. </div>  <div> Visuals : Combat consists of a series of encounters against enemy NPC's. While featuring videogame mainstay assault rifles and shotguns, players can dual-wield single-handed weapons such as pistols and uzis. Similar to the Tomb Raider franchise, characters can move while firing and dual-wielded guns can be trained on multiple targets. To keep combat fresh, the player could sneak up on unwitting enemies and perform assassination techniques. More than a way to get a one-hit kill on an opponent, these moves allow for silent kills when equipped with the characters particular melee weapon and restores a small portion of the Fear meter. If done properly, it's possible to kill multiple enemies in areas without being detected.Which is important for the health system implemented in the game. The Fear Meter represents the characters current pulse rate and is correspondingly stressed and relaxed by being shot, managing ammunition resources, succeeding at puzzles and reaching plot related events. When the meter moves from green to deep red, the character topples over and dies.Some boss battles are constructed to be puzzle-based. Situations ranging from shooting flags to jam a harrier jets turbines or fighting on a platform of retracting stones add to the variety. </div>  <div> Story : The game features tank controls, in which forward is always 'up' on the D-Pad and the character has to physically rotate in other directions before moving in them. To aid the player, a targeting reticle appears whenever the character lines up to attack. Appearing in the top center of the screen, the symbol turns green when players can attack and red when the character is close enough to an enemy to perform an assassination.The inventory management in the game, was criticised for being assigned to 'circle' and 'square' on the controller. These buttons cycle inventory through a daisy chain of items into weapons into items.  </div>  <div> Alternate Endings : One of Fear Effect's greatest strengths is the dozens of fully integrated puzzles. Differing from the puzzles found in its contemporaries, Fear Effect followed the internal logic of its world and worked within the confines of its plot rather than the arbitrary, senseless ones worked into games in the Resident Evil mold. Puzzles range from spatial reasoning to linguistic riddles. </div> "
Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix,Kronos Digital Entertainment,Eidos Interactive,"February 21, 2001",ps,"Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix is a prequel to the original Fear Effect for the Playstation console. The game's story reveals the conditions under which the three protagonists from the first game met each other, and the events that preceded the story of the original Fear Effect.",3030-17000,17000,0,2001-02-20,https://www.giantbomb.com/fear-effect-2-retro-helix/3030-17000/,BBFC: 15," <div> Overview : Fear Effect 2 is a survival horror game released exclusively on the PS1, and was the final game (out of only two) in the Fear Effect series before it was canned. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Fear Effect features the same kind of gameplay seen in the early Resident Evil games. This means also that the game has fixed camera angles, that some times makes it hard to see the enemies. Unlike the Resident Evil games which focused on survival horror, Fear Effect focuses more on action with puzzles featuring just as often if not more so than the action segments.,. The characters have an assortment of weapons, which they use throughout the game. These weapons are mostly of the shooting kind. The weapons are pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and a taser. Each character also has their own melee weapon which can be used to enact stealth kills. The fear meter returns from the first game. Unlike most games, Fear Effect has a heath meter that works differently. The meter is a heart pulse that beats faster and faster when your character takes damage. Death puzzles also return. These are puzzles in which, if you make the wrong choice or move, a cut-scene appears showing your character dying in graphic detail.The entry of the game is through 4 discs, however the player is to constantly switch through per chapter using each disc for around 2 chapters each. It will also go in an unnatural order with the story beginning from disc 1 then leading disc 2 then disc 4 back to disc 1 and so forth. </div>  <div> Presentation : Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix has a futuristic cyberpunk theme to it. The developers further focused on this, by making the game in cel-shaded animation. The game features dark and gloomy environments, as well as beautiful environments. The game also has mature content, from graphic violence to sexual hints. The game also focuses on the lesbian relationship between Hana and Rain. </div>  <div> Characters : Hana Tsu Vachel: She is half French and half Chinese. She was a member of the criminal organization, known as the ""Triads"". They mainly used Hana to seduce and kill her targets. Hana has since broken away from them, even though they still claim her. She now does jobs for the highest bidder, and will use whatever means necessary to complete a job. She does this in order to pay the Triads the debt, they claim that she owes to them, so that she can finally free herself from them. While living life with a cold demeanor, she will prove many times that there lies a loving warmth inside of her, especially when it involves Rain. Her unique melee weapon are her fists.Royce Glas: Was a well respected military commander. Glas was so well known in the Military, that a secret group, not even known by the CIA, would hire him to lead a group of soldiers on a shadow operation. The operation went horribly, as Glas would discover a shocking truth. Disgusted with the Military he served most of his live, Glas leaves the service. Now suicidal, yet still wanting a soldiers death for himself, Glas becomes a mercenary for hire. Most of the guilt is temporarily remedied through alcohol, however his character development through Retro Helix will have him settle alot of his past demons. His unique melee weapon is a small baton.Jacob Decourt (Deke): Is a cold blooded psychopath, who only cares about self pleasure. For him that's money, sex, and murder. So he becomes an assassin for hire. He would kill anyone, even women and children, provided he's paid enough for it. He has Australian origin-his accent proves it. Deke would become infected with a disease, and would take a job in hopes of getting the cure. His unique melee weapon are spiked brass knuckles.Rain Quin: She was discovered by Hana during one of her missions. She has since become Hana's partner, in many apects. She is plagued by strange dreams, that might just have the answers for her past, as she doesn't seem to remember much about it. She is a technical wonder and is most suited to the hacking sections of the missions she goes on with Hana. Her unique melee weapon is a dagger.Jin (Last name never revealed): Jin is a long time friend of Hana, knowing her since her days working for The Triads even. He assigns Hana and Rain their mission details and objectives. Paranoid and maybe a little neurotic, his banter with Hana acts as some of the humor during Retro Helix. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Fear Effect acts a prequel giving the events to how the initial three mercenaries from the original came to meet. It starts the player off as Hana along with her partner and love Rain Quinn who is the new character soon joining the core three. A prologue details Glas as a depressed drunk and Deke who seems to be suffering from some disease with him coughing up blood and requiring medication.It shows Hana amidst an assassination mission to which she seduces an unkown man before killing him with a bullet to the head leaving him in the bathtub, still with the smile on his face from the expression of witnessing Hana undress. </div>  <div> Alternate Endings : Soon after Hana is briefed on a new mission by her contact and friend Jin. He explains about the discoverer of a cure for the virus that is currently wiping out 100's of people through their genetic code.Hana meets with Rain at the sewer ducts and they manage to infiltrate their way through while also encountering rogueHana during the Aqueduct level in her bodysuit.sentry machines and the remaining insane sewer workers. One of which explains what happened with the Fixer robots suddenly just opening fire upon the workers and handing Hana half a piece of mirror. Another in particular manages to capture Rain and attachs her to some strange device that is suspected to be of a sexual intent. Hana manages to kill him and release Rain, but not before the crazed man reveals to still be alive and sets off the bombs he planted around the aqueduct. Hana and Rain manage to evade the blast and make their way to the surface.Chapter 2From there, Hana and Rain split up with Hana then putting on a sultry and equally revealing dress to infilitrate the party as a member while Rain is to stealth her way through the gardens gaining some added data concerning the security bypass'.Hana will come into contact with a charming gentleman who she briefly converses with after he hands her a bell for her to keep for luck.Soon after Hana will work her way into the Gold members section and locate the Doctor. With some easy persuasion she is able to get close enough to pluck some of his hair which will help identify herself as him during the procedures in the facility.Rain manages to bypass all the security features to finally gain herself the disk required to help with the formula theft of the cure. She will sneak off to a maze and dress herself in a stylish dress and meet up with Hana where they head to the elevator. Upon arrival, the camera in the elevator will pinpoint them and begin an identity verification, to which Hana quickly decides to do a faux peepshow with her throwing her dress over the camera. </div>  <div> Controversial Marketing : Reaching the 30th floor the elevator stops with Hana leaving to investigate. Strangly the elevator begins to work again and Rain is conveniently sent to the 33rd floor. Hana goes through the hassle of duplicating the formula's genetic detail while Rain disguises herself as one of the researchers with the goal to plant a bomb in the archives to cause a big enough commotion so the two to get out of there unnoticed. Hana makes her to Rains locations while Rain is found out and attacked upon. Arriving at the elevator there is a large man equipped with a heavy machinegun/grenade launcher. Rain will take him down and use the launcher to blast through the elevator.The two will switch back to their dress' and make their way casually out of the building as the sirens are blurring throughout the party. </div>  <div> Fear Effect: Inferno : The story then departs from Hana and Rain and switches to the control of Jakob 'Deke' Decourt onboard a freighter after just doing a silent kill on a sailor. He picks up a hexagonal like object and makes his way outside. Being spotted, Deke continues down the hub of the boat igniting an explosion in the crew quarters killing the sailor behind him and with Deke just barely jumping off of the boat avoiding the blast.The story then takes Deke to a Japanese ghost town in the middle of meeting with a ''skinny China-man''. He hands over the hexagonal object and demands that he gives him the antidote for his disease. The Chinese man complies, but only before revealing Deke had been doped. Deke passes out from drinking his spiked tea and awakes in a junkyard surrounded by shambling creatures resembling zombies.He shoots his way through eventually managing to find a key and some fuel for a monster truck. He then uses the vehicle to run down the Chinese man that drugged him. The truck crash lands with Deke sparcely making his landing on the edge. He makes his way through the ghost town stumbling upon levitating Chinese ghosts of sorts. He manages to get through a well decorated building that is filled with the things, leading to a wooden walkway. He notices more of the ghosts advancing on him as they overwhelm Deke. The story then cuts to Royce Glas arriving in the town riding his Mech robot.Glas spots a woman stuck under some debris and helps her out. She warns him of the monsters and hands him a good luck charm. He offers her some of his rations, but finds that she has disappeared.It then switches the focus to Hana, now riding towards the Ghost Town where Deke and Glas already are on a motorbike, alone, with Rain staying behind because of Hana thinking it might be too dangerous. Hana will eventually stumble upon Deke who manages to save her from some of the zombies, but forces them to separate. He'll meet up with her again for Glas to follow behind. They'll introduce each other with plenty of attitude being thrown around the room. They'll all put their pieces on the table with Hana's genetic code off the Doctor, Deke's ''doohickey'' object, and Glas will place a blood sample, which he describes as useless since Hana's already got the genetic code on disc.Hana and Glas agree that this doesn't seem right and that the deal should be scrapped, but only before Deketo then pull a gun on both of them ordering them to hand over their items and hinting burying them both in the tomb below the town. Glas will throw a pipe bomb at Deke, stunning him, while grabbing his blood sample. The explosion will cause a wall to crumble revealing more zombies that storm in. Glas will tell Hana to chase Deke while Glas holds off the zombies.More debris will fall onto the zombies and Glas will head towards his Mech, shooting through more of the incoming horde. However, his Mech will be too heavy for apart of the ground below and falls beneath, coincidentally landing in the same area where Deke crashed the monster truck.Hana still on the chase of Deke will then find herself ambushed with his brass knuckles to her neck. Rain, with her impeccable timing, will arrive to shoot Deke saving Hana. Deke is presumed dead, or at least mortally wounded, while Hana hands Rain the items and tells her to go.Rain does so only for her to eventually lead herself back to the room where Deke was shot. She is then captured by Deke in the same fashion as when he grabbed Hana. Hana arrives soon after, and is demanded by Deke that she's to collect Glas' blood sample, and he'll be waiting in the tomb below, otherwise he'll kill rain. While laughing manically, he jumps off of the edge - which should of definitely killed a normal human being, alluring that there's something mystical within Deke.Glas then recovers from his fall and makes his way to the area were Deke kept putting his brass knuckles at everyones necks. Along the way he stumbles upon a peculiar old man who asks if he can help find his donkey and explains the history of Shia-Shqun (the Ghost Town). Glas reluctantly offers his help just to shut the old man up, and the old man gives him an apple as thanks. But before Glas can reply the man vanishs. Eventually he comes across Hana who asks for his sample; he refuses where she threatens that she wasn't asking. They get into a quick brawl with her gaining the advantage by pointing her gun as Glas' crotch. They call a truce and both decide on hunting down Deke.They rappel their way to the tomb with Glas asking ''So how did he snag your partner?''. </div> "

Final Fantasy I,Square,Squaresoft,"October 31, 2002",ps,"Final Fantasy was the first entry in the now widely recognized Final Fantasy franchise, originally developed on the NES by Square (now Square-Enix).",3030-8403,8403,0,1987-12-18,https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy/3030-8403/,CERO: A," <div> History : In 1987 a small and struggling video game company called Square put all their remaining resources entirely into the hands of the Director of Planning and Development named Hironobu Sakaguchi. They earnestly hoped that whatever game he made would be a hit. As Hironobu was convinced this would be his last game ever, he called it Final Fantasy. </div>  <div> Overview :  Opening text. Final Fantasy is a single player role-playing game (RPG) which lets the player control four characters called the ""Light Warriors."" They begin by rescuing a princess from the Notorious Knight Garland. Soon after, they are given the world spanning task of collecting four Orbs of Light and defeating four fiends. The fiends went by the names of Lich, Kary, Kraken, and Tiamat. They had taken the Orbs from the rightful place they belonged and spread corruption over all the lands, skies, and seas. After many battles the Light warriors had collected items, gold and experience. When all the fiends were defeated, it was revealed that they took Garland‚Äôs corpse and sent it back in time. He had now become a mass of living evil known as Chaos. Confusingly Chaos sent the four fiends into the future where they currently plagued the world. Only when Chaos was defeated in the past and the four fiends were defeated in the present, was the world's natural balance finally restored.Final Fantasy was originally considered overbearingly difficult. Saves only came at resting in a Town‚Äôs Inn or using an expensive item known as a House. Spells in the late game cost more than half a million gil, and had a limited number of charges that could only be replenished by resting. Monster encounters could go from simplistic to overpowering at a moment‚Äôs notice. </div>  <div> Battle System :  Fighting wolves in the MSX version.Attacks were played out in turn based combat. All characters and monsters all were told what to do before the round began, be it cast a spell, use an item, or commit a basic attack, and all actions were then played out from the fastest person on the battlefield to the slowest. In the original game, some attacks could be useless. For example, if a Fighter and a Thief were both instructed to attack a goblin they would both do so. If the Thief killed him, it wouldn't stop the fighter from doing exactly as he was told by swinging his sword at the space the goblin once stood instead of at the other enemies present. This was later altered in the re-releases for the PSOne, Game Boy Advance, PSP, and iPhone versions, so the attacker would automatically attack the next available target. </div>  <div> Innovation :  Crafting a party from six available classes. Pictured is the default party setup: Fi, Th, BB, RM.The player chose their party of four with some combination of Black Mage, White Mage, Red Mage, Thief, Fighter, and Black Belt characters. These classes could be upgraded by the Dragon King, to; White Wizard, Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Ninja, Knight, and Master. Players traveled the world in vehicles, such as; boats, airships, and canoes. In combat, up to 9 monsters of various types could battle the player's party. Unless they soared through the skies in an airship or strolled in a safe area like a town, 'random encounters' were always possible. In these Encounters, a band of monsters could emerge and strike the party. Mages had a limited amount of spells they could learn.Final Fantasy had almost 20 musical tracks. Some of which, like the tune played after 'Victorious battle' and the 'Opening Theme', remained in one form or another in Final Fantasy games for decades to come. </div>  <div> Music : The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Some of the tracks became the trademarks to the Final Fantasy series: like the ""Prelude"", played on the title screen, and the ""Victory Fanfare"", which is played after every victorious battle. </div>  <div> Version Differences : The PSOne release of Final Fantasy was under the title of Final Fantasy Origins and contained enhanced remakes of both Final Fantasy I and II using higher quality MIDI and cleaner 16-bit graphics. These enhanced remakes were initially ports of the Wonderswan re-releases that never made it to the US for various reasons, most notably because the Wonderswan Color was never released in the US. Aside from the obvious graphical face-lift, various changes exist in the PSOne version that differ from the original NES version. An easy mode was created for the original Final Fantasy (increased Gil and EXP curves), auto-re-targeting, a temporary quicksave, and the addition of new items such as Phoenix Downs (revive a fallen ally) and Gold Needles (remove petrification). </div> "
Final Fantasy II,Square,Square,"October 31, 2002",ps,Final Fantasy II follows four heroes who join a resistance group and try to stop an empire from taking over the world. Its gameplay deviates greatly from the first game by utilizing a usage-based growth system.,3030-2094,2094,0,1988-12-17,https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-ii/3030-2094/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Battle from the Famicom version.Final Fantasy II is a sequel to Square's Final Fantasy and was only released in Japan on the Famicom in 1988. An English-language NES release was originally planned under the title ""Shadow of Palamecia"", but it was never completed. The game has since then been remade on various other platforms including the WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, PSP, Game Boy Advance and iPhone. The game does not share any connection with the original Final Fantasy's world or characters, establishing a precedent all entries in the primary Final Fantasy series have since followed. </div>  <div> Story : Beavers are crucial to the story of Final Fantasy II.Final Fantasy II is about four heroes, including main protagonist Firion, who join a resistance group called Wild Rose and try to stop the Empire of Palamecia from taking over the world. The dialogue in Final Fantasy II is a lot more dynamic than the first; players can ask NPCs about key terms and items to advance the plot or unlock certain events. It is also the first Final Fantasy where party members can join and leave the party during the game. Final Fantasy II also introduced elements that have since become defining concepts of the Final Fantasy series. It is the first game to feature the chocobo, a mount that would let the player ride across the world without any random encounters, and a character named Cid. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Battle scene from the PSP remake.Final Fantasy II's combat and character progression use different systems than were seen in the original game. Instead of gaining experience points to increase in level and raise stats across the board, the heroes gain skill levels for the attributes they use in battle. For example, if they use swords, their strength and sword skill will increase; if they get hit in battle, their hit points will increase.A glitch in the Famicom version of the game registers canceled stat-boosting commands. If the player were to repeatedly input and cancel a particular command, they could conceivably give the related stats a substantial boost before the end of a single battle. This glitch was fixed in later ports.Final Fantasy II also introduced the idea of party formation to the franchise. The player could move their characters to the back of the line in battle, reducing their chances of taking damage while limiting their own attack capabilities to using bows or magic. </div>  <div> Version Differences : As stated above, Final Fantasy II has seen numerous iterations since its conception. What follows below are the different versions released over the years and the iterative changes with each subsequent release. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The original Final Fantasy II was released for the Famicom in Japan and was set to release in North America supposedly with the subtitle Dark Shadow Over Palakia. With the looming release of the Super Nintendo and a long localization process, the 8-bit version never made its way outside of Japan despite the success of the first Final Fantasy and Square advertisements of the beta version. The Famicom version was re-released in Japan as part of a compilation with the first Final Fantasy in 1994. This version still remains exclusive to Japan despite Nintendo's claims that each pre-PlayStation Final Fantasy would be released over its Virtual Console service. </div> "

It was released on the Super Famicom on April 2, 1994. Six months later, on October 11, 1994, it was released as Final Fantasy III on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. Final Fantasy VI was later re-released on the Sony PlayStation (its first European release) and Game Boy Advance. The Playstation versions added load time pauses before each battle, but it is still a good game despite this flaw. Both of these rereleases were developed by TOSE and published by various publishers.Final Fantasy VI is generally considered by fans and critics alike to be one of the best console role-playing games (it has a 94% rating on GameRankings), let alone Final Fantasy games, ever made. The game was met with wide critical acclaim, being praised for its varied and complex characters, interesting story, and graphical excellence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game to not be directed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, instead of being co-directed by Yoshinori Katase and Hiroyuki Ito. The composer for the game was famed Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. Yoshitaka Amano created the character design for the game, which were then converted into sprites (taking small liberties from time to time, such as changing hair color) by the graphic design team headed by Tetsuya Takahashi (head graphic designer), Hideo Minaba (background graphics), Kazuko Shibuyo (object graphics), and Tetsuya Nomura (who designed some characters).The game also utilized the Super Nintendo's unique Mode 7 capabilities. When exploring the map, the world scrolls in a pseudo-3D fashion, common to Mode 7 style graphics. </div>  <div> Plot : The Japanese version's final battle screensWhen released in North America, Final Fantasy VI had many changes from the original version. The first and most noticeable is the name change; from Final Fantasy VI to Final Fantasy III. Despite the name change, the game is now commonly referred to as Final Fantasy VI, as to avoid confusion. There were no major gameplay changes, like previous games in the series, but much of the script was changed. The game's translator, Ted Woolsey, said that the Japanese version contained much ""playfulness and sexuality"" that couldn't be carried over due to Nintendo of America's strict guidelines.As is common in games, most of the names changed, for a variety of different reasons. Some names were changed because they broke the six character limit (Stragus to Strago), while others were changed to seem more exotic (Tina to Terra). Since the game came out before the ESRB ( Entertainment Software Ratings Board) was a standard, many changes had to be made due to sexual or violent content. The text files had to be shortened because of the limited space in the cartridge. It took Ted Woolsey only 30 days to complete the translation all by himself.Many of the sprites in the Japanese version of the game were bordering on nudity, so these were edited. The woman form of the Chadarnook was edited to cover up more of the skin, as was the Critic, Goddess, and Siren sprites. The sprites used in the final battle also differ; the Japanese version is much larger than the American version. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG GameFinal Fantasy VI has been re-released in various forms on a variety of systems after its original Super Famicom/SNES release. First, there was a technical demonstration based on the original Final Fantasy VI, called Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game. In the game, players controlled Terra, Locke, and Shadow in various battles by drawing patterns with a mouse, each pattern corresponding to a different move. The game was used to demonstrate the uses of SGI ( Silicon Graphics, Inc.) and a possible graphical direction for Square's next RPG. The technology was later put to use in Final Fantasy VII.Celes Chere in a CG trailer available in the PlayStation versionFinal Fantasy VI was also released three separate times for PlayStation: it was included in Final Fantasy Anthology (released on October 5, 1999) and Final Fantasy Collection (released only in Japan on March 11, 1999), and was also released as a standalone title (only in Japan and PAL regions). The game was left relatively unchanged, save for the addition of CG opening and closing cutscenes, and added load times before each of the game's many randomly triggered encounters. Other notable things included were a bestiary and artwork library that was accessible from the title screen. Various other things were added, such as new opening and closing effects to battles, the option to quicksave (although all saving still had to be initiated manually), and bug fixes although most of the bugs from the SNES version remained including the Mblock/Evade bug (as well as new bugs being created). The standalone edition of the game had a limited edition that shipped fifty-thousand copies and came with an alarm clock. Final Fantasy Anthology has an 80% rating on Metacritic and an 85% on GameRankings, gaining it the status of ""generally favorable reviews.""Title screen of Final Fantasy VI AdvanceFinal Fantasy VI Advance was released on the Game Boy Advance on November 30, 2006 in Japan, February 5, 2007 in North America, and June 29, 2007 in Europe. This version is more extensively changed than the PlayStation ports, but without the load times before each of the game's many randomly triggered encounters. New gameplay features, redone graphics, and a retranslated script are among the most notable things included. Four new Espers were included in the game (Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos), as well as two new locations: the Dragons' Den (which included a new boss, the Kaiser Dragon) and the Soul Shrine (in which players could battle enemies continuously). Three new spells are included in the game, and bugs from the original are fixed. A bestiary and music player are also included in the game. In addition, the boxart and game-related art has been redone as well, again by Yoshitaka Amano. One scene, in which Celes is beaten, has been removed from the game, presumably due to events in Japan at the time of release. The game was relatively well-received from both critics and fans alike; it holds a 92% average rating on Metacritic and a 91% average on GameRankings. </div>  <div> Optional/Secret Characters : An example of the overworldThe gameplay of Final Fantasy VI is similar to that of its predecessors and of other 16-bit Japanese RPGs. Player characters move about the game‚Äôs fictional setting, completing a story-fueled series of objectives: reaching a certain location, defeating a certain enemy, retrieving a certain item, solving a puzzle, figuring out what to do next, etc. The gameplay is often broken up by story and dialogue sequences, which advance the story through generally non-interactive conversations and events. Over the course of the game, the player-controlled party grows to include a handful of unique characters; this group acts as the primary perspective from which players view the unfolding plot. As they battle enemies (which are encountered at random and are unavoidable) these player characters gain EXP (experience points), which allow them to gain levels. Every time a character gains a level, his or her stats (attributes upon which combat capability depends) are raised, allowing the character to fight more powerful enemies more easily.There are four main screens in the game.In the overworld screen, the player party traverses an expansive land, moving between various locales (towns and dungeons). More parts of the overworld and more locales become accessible as the player makes progress through the game. The party is susceptible to randomly triggered battles in the overworld.Towns and dungeons are accessible from the overworld. In this screen, the player party moves about smaller-scale areas, interacting with NPCs and environmental objects. Towns generally include shops and inns, whose goods and services are bought with GP (currency). Towns are populated by numerous NPCs, with which the player can converse. Dungeons are more dangerous, as the party is vulnerable to enemy attacks while exploring them, due to randomly triggered encounters, and no shops or inns are found within. (Although Tents can be used at save points to replenish the party's health and magic, serving the same purpose as an inn.) Often contained in a dungeon is one of many powerful boss enemies, most of which must be fought in the course of the game. Dungeons are usually larger and more complexly designed than towns. Towns and dungeons are the primary settings for cutscenes and plot events.In the battle screen, the player controls the party as it fights against an enemy or enemies. The player enters the battle screen when a random or scripted battle is commenced, and exits by winning, fleeing, or losing the battle. (Losing a battle results in a game over, meaning that all the player's progress since their last save point is lost, and the player is sent back to the title screen without even being offered a chance to try that battle again). In battle, the player does not directly control character movement; instead, the player selects battle commands from menus unique to the individual party members.The menu screen is accessible from the overworld and town/dungeon screens. Here, the player can use items, manage party members‚Äô equipment and abilities, view their stats, change game settings, and save their progress. (which has to be done manually) </div>  <div> Other Notable Characters : A typical battle screen.Final Fantasy VI's battles (which are most often random) utilize the Active Time Battle system first implemented in Final Fantasy IV. Each character has his or her own action gauge, which fills up at a rate dependent on the character's speed stat. When the gauge is full, the character can perform actions chosen from his or her command list. Such actions include performing a basic attack, casting a magic spell, using an item, and drawing upon the unique ability of the character.Magic, as in all Final Fantasy games, can be used for a range of purposes. Primarily, spells are used to inflict damage, bestow status conditions (both positive and negative), and heal. To cast a spell, a character must use MP, which can be restored similarly to HP. If a character's current MP is lower than the MP cost of a spell, he or she will be unable to cast it. MP, like HP, is a stat; as it rises, the character's maximum MP count will rise.As in many Final Fantasy games, the combat screen is separated into one large rectangle on top, in which all the action takes place, and one smaller one at the bottom of the screen, in which the player inputs commands. Certain non-interactive cutscenes also take place on the combat screen, with characters displayed as battle sprites.When the party wins a battle, it gains EXP, GP, and (sometimes) AP (see the ""Equipment"" section below). Defeated enemies sometimes also drop items or equipment. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Browsing through items at an item storeThere is a lot of equipment in the game, providing for great lengths of customization. The right hand, left hand, head, and body can all be customized with a wide variety of weapons and armor. Weapons determine the nature of characters' physical attacks, while shields and armor boost their stats (primarily defense and magic defense). Generally, one hand holds a weapon, one hand holds a shield, the head holds headgear, and the body holds body armor. However, the Genji Glove and Gauntlet relics (see below) allow characters to break the rules regarding weapon-equipping.Relics are items that have effects less traditional than those of weapons and armor. Two can be equipped at once by each character, allowing them to bestow myriad potential bonus combinations. Examples of relics include the Sniper Sight (which ensures a 100% hit rate of basic attacks), the Black Belt (which grants a 50% chance of counterattacking against enemies' physical strikes), and the Alarm Earring (which prevents back attacks and pincer attacks). Relics can protect against various status conditions, bestow positive status conditions, change the nature of attacks or abilities, and boost stats. There are also relics that offer out-of-battle bonuses; for example, the Sprint Shoes double walking speed in towns and dungeons.Espers add a deep customization element to the game's magic system. Although they are not introduced particularly early in the game, they are an essential part of the game's character customization. Espers collected in their Magicite forms are the primary means by which characters learn magic spells. Each one has a unique set of spells, and each spell has a corresponding rate multiplier (a spell's multiplier usually varies between the different Espers that teach it). When a character has equipped an Esper (each character can equip one at a time), battling will further his or her learning of the Esper's spells: the number of AP (ability points) earned at the end of battle is multiplied by each spell's rate multiplier and added to the spell's growth percentage, which represents the character's learning progress. When the character's growth percentage for a spell reaches 100, he or she learns it. When the Esper is unequipped from the character, all its growth percentages (and availability of learned spells) remain; even if a percentage is lower than 100, the character can later continue adding to it by equipping another Esper (or the same Esper) with the given spell.Espers also feature as the game's summons. Each equipped Esper can be summoned once per battle to perform its unique spell; these summon spells are generally more powerful than most commonly learned magic. No AP growth is needed to perform summons.It should be noted that, due to the workings of the Magicite system, every character in the game (save Gogo and Umaro, who cannot equip Espers) can learn every spell, even though Terra and Celes are the only ones who can learn magic through leveling. </div> "

Square also published the game in Japan, but its release in North America and Europe was handled by Sony Computer Entertainment. The story follows Cloud Strife, an aloof mercenary hired by an eco-terrorist group known as AVALANCHE. This tiny resistance group struggles to protect their world (referred to simply as ""the Planet"" or ""Gaia"") from ruthless exploitation by the megacorporation Shinra, pitting the ex-SOLDIER Cloud and his companions against Shinra's heavily armed security forces.Final Fantasy VII is generally credited for popularizing the role-playing genre outside of Japan, thanks in part to its extensive use of pre-rendered cutscenes, and its overwhelming critical and commercial success helped to pave the way for the rise of cinematic storytelling in the video game industry. Because the game's pre-rendered video content requires a significant amount of storage space, the PlayStation release of Final Fantasy VII consists of three discs which are swapped-between at certain points over the course of the story.Final Fantasy VII has also been acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation, helping to cement Sony's dominant position over other fifth-generation console manufacturers. This was especially true in the case of Nintendo 64, as Final Fantasy VII first began development in 1994 as a Nintendo platform exclusive. However, due to the technical limitations and higher manufacturing costs associated with the N64's cartridge-based format, the game's development was eventually transitioned to Sony's PlayStation hardware, causing a rift between Square and Nintendo that put an end to their working relationship for several years afterward.A remake of the original game, Final Fantasy VII Remake, was released worldwide in 2020 for PlayStation 4. </div>  <div> Story : Midgar, the game's first major locationFinal Fantasy VII's opening cinematic depicts the disc-shaped city of Midgar, an industrialized dystopia built atop the convergence of several older villages (now known only as ""Sectors"") and powered by convenient Mako energy. The city is controlled by the Shinra Electric Power Company, an oppressive megacorporation headquartered in Midgar that leverages their global monopoly on basic utilities, as well as a powerful standing military, in order to exert their authority over much of the world's population. Shinra's Mako reactors create power by extracting ""Lifestream,"" the physical form of the Planet's spiritual energy, directly out of the earth. Their unchecked harvesting and conversion of Lifestream into expendable Mako energy has led to widespread ecological decay, potentially threatening all life on the Planet.The story follows detached ex-SOLDIER member Cloud Strife, a mercenary seeking employment in Midgar. He is hired by the tiny resistance group AVALANCHE, who set out to destroy Shinra's Mako reactors with guerrilla strikes in an attempt to slow the Planet's decay. Although their first two bombing missions succeed, Cloud is separated from his companions by a Shinra trap and falls into the Sector 5 slums located beneath a section of Midgar's upper plate. Here he meets a flower girl named Aerith Gainsborough, and after Cloud saves her from capture by the elite Shinra operatives known as the Turks, Aerith decides to accompany Cloud on his way back to AVALANCHE's hideout in Sector 7's slums. However, Shinra forces soon track down and eliminate most of the rebels by dropping an entire section of Midgar's upper plate onto Sector 7's slums, killing many innocent civilians in the process. Aerith is also abducted by Shinra during the attack. President Shinra believes that Aerith possesses special powers as the last surviving Cetra, and that she will help secure his company's future by leading Shinra to the mythical ""Promised Land,"" allegedly a source of boundless Mako energy.Surviving AVALANCHE members Tifa Lockhart and Barret Wallace join Cloud as he climbs up Midgar's supports to reach the towering Shinra Building at the city's center, where Aerith is being held as a test subject by the twisted Professor Hojo. After infiltrating Shinra headquarters and rescuing Aerith (as well as Red XIII, another test subject), Cloud reaches the top floor and discovers President Shinra's corpse with a long katana embedded in his back.Cloud and Tifa both recognize the sword as belonging to Sephiroth, Cloud's former commander in SOLDIER. Both party members are surprised by Sephiroth's appearance in Midgar, since he was declared ""missing in action"" and presumed dead after suddenly going rogue and razing Cloud's hometown of Nibelheim during a mission five years earlier. Escaping from the Shinra Building, Cloud's party leaves Midgar and chases after Sephiroth in order to prevent him from reaching the so-called Promised Land, as well as to take vengeance for Nibelheim's destruction.As Cloud and company pursue Sephiroth across the Planet, they eventually learn that Lifestream is not only the source of all life, but also acts as a sort of planetary immune system. When their world is severely ""injured"" by a cataclysmic event, an abundance of Lifestream energy coalesces around the injury to ""heal"" the Planet. It is revealed that Sephiroth plans to cause just such a catastrophe by summoning Meteor to crash into the Planet, allowing him to absorb the enormous amount of Lifestream energy gathered at the point of impact and gain the powers of a god. Sephiroth also brings to light a series of unsettling revelations about Cloud's past, causing Cloud to question his own memories and even his identity as an individual. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Although the game's audiovisual presentation is significantly updated, Final Fantasy VII hews fairly close to its role-playing precursors in terms of core gameplay. Players explore a large world with their party of one or more playable characters, fighting enemies in turn-based battles (many of which occur via random encounters) and interacting with NPCs via text-based dialogue. However, unlike its 2D predecessors in the same series, Final Fantasy VII is not strictly limited to an overhead perspective while exploring environments such as towns or dungeons, and often uses different fixed camera angles in the prerendered backgrounds that make up these areas. The game's discrete locales are connected by a fully 3D world map, and the battle screen is also rendered with full polygonal graphics.Combat employs an updated form of the same Active Time Battle system first introduced in Final Fantasy IV. By default, enemies will continue to attack regardless of whether any commands have been issued to party characters, requiring players to act quickly in executing their battle strategies. The maximum party size for Final Fantasy VII is limited to three characters, with main protagonist Cloud typically locked-in as a mandatory party member. </div>  <div> Characters : One of Final Fantasy VII's most notable new gameplay features is the Materia system. Throughout the game, the player's party can collect spheres of crystallized Mako called ""Materia"" containing the essence of magic, with a total of eighty-three different varieties of Materia in all. Most of the game's equippable weapons and armor feature slots into which Materia can be inserted, granting the wearer powerful spells or other special abilities. Just as in previous Final Fantasy titles, using spells and certain abilities in battle also requires MP.By wearing equipped Materia into battle, it can gain Ability Points (or ""AP"") and level-up just like a playable character, potentially unlocking new and stronger abilities. Once a single piece of Materia reaches its maximum level, it is ""Mastered"" and produces a copy of itself, which can be equipped and leveled-up in the same way. Certain pieces of equipment feature double or even triple ""growth rates"" for AP, allowing the wielder to level-up equipped Materia more quickly. Conversely, equipment with zero growth rates or even a total lack of Materia slots can also be found.Cloud using ""Ice2"" magic in combatSome equipment features pairs of ""linked"" Materia slots, which can allow compatible types of Materia to be paired together for increased effectiveness. For example, pairing a ""Lightning"" Materia with an ""All"" Materia allows the wearer to strike all enemies simultaneously with the elemental ""Bolt"" spell in a single turn. Certain advanced combinations of Materia can also be used by linking multiple copies of the same Materia (all equipped on the same character) to other compatible Materia types, often to devastating effect. For example, if a character pairs a ""Lightning"" Materia with ""All"" and a second copy of ""Lightning"" with ""HP Absorb,"" they will be able to cast ""Bolt"" on all foes while simultaneously regaining HP based on a percentage of the total damage inflicted.There are five different color-coded categories of usable Materia in Final Fantasy VII: Magic (green), Command (yellow), Summon (red), Support (blue) and Independent (purple). </div>  <div> Development : Green-colored Materia allows the wielder to cast magic, including healing, damage-dealing or status-inducing spells. With the exception of ""Master Magic,"" equipping Magic Materia also affects the wearer's attributes, typically lowering physically oriented stats such as Strength and HP while boosting Magic and MP.Several varieties of Magic Materia have associated elemental or status-effect properties, which can be only be utilized when the Materia is paired with either the ""Elemental"" or ""Added Effect"" Support Materia. While active on a weapon, these properties can add Elemental damage types to standard Attacks or gain a chance to inflict status effects; conversely, their presence on armor increases the wearer's resistance to the paired Elemental damage type or grants immunity to the paired status effect.MateriaSpellsStat ChangeBarrierBarrier (Lv.1): Sets Barrier status on one target (16 MP)MBarrier (Lv.2/5,000AP): Sets MBarrier status on one target (24 MP)Reflect (Lv.3/15,000AP): Sets Reflect status on one target (30 MP)Wall (Lv.4/30,000AP): Sets Barrier and MBarrier status on one target (58 MP)[Master] (Lv.5/45,000AP)MaxHP-5%Str -2Vit -1MaxMP+5%Mag +2Spr +1CometComet (Lv.1): 5x base non-elemental attack to one target (70 MP)Comet2 (Lv.2/12,000AP): 1.875x base non-elemental attack to four random targets (110 MP)[Master] (Lv.3/60,000AP)MaxHP-5%Str -2Vit -1MaxMP+5%Mag +2Spr +1ContainFreeze (Lv.1): 5.9375x base Ice-elemental attack, ~68% chance to inflict Stop (82 MP)Break (Lv.2/5,000AP): 6.25x base Earth-elemental attack, ~32% chance to inflict Petrify (86 MP)Tornado (Lv.3/10,000AP): 6.5625x base Wind-elemental attack, ~32% chance to inflict Confusion (90 MP)Flare (Lv.4/15,000AP): 7.1875x base Fire-elemental attack (100 MP)[Master] (Lv.5/60,000AP)Added Effect: Stop, Petrify, Confusion*Note: Incompatible with ""All"" MateriaMaxHP-10%Str -4Vit -2MaxMP+10%Mag +4Spr +2DestructDeBarrier (Lv.1): Removes Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect and Shield from one target (12 MP)DeSpell (Lv.2/5,000AP): Removes Barrier, MBarrier, Reflect, Shield, Haste, Slow, Stop, Regen, Death Force and Resist from one target (30 MP)Death (Lv.3/15,000AP): ~44% chance to inflict Death on one target;

With the exception of the ""Master Summon"" Materia (which does not gain AP or levels), every Summon Materia becomes Mastered at level five.As with Magic Materia, several varieties of Summon Materia have associated elemental or status-effect properties that can be applied to equipment, which can be only be utilized when the Materia is paired with either the ""Elemental"" or ""Added Effect"" Support Materia. While active on a weapon, these properties can add Elemental damage types to standard Attacks or gain a chance to inflict status effects; conversely, their presence on armor increases the wearer's resistance to the paired Elemental damage type or grants immunity to the paired status effect.MateriaLevel/APSpellsStat ChangeAlexanderLv.2/25,000Lv.3/65,000Lv.4/100,000Lv.5/150,000Judgement: 7.5x base Holy-elemental damage (120 MP)Elemental: HolyMaxHP-5%MaxMP+5%Mag +1Spr +1BahamutLv.2/35,000Lv.3/50,000Lv.4/80,000Lv.5/120,000Mega Flare: 4.0625x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage (100 MP)MaxHP-5% MaxMP+5%Mag +2Spr +1Bahamut ZEROLv.2/35,000Lv.3/120,000Lv.4/150,000Lv.5/250,000Tera Flare: 7.5x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage (180 MP)MaxHP-10%MaxMP+15%Mag +4Spr +4Choco/ MogLv.2/2,000Lv.3/14,000Lv.4/25,000Lv.5/35,000DeathBlow!!: 1x base non-elemental damage, ~40% chance to inflict Stop (14 MP)Fat Chocobo: 1.25x base non-elemental damage (14 MP)*Note: Summon uses one of two abilities; usually DeathBlow!!, with 6.25% chance for Fat Chocobo insteadMaxHP-2%MaxMP+2%Mag +1HadesLv.2/35,000Lv.3/120,000Lv.4/150,000Lv.5/250,000Black Cauldron: 5.625x base non-elemental damage; inflicts Poison, Sleep, Confusion, Silence, Frog, Small, Slow and Paralyzed (150 MP)Added Effect: Poison, Sleep, Confusion, Silence, Frog, SmallMaxHP-10%MaxMP+15%Mag +4Spr +4IfritLv.2/5,000Lv.3/20,000Lv.4/35,000Lv.5/60,000Hellfire: 1.6875x base Fire-elemental damage (34 MP)Elemental: FireMaxHP-2%MaxMP+2Mag +1KjataLv.2/22,000Lv.3/60,000Lv.4/90,000Lv.5/140,000Tetra-Disaster: 6.25x base Fire/Ice/Lightning-elemental damage (110 MP)MaxHP-5%MaxMP+5%Mag +2Spr +1Knights of RoundLv.2/50,000Lv.3/200,000Lv.4/300,000Lv.5/500,000Ultimate End: Thirteen attacks for 5x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage each (250 MP)MaxHP-20%MaxMP+25%Mag +8Spr +8LeviathanLv.2/18,000Lv.3/38,000Lv.4/70,000Lv.5/100,000Tidal Wave: 4.6875x base Fire/Ice/Lightning-elemental damage (110 MP)Elemental: WaterMaxHP-5%MaxMP+5%Mag +2Spr +1Neo BahamutLv.2/25,000Lv.3/65,000Lv.4/100,000Lv.5/150,000Giga Flare: 5x base non-elemental barrier-piercing damage (140 MP)MaxHP-10%MaxMP+10%Mag +2Spr +2OdinLv.2/16,000Lv.3/32,000Lv.4/65,000Lv.5/80,000Steel Bladed Sword: 92% chance to inflict Death on all enemies; always misses Undead (80 MP)Gunge Lance: 4.875x base non-elemental damage to one random target (80 MP)Added Effect: Death*Note: Summon always uses Steel Bladed Sword unless it would be ineffective against all enemies, in which case Gunge Lance is used insteadMaxHP-5%MaxMP+5%Mag +1Spr +1PhoenixLv.2/35,000Lv.3/120,000Lv.4/150,000Lv.5/250,000Phoenix Flame: 3.75x base Fire-elemental damage to all enemies (no split); revives any fallen party members with full HP (no split) (180 MP)Elemental: FireMaxHP-10%MaxMP+10%Mag +2Spr +2RamuhLv.2/10,000Lv.3/25,000Lv.4/50,000Lv.5/70,000Judgement Bolt: 1.875x base Lightning-elemental damage (40 MP)Elemental: LightningMaxHP-2%MaxMP+2%Mag +1ShivaLv.2/4,000Lv.3/15,000Lv.4/30,000Lv.5/50,000Diamond Dust: 1.5x base Ice-elemental damage (32 MP)Elemental: IceMaxHP-2%MaxMP+2%Mag +1TitanLv.2/15,000Lv.3/30,000Lv.4/60,000Lv.5/80,000Anger of the Land: 2.0625x base Earth-elemental damage (40 MP)Elemental: EarthMaxHP-2%MaxMP+2%Mag +1TypoonLv.2/35,000Lv.3/120,000Lv.4/150,000Lv.5/250,000Disintegration: 6.875x base Fire/Ice/Lightning/Earth-elemental barrier-piercing damage (160 MP)Elemental: WindMaxHP-10%MaxMP+10%Mag +4Spr +4Master SummonN/AEquips all Summon Materia summons with an infinite number of uses per battle (still requires MP)*Note: This Materia does not gain AP or levelsN/A </div>  <div> Availability on the PlayStation Network : Blue-colored Materia can be paired with Magic, Command or Summon Materia in order to enhance their capabilities.

Final Fantasy VIII,Square,"SCEEPAL, Square Co., Ltd.JP, Square Electronic ArtsUS","September 9, 1999",ps,"In the eighth numbered Final Fantasy title, Squall and his band of mercenaries fight to save their world from conquest and destruction. It introduced several new concepts to the franchise, including a subplot with an alternate main character, level-scaling enemies, and the Junction system.",3030-12277,12277,0,1999-02-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-viii/3030-12277/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Final Fantasy VIII is the eighth numbered console installment in the Final Fantasy franchise developed and published by Squaresoft (now Square Enix). It was initially released only on PlayStation in 1999 before later being ported to Windows-based PCs in 2000. Final Fantasy VIII carries the series' role-playing legacy forward with a number of elements found in previous games, as well as an improved polygonal 3D engine, new pre-rendered cutscenes and an expansive original story. The plot focuses on Squall Leonhart, a cadet training at the Balamb Garden military academy in order to join ""SeeD,"" Balamb's elite mercenary force. SeeD's involvement with a small resistance group struggling against the oppressive Galbadian government escalates into an international crisis in which Squall's relatively inexperienced squad must protect the world from the wrath of an evil sorceress. Along the way, the game's playable cast unravels their forgotten past while learning the values of friendship, compassion and sacrifice.Reception of Final Fantasy VIII was largely positive both critically and commercially. Even in the wake of the North American launch of the Dreamcast on the same day, Final Fantasy VIII became the top-selling video game in the US just two days after its release, and it held that position for more than three weeks. In the Japanese market, about 2.5 million copies were sold in the first four days after release. By the end of 1999, over six million copies had been sold worldwide. Despite Final Fantasy VIII's generally favorable reception, certain new features such as an overhauled magic system and level-scaling encounters were polarizing among players. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In terms of genre, Final Fantasy VIII is very similar to prior titles in the same series; players explore an expansive game world containing many NPCs with their party of one or more playable characters. The player's party fights enemies in turn-based battles, many of which occur via random encounters. It is most similar to its immediate predecessor Final Fantasy VII in the sense that all gameplay takes place on either the world map, a pre-rendered area or the battle screen. The world map is a zoomed-out view of the planet's surface which is disproportionate to the size of Squall's model, the sole character displayed on the overworld. Besides walking, the player's party can traverse the world map in several ways such as renting motor vehicles or a Chocobo mount; an airship also becomes available much later in the story. The game's more detailed pre-rendered areas are drawn proportionate to characters, and all current party members are shown in these areas at once. When an enemy is encountered, the general aesthetics of a particular pre-rendered area are carried over into a discrete fully 3D battle scene. </div>  <div> Characters : Junctioning magic to attributesPerhaps the most significant change to the gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII is the new ""Junction System,"" which effectively replaces the older titles' mechanic of equipping armor and accessories to gain higher attributes. Junctioning involves party members instead equipping themselves with the game's version of summons called ""Guardian Forces"" (or ""GFs"") which grant a character additional battle menu commands beyond the basic ""Attack"" option. Equipping one or more GFs also allows for enhancement of a character's basic attributes (HP, Strength, Vitality, etc.) by Junctioning magic spells to individual attributes.Magic also functions in an entirely different manner compared to prior Final Fantasy titles. There are no MP in Final Fantasy VIII; instead, magic spells are stored and expended per-use in a stock system as if they were items. The total stock for a given spell determines its effectiveness when Junctioned, and more powerful tiers of magic (i.e. Fira, Blizzaga, etc.) can potentially boost a character's attributes even higher. The specific attributes that can be Junctioned depend on which Guardian Forces are equipped to a character, as well as the Junctioned GFs' experience levels and learned abilities.Besides basic attributes, magic can also be Junctioned to a character's Status-Attack/Defense (ST-A/D) and Elemental-Attack/Defense (EL-A/D) attributes. Only magic which inflicts status effects can be Junctioned to the ST-Attack and ST-Defense attributes; for example, Junctioning Sleep magic to the ST-Attack attribute grants characters a chance to cast Sleep on an enemy simply by using their standard Attack command in battle. Conversely, Junctioning Sleep to ST-Defense gives characters a higher chance to avoid becoming inflicted with the same status themselves. EL-Attack and EL-Defense are Junctioned with elemental magic spells, giving characters the ability to deal elemental damage with basic attacks or resist incoming elemental damage more effectively. By increasing the EL-Defense stat beyond 100%, characters can even absorb particular types of elemental attacks to restore their health.Elvoret, an early boss fightIn the hands of a skilled player, effective use of Junctioning can obviate the need for playable characters to gain experience and level up. This ties into the fact that all of the game's enemy encounters are scaled in accordance with the party's current levels. Lower-level enemies (including bosses) have fewer available spells and are generally much weaker than they would be otherwise, making low-level playthroughs of Final Fantasy VIII not only viable, but potentially much easier than a ""standard"" playthrough. To further support low-level approaches, a special GF ability can be acquired that prevents nearly all random encounters, and the game's mandatory bosses do not grant any experience points upon defeat. </div>  <div> Guardian Forces : Drawing magic from enemiesAnother significant addition is one that also revolves around the use of magic. The draw system is a method of obtaining magic quite apart from the methods seen in Final Fantasy games up to this point. Magic, instead of being learned by characters as they level up, is obtained through the draw system. Magic can be drawn from enemies, but also from specific draw points dotted all over the world.Up to 100 items of any type of magic can be held at one time. The more items of a particular type of magic the player possesses, the more significant effect it will have when Junctioned. When in battle, drawing magic uses up a character's turn, and is not always successful. Some magic can only be obtained from monsters in battle, so it is often necessary to attempt drawing magic whenever a new foe is encountered to ensure that rare forms of magic are not missed.There are also invisible draw points throughout the world. While invisible, they can be heard by walking near them. An ability can be acquired from Siren that allows the player to see all invisible draw points throughout the journey, even when she isn't Junctioned to a character. </div>  <div> Low-Level Run : Limit Breaks also make a return to this iteration of the Final Fantasy series. Instead of Final Fantasy VII's trigger to limit breaks of a Limit meter filling through damage taken, the limit breaks in Final Fantasy VIII are triggered randomly, and are more likely when the character has critical life or is affected by status ailments. The buff spell ``Aura`` can be used to increase the frequency of the limit break being triggered, and allows for limit breaks to appear at any health level. The style of limit breaks varies from character to character, being a random slot machine style casting, to a fighting game combo system, or Squall's timing trigger Renzokuken. </div>  <div> Triple Triad Cards : Triple Triad is a card minigame in Final Fantasy VIII. Collecting cards is more than merely a fun break from the core narrative elements of the game, as powerful magic and items can be refined from some of the rarer cards, making it a worthwhile investment of time and resources. Triple Triad is played on a three by three grid, where cards of various characters and monsters from the game are laid. Each card has a number corresponding to each side of the card, ranging from one to nine, and A which is considered ten. The objective of the game is to lay cards as to beat the existing card on the grid with a higher number. Adjacent sides of the card are compared, and the card with the higher number will win. The ownership of the losing card will be lost on the grid and transferred to the winner. The initial turn is determined by a coin flip. The winner of the game is determined by the person with the highest number of cards owned on the grid. The prize for the winner is taking one or more cards from the loser. In addition to the standard rules, there can be additional rules depending on the region. </div>  <div> The PocketStation : Through an ability learned via junctioned Guardian Forces, characters can refine certain items into other items or spells. Several different refinement types exist, which bear different results when refining certain items: magic; healing potions; buff items; ammunition and equippable amulets are among the few types of things produced from a refinement. Different refinement ability types are learned from different Guardian Forces. For instance: Ifrit, who is a fire-based Guardian Force, learns Fire Magic Refinement. </div>  <div> Music : There are six main playable characters in Final Fantasy VIII. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Squall is the main protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. Squall is training to be a SeeD at Balamb Garden, and the game primarily follows Squall as he undertakes various missions in this mercenary role. He initially starts off as a quiet and reserved person, however the influence of characters such as Rinoa encourage him to come out of his shell. It is learned later on in the game that Squall, like a number of the other characters, was raised in an orphanage run by Matron. There are strong hints in the game to suggest that Squall is the son of Laguna. </div> "
Final Fantasy IX,Square,"SCEEPAL, Square Co., Ltd.JP, Square Electronic ArtsUS","November 13, 2000",ps,Zidane Tribal and his troupe attempt to abduct Princess Garnet of Alexandria in this throwback to the classics of the series.,3030-8825,8825,0,2000-07-07,https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-ix/3030-8825/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Final Fantasy IX was developed and published by Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix) in 2000 for Sony's PlayStation, though the PlayStation 2 was released in the same year. It was the third and last-numbered game in the series to be released on the console. Final Fantasy IX was later re-released on the PlayStation Network, along with the previous two entries in the series, before eventually receiving a PC port in 2016.While Final Fantasy IX was being developed at the same time as Final Fantasy VIII, the game took a different path towards returning to the series' roots, offering a more traditional fantasy setting while making multiple references to older games in the series, its primary influence being the original Final Fantasy. The game introduced many new features, such as Mognet, Active Time Events (ATE), and a revamped equipment and skill system. The game was initially shipped on four PlayStation discs, mostly due to the FMV cut scenes. Final Fantasy IX is known for having some of the best visuals of its generation. It sold better at its initial release than both of its PlayStation predecessors but, over time, has not fared quite as well. </div>  <div> Setting : GaiaFinal Fantasy IX takes place primarily in the four continents of the fantasy world Gaia. The majority of Gaia's population lives in the Mist Continent (named due to the thick layer of mist covering it). However, the small populations on the other three continents - Outer, Lost, and Forgotten - although these other continents are unexplored by those on the Mist Continent. The Mist Continent is divided into four major powers: Alexandria, Lindblum, Burmecia, and Cleyra, all separated by extensive mountain ranges.The game has a medieval fantasy setting, unlike its predecessors - Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. The setting has more in common with older Final Fantasy games. The population relies on hydropower and wind power, though it also learns to harness the mist covering the Mist Continent to power more advanced engines, such as those found on airships. According to Hiroyuki Ito (the game's director), Gaia is influenced by Norse and Northern European Mythology, as the development team is attracted to the drama and depth presented by them. </div>  <div> Story : Queen Brahne Raza Alexandros XVI of the kingdom of Alexandria lusts for power and seeks to increase her domain by conquering the surrounding lands. However, Regent Cid of Lindblum worries how this will impact Princess Garnet and dispatches the Tantalus Theater Troupe to kidnap her.The princess yearns to escape from her wicked mother and willingly boards the Theater Ship. During the operation, Vivi, a lone black mage, and Adelbert Steiner, Captain of the Royal Knights of Pluto, become involved. Unfortunately, the Theater Ship is shot down during their escape and crashes into the Evil Forest. Brahne is outraged that Garnet escaped with a valuable crystal, a royal heirloom, and dispatches the Black Waltzes to retrieve her.One of the Tantalus members, Zidane, wants to find the missing princess, but their leader, Baku, dissents and dismisses Zidane from Tantalus. Vivi and Steiner join Zidane in rescuing Garnet from the forest's carnivorous flora and escape the woods, leaving Tantalus behind. The escapade rouses the forest made sentient by the Mist and petrifies itself. Mist is a malevolent substance whose influence hardens people's hearts and makes regular animals ferocious monsters. It covers the lower reaches of the Mist Continent, and thus most kingdoms opt to build their empires on the plateaus above it.A Tantalus member, Blank, wishes to aid Zidane, but when delivering him a map of the rarely-traversed surface of the Mist Continent, he gets caught by the forest vines and petrified along with the woods. Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and Steiner pass through the Ice Cavern to get above the Mist, and Zidane defeats Black Waltz 1, Brahne's lackey sent to retrieve Garnet's royal pendant. Before arriving in the village of Dali, Garnet adopts the alias of ""Dagger"" to blend in with the peasantry. Unfortunately, the villagers kidnap Vivi, and the party is shocked when they rescue him and discover the villagers are manufacturing black mages. These automaton dolls cast powerful magic from the Mist for export to Alexandria.Garnet ponders returning to Alexandria to confront her mother about the black mage business, a notion Steiner approves of. After besting Black Waltz 2, they board a cargo ship piloted by automaton black mages. They come under fire from Black Waltz 3, and Vivi, Zidane, and Steiner confront the golem leaving the journey's destination in Garnet's hands. The princess hesitates but ultimately decides to head for Lindblum, resulting in an erratic flight through the South Gate, crashing the Black Waltz's airship.The four meet with Regent Cid in Lindblum. They are surprised to find he has been turned into an oglop, an insect most find disgusting, by a magic spell from his absconded wife, Hildagarde Fabool. Cid refuses to mobilize against Alexandria for fear of leaving his borders unprotected. While Lindblum hosts the Festival of the Hunt, Brahne's black mage army advances into Burmecia, home of Zidane's friend Freya Crescent who aids him during the festival. Zidane wants to accompany Freya to Burmecia, and Vivi wishes to learn more about the black mages; he has no memory of his past beyond being cared for by his late ""grandpa"" Quan and fears he may not be human.Cid orders Garnet to remain in Lindblum. In retaliation, she tampers the festival feast with sleeping weed and absconds with Steiner back to South Gate. The others venture to Burmecia, recruiting the gluttonous Quina Quen along the way. They find Burmecia abandoned and decimated by Brahne's black mage army. They meet the queen and General Beatrix at the city apex and a mysterious man named Kuja. Beatrix defeats Zidane's group, and Brahne sets her sights on the isolated kingdom of Cleyra.Meanwhile, Garnet and Steiner run into Marcus from Tantalus, who wants to save his friend Blank from the Evil Forest, but needs an item known as Supersoft to heal his petrification. Garnet feels culpable for Blank's fate and agrees to help Marcus's quest, much to Steiner's dismay. However, the three are attacked by the malfunctioning Black Waltz 3 and destroy him for good before making their way to the city of Treno, where they sneak into the basement of a noble's mansion. The noble turns out to be Garnet's old tutor, Doctor Tot, who relinquishes the Supersoft willingly and advises the three to take the Gargan Roo pathway to Alexandria, where Garnet meets with her mother and Marcus and Steiner are imprisoned.Zidane, Freya, Vivi, and Quina head for Cleyra, where the Burmecians are said to have evacuated. They make their way into the city perched atop a colossal tree hidden behind a perpetual sandstorm. They warn the Cleyrans of the impending attack, and the Cleyrans perform a ritual to strengthen the sandstorm that protects the village. Unfortunately, something goes wrong, and the sandstorm dissipates. Brahne has turned on the princess and ordered Garnet's Eidolons extracted‚Äîmagical creatures of legend. The queen's court jesters, Zorn and Thorn, extract Garnet's Eidolons into summoning gems, and Brahne uses the Eidolon Odin to obliterate Cleyra after Beatrix steals the nation's jewel. Zidane's crew hitches a ride on the Alexandrian airship, Red Rose, back to Alexandria Castle, leaving Quina behind.Steiner and Marcus have broken free from imprisonment, with Marcus departing for the Evil Forest to save Blank. Zidane's party joins forces with Steiner, and they free Garnet from Brahne's clutches with the assistance of the enlightened Beatrix. While Steiner, Beatrix, and Freya stay behind to secure their escape, Zidane, Vivi, and Garnet attempt to use the Gargant system to flee to Treno. A monster spooks their ride and crashes in Pinnacle Rocks, where they meet the Eidolon Ramuh. Having again lost Garnet, who still holds the royal pendant, Brahne hires two bounty hunters‚ÄîLani and Amarant‚Äîto capture her and kill Vivi, whom Brahne considers a rogue black mage.Garnet is ambivalent about the power of Eidolons that had remained latent within her without her knowledge and that have now been stolen to be used by Brahne. After passing Ramuh's trial, giving Garnet the power to summon him, the three witness the invasion of Lindblum by a black mage army and another Eidolon, Atomos. Sneaking into the surrendered city, Zidane and Garnet meet with the now powerless Regent Cid, who reveals that Kuja is supplying Brahne with the black mages. It is rumored that the origin of Mist, the main ingredient in black mage production, lies in the Outer Continent, and the party sets off to locate Kuja there.They run into Quina at Qu's Marsh, who had escaped Cleyra and returned to his/her home. Quina helps the party locate Fossil Roo's entrance, an ancient route that leads to the Outer Continent. Lani accosts the party on her quest to retrieve the princess, but they defeat her. On the Outer Continent, the party finds the Black Mage Village, where many sentient black mages like Vivi live, having defected from the Alexandrian army and founded a settlement far away from conflict. Vivi discovers that black mages have a lifespan of about one year, and many of the earliest builds of black mages have already started to ""stop.""After passing through the dwarves' village of Conde Petie, they meet Eiko Carol, a young girl and the last of the summoner tribe, who leads the party to her home of Madain Sari. They find Madain Sari is a ruined village where Eiko lives alone with a group of moogles. Garnet learns the truth of her past: she is a summoner born in Madain Sari, but in the aftermath of the village's destruction ten years ago, she had washed up in Alexandria, where she had replaced the recently deceased Princess Garnet. Having lost her memories in the calamity, Garnet was raised believing Queen Brahne was her mother, never having learned she possessed Eidolons.Zidane convinces Eiko to open the path to the Iifa Tree, a giant tree that towers over the landscape and is mysteriously shrouded in Mist despite the remaining continent being free. The group descends the trunk to the core of Gaia, where they encounter Soulcage, who reveals the Mist's real purpose: Mist is the by-product of the Iifa Tree's actual function, stopping Gaian souls from returning to their Crystal in the planet's core. The discarded souls are released as Mist on the Mist Continent via the Iifa Tree's roots covering the whole planet within its crust. The malevolent substance is responsible for the monsters that roam the continent's depths and incited war among the nations until Mist-powered airships were invented.Upon Soulcage's defeat, the Mist dissipates, and the heroes return to Madain Sari, where they find the bounty hunter Lani and her brooding companion Amarant. Upon finding an identical crystal in Madain Sari to that of Garnet's royal pendant, Lani takes Eiko hostage. Amarant no longer tolerates her methods, turns against her, drives her away, and joins Zidane's party.They leave Quina in Madain Sari, return to the Iifa Tree, and find Kuja. Queen Brahne and her navy appear off Iifa's coast to challenge him, as Brahne no longer considers him useful, having attained the power of Eidolons. Kuja summons his Silver Dragon and monsters of Mist to repel her, and Brahne retaliates by summoning Bahamut. Kuja calls the airship Invincible to enslave it. Under Kuja's command, Bahamut wipes out Brahne and her soldiers and black mages with a devastating Mega Flare.A dying Brahne washes up on the shore and, with her final words, apologizes to Garnet, who must now become the queen of Alexandria. Alexandrian forces retreat from Lindblum, and Garnet inherits her mother's jewels from the kingdoms she had conquered. Garnet shares the jewels with Eiko‚Äîeach keeping two‚Äîto reinforce their bond as the last of the summoner tribe. Zidane is distraught; he must part with Garnet, for whom he had begun to have feelings, and departs to Treno with the others to participate in a Tetra Master tournament.The ceremonies of Garnet's coronation are short-lived as Kuja summons Bahamut to destroy Alexandria. The others fly in from Treno with Regent Cid's experimental airship, the Hilda Garde II, which can operate without Mist. Eiko and Garnet bring together the fragments of the ancient divided summoning gem, the real reason Brahne kept pursuing Garnet's royal pendant, and summon Alexander, the holy Eidolon guardian of Alexandria, that vanquishes Bahamut. In awe of its power, Kuja calls for the airship Invincible to enslave it. A mysterious older man appears aboard the Invincible, reproaches Kuja for his rebellion, and destroys Alexander and most of the city. Kuja, left without an Eidolon, flees.Garnet is rendered mute by the trauma of seeing her kingdom decimated, and she, Zidane, and their friends, now including Steiner and Freya, take refuge in Lindblum. Unfortunately, Cid's mind is different than what it used to be as an oglop, and thus his newest airship, the Hilda Garde II, needs to be better designed. The party sets to find a cure for Cid but turns him into a frog. Finally, the party is reunited with Quina, who has washed ashore in Lindblum, and Cid gives the party the ship Blue Narciss to track down Kuja, accompanying them on their quest.They stop by the Black Mage Village and discover that Kuja has tricked the black mages into following him, claiming he knows how to extend their lifespan. Knowing where Kuja resides, the group infiltrates his Desert Palace but falls into a trap and becomes imprisoned. Kuja forces Zidane and three of his friends to fly to the Forgotten Continent and retrieve the Gulug Stone from Oeilvert in exchange for the life of their other friends. It turns out Kuja possesses Hilda Garde I, Cid's new airship model that can fly without Mist, that Hilda took when she left him after turning him into an oglop.Oeilvert is an ancient archive from a lost Terran civilization with many artifacts, including an ancient Eidolon, Ark, which must be defeated to obtain the Gulug Stone. To Zidane's surprise, only he can decipher Terra's language though he has never heard of this other world.Meanwhile, Regent Cid and the remaining party members break free and shut down the palace security system, Valia Pira. Kuja snatches the Gulug Stone from Zidane and absconds with an abducted Eiko to Mount Gulug, where Kuja wishes to obtain an Eidolon stronger than Alexander. He believes this would let him defeat Garland, the older man who had appeared aboard the Invincible. The heroes pass through Esto Gaza to track him down and witness Zorn and Thorn‚ÄîBrahne's jesters who now obey Kuja‚Äîattempt to extract Eiko's Eidolons, although she is too young to withstand the ritual. Mog, Eiko's pet moogle, reveals her true Eidolon form through Trance, a surge of powerful emotions that momentarily enhances one's inner capabilities. With her help, the court jesters are destroyed.Having witnessed the power of Trance, Kuja deduces he does not need a new Eidolon after all. Unable to naturally enter Trance, Kuja formulates a plan to assimilate enough souls to enter a permanent Trance; as Kuja is a Genome initially constructed as a vessel for Terran souls, he can absorb them and wishes for all the gathered souls to enter Trance to become all-powerful simultaneously. While Kuja flees, Zidane's party finds Queen Hilda, Cid's estranged wife, who fled Lindblum after an argument with her husband and escorts her back to Lindblum.Hilda makes amends with Cid and turns him back into a human. Cid puts the finishing touches on his new airship, the Hilda Garde III. The black mages realized Kuja was using them and returned to the Black Mage Village. Garnet returns to Alexandria to visit her mother's resting place. When Zidane follows her, she recovers from her silence, takes his dagger, and cuts off her ponytail in a promise to continue to fight for her people and her adoptive mother.After she went missing, Kuja abducted Queen Hilda as he needed her airship, the first Hilda Garde. While captive, she learns of his plans and tells the party of Kuja's ambitions and that he hails from Terra. She directs them towards Ipsen's Castle on the Forgotten Continent. The party finds four elemental mirrors within the inverted structure: seals to the portal to Terra. After defeating the worm-like Taharka and rescuing Amarant from his arrogance, Zidane forms four parties to secure each elemental shrine simultaneously. The defeat of the four guardians and the placing of the mirrors in the shrines open Terra's path through the Shimmering Island.Terra is a mysterious dead planet that exists on the inside of Gaia. Millennia ago, Terra had an advanced magical civilization, and its inhabitants wished to become immortal and preserve their culture for all time. The life source of all planets in the cosmos is a crystal at the planet's core that collects all living beings' memories when the souls of the dead return to it at their life's end. Terrans' wish for immortality disrupted the natural order, and when the Terran Crystal weakened, the Terrans assimilated other planets' crystals to preserve themselves.Thousands of years ago, Terra attempted to fuse with Gaia, but it ended in disaster, and Terra shifted to the inside of the planet of Gaia. Terra's red moon moved to Gaia's orbit, and many Terran landmarks appeared on Gaia, such as Terra's magical tree of Iifa and Oeilvert. Terrans tasked the android Garland, the older man who annihilated Alexandria and whom Kuja wishes to vanquish, to become the overlord of Terra and Gaia both, restoring Terra to its former glory before entering a deep rest. Garland crafted the Genomes to be used as vessels for the Terran souls when it would be suitable for Terra to assimilate Gaia, whose Crystal has been deprived of its natural soul cycle by the Iifa Tree for thousands of years. Kuja was one of Garland's creations whom he sent to Gaia to incite a war to amplify the souls' rate to attempt to return to the Crystal. Kuja's will was strong, and he rebelled against his creator, knowing that if Garland's plans were to succeed, he would no longer need Kuja and make him into a regular Genome.In Terra, the party meets the Genome girl Mikoto who leads the party to the Genome village of Bran Bal. Garnet glimpses the Invincible stationed outside the village, reclaim memories of when the airship destroyed Madain Sari, and passes out. While the others care for her, Mikoto tells Zidane he is a Genome from Terra made by Garland to one day succeed Kuja, as after Kuja was created, Garland had seen the errors in his design of having created him as an adult, rather than as a child capable of emotional growth. She leads Zidane to Garland, who confirms everything, and horrified by what he has learned, Zidane attempts to fight him. Garland reluctantly decides to discard Zidane, make him a regular Genome and seal him within the Pandemonium, a palace where the ancient Terran souls rest. Garland fails to remove Zidane's soul, and Zidane's friends free him, and they confront Garland together.Kuja has followed the party into Terra on his Silver Dragon and stolen the Invincible. He showcases his new mastery of Trance, achieved by draining the souls held within the airship and using the soul of a hateful person‚ÄîQueen Brahne‚Äîas a catalyst. Kuja dispatches the party with an Ultima spell and announces he will rule both Terra and Gaia. Garland warns him that his power is meaningless, but Kuja kicks his old master off Pandemonium's precipice to his death.Garland remains an omniscient voice and, from beyond the grave, tells Kuja his new-found goal is for naught; a limit on his lifespan was set when he was created, and his demise is fast approaching. Kuja's euphoria turns into rage, and in his vanity, he deduces that if he is going to die, he will take the world with him. Kuja obliterates Terra with wave after wave of Ultima spells, and the party and resident Genomes escape aboard the Invincible back through the Shimmering Island to Gaia. Unfortunately, the Mist has returned to the world, now enveloping the entire planet, flowing once more from the Iifa Tree.While the Genomes move in with the black mages in their village, the party finds the foreboding entrance to Memoria hovering above the Iifa Tree, where Gaia's memories and Kuja await. The armies of Alexandria and Lindblum stave off the horde of Silver Dragons, blocking Memoria's entryway, and Invincible breaks through, carrying the party into Memoria, which leads them back in time. Memoria is a place made manifest from the memories stored within Gaia's Crystal, and the party witnesses the significant moments of their lives intertwined with the earliest stirrings of Gaia. Garland's lingering voice guides them through the dimension before leaving them at the Crystal World entrance, a realm where time does not exist, only memories of every life originating from the first Crystal, where all planets are born from.After traveling through Memoria to the beginning of all time to the Crystal that is the universe's life source, they find Kuja, intent on destroying it. Zidane and his friends face Kuja in battle, and in the last effort, Kuja devastates the party with Ultima. The party awakes on the Hill of Despair, finding themselves in the presence of Necron. It is a deity-like being roused by Kuja's nihilism that arises to deny all existence by returning the world to the Zero World, a world without a Crystal, as he sees the suffering of living beings arising from their fear of death. The party defeats Necron, who marvels at the party's will to persist, even knowing they cannot escape death and heeding their desire and departs.Kuja uses the last of his strength to teleport the heroes onto the banks of the Iifa Tree. The others return to Alexandria on Cid's Hilda Garde III while Zidane searches for Kuja. He locates Kuja deep within the dying Iifa Tree, and as the latter accounts for his sins, the collapsing tree's roots converge on them both.Sometime later, Tantalus returns to Alexandria to perform ""I Want to Be Your Canary"" for Queen Garnet. Vivi has died, having come to the end of his lifespan, but as a legacy, copies of him have been made, now known as ""Vivi's sons."" However, Vivi cannot say goodbye to Zidane; he reminiscences his time with the party in a soliloquy, thanking Zidane for helping him come to terms with his existence.Everyone gathers up in Alexandria to see the play, Freya has found her lost love, Sir Fratley, and the two repair their relationship despite Fratley's amnesia. Amarant arrives with Lani, Quina works as a chef in the Alexandria Castle, and Cid and Hilda have adopted Eiko. Beatrix and Steiner, now a couple, act as Garnet's bodyguards and accompany her on the balcony where she watches the play. During the play, a shrouded form masquerades as Marcus casts off his cloak to reveal a returning Zidane. Alexandria celebrates, old friends cheer from the stands, and the queen runs through the crowd and leaps into Zidane's arms. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Final Fantasy IX plays out like any other game in the series. The protagonist moves throughout the many towns, dungeons, caverns, and the like, exploring different areas and interacting with non-playable characters (NPCs). A field icon with a ""!"" or a ""?"" indicates that an object can be inspected or that there is either an item, a switch, a chest, or something similar nearby. This time around, the player can save their game and use tents to recover HP and MP by speaking to Moogles, whereas Save Points were used in previous games. The Moogles may also ask Zidane to deliver messages as a part of Mognet.As usual, different modes of transport are also available later on in the game, such as Chocobos, boats, and Airships. When traveling on foot on the world map or in places that contain monsters, the player will face random encounters.The new feature, Active Time Events (ATE), has many purposes. ATE's primary purpose is for additional character development, as it shows events that coincide with the main adventure. It is also used to provide unique items or control two different parties when the group is split up to solve puzzles and navigate dungeons.Final Fantasy IX retains the active time battle system that originated in Final Fantasy IV. The system is based on a time meter given to each character and monster participating in the battle. The time gauge will fill, and once full, the character can act. The speed that the gauge fills is related to each character's speed stat. During their turn, characters can perform several actions, with more advanced actions being character-specific. The basic actions include attack and item. Individual characters will have specific, advanced commands which make each unique and useful in their own way. Zidane has the ""Steal"" command, which takes an item from the enemy, and the ""Skill"" command allows the player to select one of many unique abilities. Other characters can use magic, summon, and eat. One of the unique commands is a dual-command in which Vivi and Steiner can attack simultaneously for a devastating attack.Final Fantasy IX introduces a new ""Trance"" system in battles. Each character has a Trance gauge that slowly fills battle after battle every time that character is attacked. Once it is filled, the character will go into a trance. Trance increases attack and defense and grants special, powerful commands. Zidane's Trance increases the potency of his abilities, and Dagger and Eiko's summons all become much more powerful. Once in Trance, the trance gauge will empty any time the character acts. When it reaches zero (usually within a few turns), the character will return to normal. Trance can be canceled out if the character in Trance dies or is inflicted with Zombie status. The trance system was often criticized for how hard it was to utilize effectively. Often, players would trance in insignificant battles and would be unable to Trance when they most needed it.Status ailments return, with old favorites like Poison and Sleep and some newcomers like Heat, which will cause a character to die if they act. The effects are canceled with Esuna or other magical spells, items or upon entering Trance.Each character has several stats that directly impact their performance in battle. Attack, strength, and magic will affect both physical and magical attack power. Defense and magic defense affect defense against physical and magical attacks, and evade and magic evade will increase the chances of dodging an attack. Spirit influences all aspects of the character, raising attack, defense, the success rate of special skills, and the rate at which the Trance gauge fills. Finally, the speed rating will allow the ATB gauge to fill faster. Upon leveling up, a character's stats will increase. </div>  <div> Abilities : Final Fantasy IX revives the concept of fixed character classes, where different characters are assigned a different class. For example, Zidane is the only character capable of using Thief techniques (stealing, etc.), while Freya is the only character capable of using Lancer/Dragoon techniques (Jumping, etc.).To learn new abilities, characters must equip different items which come with special abilities attached. Once equipped, the characters can use these abilities (as long as the ability matches their class), and after each battle, they gain Ability Points (AP). Once the character gains enough AP, the ability becomes usable without the item having to be equipped.Abilities are separated into action and support categories. Action abilities use up MP and include magic spells and special actions that can be used during battle to harm foes, heal allies, etc. Support abilities only become available when they are equipped with magical stones and have the ability to neutralize status effects, increase attack power, etc. The maximum number of stones that can be equipped increases as the characters level up. </div>  <div> Characters : Zidane Tribal: A blond thief with a monkey tail. He is a member of the Tantalus, a group of thieves/actors. He is a lighthearted, dagger-wielding chick lover who bears a much more sinister past and purpose. When tranced, he can access his Dyne abilities.Garnet Til Alexandros XVII (alias: Dagger, birth name: Sarah): The Princess of Alexandria, a beautiful black-haired girl. She is mostly a Summoner class (her normal summon command is ""Summon,"" but when tranced, it becomes ""Eidolon"" and guarantees the creature's appearance). However, she also has powerful White Magic at her disposal. Additionally, she can wield both rods and rackets.Vivi Orunitia: A young Black Mage child is trying to find the major answers in life while trying to understand his existence and life. Very shy, quiet, humble, and kind, he also controls powerful Black Magic (which becomes Double Black when tranced). Vivi also equips staves for a physical attack.Adelbert Steiner: He is the Captain of the Knights of Pluto, who serve in Alexandria. He is a protector of Princess Garnet and a man with a high sense of justice. He is also very stubborn and sometimes very square-minded. Swords are his weapons of choice, which grant him great physical strength (which is even more remarkable when tranced).Amarant Coral: He is a bounty Hunter and a wanted man. He and Zidane have a past together, where Zidane is instead humorously the cause of Amarant's criminal reputation. He is quiet, and nobody knows the reasons or thoughts behind his actions. His primary weapons are claws and his monk-like ""Flair"" abilities, gaining the ability to use them on all allies or enemies while in a trance state.Freya Crescent: A female Dragon Knight from the kingdom of Burmecia is in search of her lost love, Fratley. She is strong, smart, and brave. Her primary weapons are spears, which she uses to jump in the air, coming down upon her enemies with a powerful blow (or several powerful blows while tranced).Quina Quen: A bizarre-looking guy (or girl), he is part of the Qu race. He is sent by his ‚Äúmaster‚Äù to join Zidane and the rest of the party to learn about food and life around the world and become a great cook. His weapon of choice: giant forks. As part of her quest to eat all the foods in the world, Quina can eat enemies with 1/8 HP (sometimes learning powerful Blue Magic) or enemies with 1/4 HP during trance.Eiko Carol: A six-year-old girl living in Madain Sari, the lost village of the Eidolon summoners. She is one of the two remaining summoners in Gaia (the other being Garnet) but is more of a White Mage than a Summoner; when in trance, her White Magic becomes Double White. She wields both her summoner's flutes and rackets. She also has a big crush on Zidane and feels rivaled by Zidane's desire for Garnet. </div>  <div> Mini Games : Queen Brahne: Queen of Alexandria and mother of Garnet. She is a cruel and warmongering ruler, taking over the entire Mist Continent and having ambitions for the entire planet of Gaia.Kuja: The primary antagonist. He is an Angel of Death created on Terra to help cause deaths that would cycle souls to the dying planet and revive it. Upon seeing Trance, he yearns for the power, eventually gaining it and using it to obliterate the planet of Terra and nearly destroy all of existence.Beatrix: Introduced as a major antagonist, Beatrix eventually becomes an ally to the player (the player even controls her for a small number of battles). She is a very skilled swordswoman, the most famous warrior known on the planet. She challenges the party three times before finally joining them to stop Brahne. Beatrix is Steiner's love interest, and she wields the powerful ""Save the Queen"" sword, which only she can wield (even if the player does somehow acquire it).Regent Cid: Garnet's uncle and Regent (ruler) of the kingdom of Lindblum. When he first appears in the game, he is an Oglop. Later he is transformed into a frog, as opposed to the human form he had hoped for. Eventually, he is turned back into a man by his long-lost wife, Hilda. One of the party's best allies during the game. </div>  <div> Advertising : Blank: Friend of Zidane's and Member of Tantalus who took a part in the plot to kidnap Princess Garnet. Also, instrumental in the escape from the Evil Forrest.Marcus: Lead character in the play I Want to be Your Canary, performed by Tantalus Group and a close friend of Zidane's.Cinna: Part of Tantalus and the kidnapping scheme of Princess Garnet. He is known to be sensitive about his features.Beatrix: World-renowned general of the Alexandrian forces and love interest for Steiner. </div>  <div> PlayOnline : Terra MasterJump ropeChocobo hot and coldFrog catchingRagtime MouseHippaul racingGambling Nero brothersBlack Jack </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Final Fantasy IX was delayed, and in the months leading up to the release, Square signed a deal with Coca-Cola.

Final Fantasy Tactics,SquareSoft,"SquareSoftJP, SCEANA","January 28, 1998",ps,Final Fantasy Tactics is an isometric turn-based strategy game with RPG elements set in the world of Ivalice. It follows the plight of Ramza Beoulve on his quest to obtain the 12 Zodiac Brave stones and stop the corrupt Church of Glabados from unleashing an ancient evil.,3030-19864,19864,0,1997-06-20,https://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-tactics/3030-19864/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Final Fantasy Tactics is a strategy role-playing game that was released by Square Enix (formerly Squaresoft) for the PlayStation in January of 1998. While the game is part of the Final Fantasy franchise, its gameplay pays more homage to the tactical RPG Tactics Ogre than any of its brethren. However, the game retains a number of Final Fantasy related features such as chocobos, magic and a job system, incorporating these into the turn-based strategy premise. The game was re-released with an enhanced feature set for the PlayStation Portable in 2007 under the title Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Final Fantasy Tactics' gameplay revolves primarily around the strength of its battle system. Most of the time in game is spent fighting either scripted story-driven battles or random encounters. The rest is devoted to character development, negotiating the world map and following the game's labyrinthine plot. </div>  <div> Jobs : Final Fantasy Tactics' battle system takes the familiar traits of the core series' battle mechanics and mixes them with a traditional turn-based-strategy style of gameplay. Battles are fought in 3D isometric environments, with both the player's troop of soldiers and the band of enemies represented by 2D sprites commonly referred to as ""units"". </div>  <div> Primary Player Characters : Between battles, like most Final Fantasy games, Final Fantasy Tactics provides the player with a world map to traverse. FF Tactics' 2D world map functions more as a menu, as the player does not have active control over the on-screen character. Instead, the character can be moved to any available location on the world map using an icon. There are two primary types of locations on FF Tactics' world map, the first of which is towns. When the player visits a town, he or she has the option to:Visit the local Tavern, catch up on recent Gossip and possibly undertake an Errand.Stop at the Outfitter to buy and sell weapons, armor and other items.Pass by the Warriors' Guild to recruit new soldiers.Exclusive to certain locations, visit the Poachers' Den to buy poached items at reduced prices. </div>  <div> Secondary Player Characters : The Job System.Like most Final Fantasy games, there is a unique system in place that determines how your magic, abilites, and stats work. The basis of combat revolves around the Job System, a class-based concept that has you changing jobs, and using said actions of that class on the battlefield, which will yield you Job Points (JP). As you gain JP you will level up your specific class of character, as well as gain the right to unlock new abilities, by expending these points. Familiar character classes from past Final Fantasy games appear in this game as jobs, including Wizards, Priests, Thieves, Lancers, and Summoners. Most new characters start out as either a Squire or a Chemist, and work their way up the proverbial ladder, to unlock new Jobs -- and likewise -- new bone-crushing skills. </div>  <div> Story : SquireSquire is the base job from which all physical classes grow. While their abilities allow them to perform a wide variety of tasks, they are not particularly adept at any of them. However, they have access to a number of useful passive skills, including JP Boost and Move +1, that make it worthwhile for any character regardless of how they plan to eventually specialize.Prerequisites: NoneWeapons: Axes, Flails, Knives, SwordsArmor: Hats, ClothesMove/Jump Rate: 4/3Evasion Rate: 5%Active Stats: Phys - C; Mag - D; HP - C; MP - D; Spd - CGrowth Rate: Phys - D; Mag - D; HP - C; MP - F; Spd - FFundaments (job skill)NameDescriptionRangeAreaDelayJPFocusIncreases physical attack power by 1 until end of battle01Now300RushPhysical attack with high chance of knock-back11Now80StoneRanged physical attack41Now90SalveRemoves Blind, Poison, Silence11Now150ReactionNameDescriptionTriggerJPCounter TackleAttacks with Rush regardless of abilityPhysical attack180SupportNameDescriptionJPEquip AxesEquip Axes regardless of Job170BeastmasterGrants adjacent friendly monsters within 3H an additional ability200DefendAdds the Defend command, doubles evasion rate until next turn50JP BoostIncreases the amount of JP earned by 50%250MovementNameDescriptionJPMove +1Increases maximum movement range by 1200 </div>  <div> Setting : ChemistUnlike most Final Fantasy games, Chemists are the only job in Final Fantasy Tactics with the skill to use items.

The game features three main game modes: Career, Quick Race and Head to Head. In Career Mode you purchase a vehicle and start climbing the charts by winning races and earning money, which you can use to upgrade your vehicle or buy a new one. This is the main mode of the game, which allows you to unlock all the hidden cars it has. In Quick Race, you just set up a race in any track with any of the vehicles you¬¥ve unlocked and race for fun. Finally, Head to Head is a multiplayer mode that allows you to race a friend. </div>  <div> Key Features : Well developed physics engine that makes each car and truck feel how it is supposed to. Almost the whole Ford lineup is represented in the game, from the entry level Ka to the Mustang GT and GT90. SUV¬¥s and pickups, like the Explorer and F-150 are included as well. Race twelve other cars at the same time. Best-suited for a Ford enthusiast. Simple car-upgrade system based on acquiring parts rather than on performance tuning. Low price tag of $9.99.   </div>  <div> Critics : Game critics agreed that the game suffered from bad graphics, a very bad AI that is limited to following a preset racing line and pretty standard music. Some critics also stated that having only Ford vehicles didn't justify to make a full game. However, they praised its physics engine and the way each car was modeled after its real world counterpart. Its budget price tag was also noticed. </div> "

On board your (mecha) Wanzers, you and other characters engage in combat fighting and uncovering a political conspiracy between the super nations of the game. The majority of the story takes place in south-east asia between the fictional OCU nation and China. Early on in the game it is possible to take one of two very different routes for the games story. While the fundamental core of the narrative is similar, the progression, characters you encounter and enemies you fight changed drastically between both. The main story was believed to be the one with Kazuki's sister being a playable character while the alternate was one involving a blonde haired woman named Emma. Both these characters appear in both versions but play quite different roles. In order to chose which story you experience you must make a decision to your friends offer to go with him to a shopping mall early in the game. If you say yes you get Story A, no, Story B. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players of Front Mission 3 must progress through the games linear story by engaging in tactical turn based combat, selecting which areas to visit and characters to talk to and by checking emails and browsing information in the games fictional Internet known as Tenmou.  </div>  <div> Design : Character Progression and Mech CustomizationThe character progression aspect of Front Mission 3 allows different tactics to be played out on the battle screens as different Wanzers can be built to play different roles such as an up close attacker or a fast moving sniper.Pimp my mechLike general RPGs, characters are able to level up and increase their various stats which in turn boost their abilities in battle. Character skills can range to increasing the rate of fire when firing the Wanzer's machine gun to doing a full body charge when attacking with a melee weapon. Wanzers can be built from different parts which range in abilities such as accuracy, speed and defence taking into account weight and energy levels. Additionally Wanzers can be given weapons ranging from knuckledusters, flame-throwers to shoulder-mounted missile launchers. Wanzers can also be given back packs which can hold extra ammo or repair items, some backpacks have the ability to hold stored energy to expand the limits of customizing you or a team mates Wanzer. Additionally aesthetic details can be given to the mech such as paint jobs or giving it a different name than the stock parts.Combat and TacticsCombat in Front Mission 3 is usually Wanzer vs Wanzer but occasionally you will find yourself fighting against military hardware such as tanks, attack hellicopters or gun emplacements with you and your team either in Wanzer or on foot with a handgun.Combat Combat in the game is played on a square grid in which the usual win-condition is defeating all foes. Occasionally you may protect a certain character or vehicle whilst battling. On each turn you have the ability to move and attack with each of your characters on the field if your Ability Points permit it. When all your characters have ended their go then the turn order will switch to the enemy and they will proceed with moving and attacking. Wanzers can be customized in a variety of ways giving the player a different options to complete the battle objective. Wanzers with fast mobility legs can move more squares than a Wanzer which is fitted with a heavy grenade launcher for example.Not all combat is resolved by violence, occasionally if you cause enough havok on the battlefield AI NPCs will perform a surrender check. If the player shoots them lightly without destroying them they will fully surrender leaving them out of play for the entire match.Front Mission 3 also gives you the option to leave your Wanzer during battle expanding the overall strategy allowing for hijacking of enemy Wanzers which have had their pilots ejected by a forceful attack. Hijacking enemy Wanzers is beneficial as you obtain their Wanzer at the end of the battle and keep your own. Not only does hijacking benefit profit but can prove to be a greater combat tactic as it sometimes faster to hijack than to destroy on occasions. </div>  <div> Reception :  When you are not battling on the field, you will be talking to characters and visiting locations such as bars or market places to advance the story. Talking to certain NPC characters can grant you bonuses such as an extra weapon. The same can be said for extensive navigation of the fictional Internet Tenmou which has a variety of websites under password protection. This aspect of the game is not 3D like the combat and is displayed from a list of options such as TALK, VISIT, CHECK MAIL etc. over a 2d sprite backdrop. </div> "

While it is mainly a game about shooting big guns in the name of the law, Future Cop also plays host to several platform and puzzle sections which help to break up the action.Originally conceived as Future Strike, a new addition to the popular Strike franchise, the concept was later changed to that of futuristic cops and robbers, but with heavy artillery. A teaser trailer for Future Strike can be found in the game Nuclear Strike after the final cutscene. </div>  <div> Gameplay : X-1 AlphaIn the game, players take control of X-1 Alpha, a heavily armed vehicle capable of changing from a bi-pedal mech to a high-speed hovercraft at will. In Mech mode, players can move with ease over most terrain and jump over obstacles. This mode is also the easiest to control and is thus recommended for use in the platform sections. By contrast, in Hovercraft mode, X-1 Alpha is fast, nimble and can travel at speed over water. However all this speed comes at a price, with no traction it takes a second or two to come to a complete stop. Also steeply sloped terrain is almost completely impassable in hovercraft mode.To help with the fight against crime, the X-1 Alpha can be fitted with a selection of weapons divided into three groups: Guns, Heavy Weapons and Special Weapons. Spread throughout the levels are power-ups that repair you vehicle, replenish ammo for a weapon class or make a class of weapon more powerful. Weapon power-ups add an additional ammo supply of special ammo for a specific weapon, they are not time based. </div>  <div> Weapons : Guns are your basic weapons and therefore carry the most ammo. Compared to the other weapon classes, however, they are also far weaker per shot.Powered Mini-Gun: Twin mounted miniguns with a high rate of fire. Effective against Infantry and lightly armoured vehicles. Power-up increases damage and slightly increases rate of fire.Flame-thrower: Single, right mounted flame-thrower. Highly effective against grouped infantry. Power-up increases damage and range.Gatling Laser: Twin mounted Gatling laser similar to the miniguns. Effective against all enemies. Power-up increases damage and rate of fire.Electric Gun: Single right mounted electricity gun similar to a Tesla coil. Highly effective against infantry (capable of killing infantry with a single shot) Power-up adds chaining effect increasing effectiveness against grouped targets.(Secret weapon) Riot shield: Not really a gun. Generates a shield in front of the X-1 Alpha that adsorbs enemy fire and electrocutes anything foolish enough to wander too close. Power-up increases shield size to surround the X-1. </div>  <div> Gameplay modes : Heavy weapons are your go to weapons when the enemy start rolling out the armour.Hell-Fire Missiles: Basic homing missiles. Effective against lightly armoured targets. Power-up adds multiple warhead missiles that split and select their own targets making them effective when facing multiple enemies.Concussion Beam: Heavy laser cannon. Highly effective against fast moving and heavily armoured targets. While it is effective against masses infantry it is not recommended against single infantry targets as the guns can do the job just as easily, saving vital ammo. Power-up increases damage and fire rate.Hyper Velocity Rockets: Rapid multi fire rockets. A rather weak weapon it is however highly effective against fast moving targets and infantry. Power-up increases damage.Fusion Torpedo: Slow moving guided energy weapon. Effective against all targets. Power-up increases damage and range.(Secret weapon) K9 Robo Dog: Robot K9 unit fired similar to the hell-fire missile. Unlike the hellfire missiles, the Robo K9 will attack the selected target and will continue to damage the target until either it runs out of power and explodes or the target is destroyed. If the target is destroyed the robo K9 will seek out a fresh target nearby. Effective against massed infantry. Power-up increases the number of Robo-K9 that can be fired at once. </div> "

Magic can be used in one of three ways: an explosion of magic going outward from the character, a damaging shield that surrounds the character, or a thrown potion that explodes when it hits the ground. Power attacks can come in three different varieties. The kind of power attack is determined by a meter above the character's section at the bottom of the screen. The meter slowly fills up as the player causes more damage. The first (or green) level attack produces a more powerful version of the character's normal melee attack. The second (or yellow) level attack produces a 360-degree attack. The third and final (or red) level attack produces an indestructible projectile attack that annihilates any enemies in its path. </div> "

At one point a pack-in game for the ill-fated system, It was later ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC, and spawned two 3-D based sequels for the Playstation and Nintendo 64. </div>  <div> Story : Gex (voiced by comedian Dana Gould) is an anthropomorphic teenage gecko living in Hawaii with his mother and siblings. When his father, a NASA employee, is killed in a space shuttle accident, Gex becomes a shut-in, refusing to do nothing except watch television for hours on end in an attempt to refuse coping with his father's sudden and untimely death. After trying everything in her power to get her son out of the house and away from the television, Gex's mother decides to move the whole family to California.A change of scenery does nothing for Gex, however, and, after a few attempts by both his new neighbors and his family to get him away from the television, Gex's mom gets desperate and gives the TV away to gypsies. Gex soon runs away from home in outrage and befriends some local punk kids, one of which allows Gex to sleep in his garage.Months pass and Gex's mental state deteriorates to the point where he considers an imaginary figure called ""The Mayor"" as his best friend. While skateboarding with ""The Mayor"" one day, Gex encounters a black limo, which, come to find out, is now owned by his mother. Another death in the family (this time an uncle, who is noted as being the original model for the Izod clothing company logo) has caused Gex's family to obtain a huge inheritance. Gex uses his share of the funds to move back to Maui, where he buys a mansion, a big-screen TV, and an obscene amount of food so he will never have to leave his house.Of course, this being a 2-D platforming game, something bad is bound to happen that will cause the hero to go on some sort of ridiculous journey, and Gex winds up getting sucked into his new TV thanks to the villainous Rez, who plans on using our brave reptilian hero as the mascot for his hellish Media Dimension, an alternate universe where television fantasy becomes an antagonistic reality. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gex is your typical mid-90's mascot platforming title. Players must avoid obstacles, collect television remotes, and fight enemies in order to get to the end of the stage. Levels are connected by hub worlds, each with its own television-related theme, and occasional boss battles liven things up every now and then. Gex's main mode of attack was a tail whip, and he could obtain power-ups that let him, among other things, breathe fire and frost-based attacks. </div>  <div> Development : Gex was Crystal Dynamic's attempt to make a name for themselves by creating a Mascot for the 3DO. Development started with a small 5 person team in late 1992 when the newly recruited Lyle J. Hall was tasked with leading development of what would be the company's third major product. Told that the studio had Crash 'n Burn and Total Eclipse his set goal from the start was to create a mascot platformer for the 3DO which would involve the character's concept and creation, development of a platform, build a small team of developers and meet the tentative ship date of the end of 1994.The first few months of development (while the development team was being constructed) Lyle spent his time working with E. Daniel Arey on conceptual ideas for the game focusing on the gameplay attributes and concepts opposed to building the game around character. It wasn't until one of the concept artists returned from a Hawaii vacation with the conceptual idea of ""gecko shirts and lizards wearing sunglasses"" which he had seen frequently during his vacation. With the general idea set the team then spent several months determining what exactly a tongue-in-cheek gecko would look like. Although the team spent a lot of time experimenting with various different styles (going as far as hiring Lucasfilm to assist with some conceptual work) the final design for the character was came for a rough sketch from lead animator Steve Kongsle. Lyle then set about establishing his core development team as he set about bringing Gregg Tavares to lead programming, Mira F. Ross as lead artist and Justin Norr to assist leading the design of the game.From the offset the team knew that they wanted the ability for Gex to scale walls and crawl in practically any direction to help distinguish the game from its competition on the market. The team briefly considered to making the game one of the first 3D platformers but decided against it after seeing other developers struggling with development in three dimensions. However while the general mechanics were established the ""pop culture satire"" theme of the game had not.Instead development began (known internally as ""Gecko X"") with the concept of Gex being a stuntman on various different movie sets as a means of showcasing various different unique environments. This premise didn't last long, primarily due to the lack of framework the premise provided to support a decent story and setup a villain which the team wished to incorporate into the game.After a test level was completed using this early concept Lead Programmer ""G-Man"" expressed discontent with the game's direction and suggested a move to the game's final, more fantasy-themed direction. The character of ""Gecko X"" was redesigned into his current incarnation as ""Gex"" and a new villain, ""Rez"", was created as well. The stunt-gecko idea was also dropped.The team began working on art assets for the game but, due to the power of the 32-bit Panasonic 3DO when compared to the 16-bit consoles the devs had been working on up to that point, development moved slowly for the Gex team. Crystal Dynamics's initial reluctance to add more employees to the team did not help the slow dev process, and it looked unlikely that the game would be ready for its original release date of June 1994. The company eventually hired more artists, however, and even contracted out some of the graphical to work to Silicon Knights, who would later gain notoriety for developing Eternal Darkness for the Nintendo GameCube.June 1994 came and the game was only about halfway done. Levels were either completely redone with tile sets they weren't originally intended to use, or, in the case of a science-fiction themed world, scrapped entirely. Crystal Dynamics hired more employees to help finish the game, but Gex still needed a ton of work in order to stand out amongst the many other mascot platformers that had begun to flood the gaming market. Members of the development team worked 12-16 hour days, hoping to finish the game by Summer 1995. To kill off stress the tile set for the sci-fi levels was resurrected for hidden levels and two secret mini-games were added to the game's code. An 18 minute credit sequence was also created for the game, accessible by beating the hidden sci-fi levels.When the game was almost finished, play testers found a hidden level created by lead designer Justin Knorr that contained the message ""Didn't you think this level had some cool shit in it? This level was cut because the company didn't put you, the customer, first but just wanted to make money. Call Madeline Canepa at 415-555-1212 and give her a piece of your mind and my mind too"". The level was cut and Knorr was fired from the company.The game was originally slated to feature rail-shooter-esque levels in addition to the platforming segments, but these were later scrapped. </div>  <div> Ports : With the 3DO performing miserably in the gaming marketplace, Gex wound up being ported to the PlayStation and Sega Saturn shortly after its original release. The port was published by Crystal Dynamics and did not feature all of the secrets found in the 3DO version. In addition, the 3DO's save game feature was eliminated and passwords, considered a relic of the 16-bit era, were the only way players could continue the game at a later point without losing their progress.A PC port was later published by Microsoft Game Studios after the success of the game on consoles. </div>  <div> Legacy : Gex for the 3DO soon became the premier 2-D platformer for the system. Its success spawned two sequels, Enter the Gecko and Deep Cover Gecko, for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, both later remade for the Game Boy Color. Despite its two sequels and handheld ports, however, Gex's popularity never reached as high as the Crash Bandicoot's and Spyro the Dragon's of the world. The series did not make an appearance on the last generation of consoles, and, with Crystal Dynamics busy with the Tomb Raider series this generation, it is unlikely that we'll see a new title in the series any time soon. </div>  <div> System Requirements (PC) : OS : Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 92 MB available space </div>  <div> Links :  GMAN-GAMES: GEX - the game's lead programmer talks at length about the game's development </div> "

Palmer Productions (Game Boy Color port). The game was published by Midway Games (Nintendo 64 releases), Crystal Dynamics (US PlayStation release), BMG Interactive Entertainment (UK PlayStation release), Bandai (Japanese PlayStation release), Eidos (US PC release), Square Enix (PlayStation Vita PSone Classics release), and Ubisoft Entertainment (Outside of the US PC releases). </div>  <div> Story : No game is complete without zombiesGex: Enter the Gecko follows the adventures of the bipedal lizard Gex, an old (at this point retired) action game hero who has lost his passion for adventure and has slumped into a state of intense apathy, now spending every waking second watching TV, ordering Chinese food, eating Chinese food, or watching TV while eating Chinese food. After what could be years in this state, Gex's routine is interrupted by Rez, an old arch-nemesis who wants only to annoy Gex and destroy the world by combining the forces of various TV villains and running rampage on the real world. Gex, co-opted by the government and a crowbar is then tasked to go and save the world again.Gex's struggle takes him from old rerun series to old rerun series as he collects TV remotes to try and turn off the plans of Rez. To aid him in his quest Gex can wear special suits to feel more at home in the show he's in and break old TVs to gain powerup bugs that reside inside such as fire and ice breath, 1ups, health pickups, and others. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay revolved around collecting remotes by completing objectives or reaching the end of a level. These were red remotes that were collected as Gex completed either specific objectives that, when selected from the TV in the hub world Gex would receive a clue for, though any objective could be completed regardless of what hint was chosen. These remotes served a similar function to Mario 64's Power Stars or Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies.There are also white or silver remotes that are unlocked either by collecting 3 different tiers of items which varied from level to level, but always had some joke attached to them or amusing significance, or by finding the hidden white remote in a level. These remotes unlocked the special stage areas where the player can unlock yellow remotes that when every remote was collected, the ""true"" ending of the game was shown when the player defeats REX in the final boss.The game largely revolved around its 3D platforming. Gex has a variety of moves at his disposal to defeat enemies. Between the spin attack where he would spin his tail around in a sweeping motion, the coil jump which had the added bonus of launching Gex further up (though slowing his forward momentum) and the kung-fu kick which launched Gex forward straight into his enemy but inflicting slightly more damage than a spin kick, Gex was sorted.Camera control and player movement can be controlled with both left and right analog sticks as well as the D-pad and shoulder buttons. Entering a first person mode is done when both shoulders are held. The game also has a Metroid-style password system so that those who could not (or did not) use a memory card could carry over their remote completion over to their next play session. This, however, did not save the number of extra lives. </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Port : Gex features a large selection of levels that were all accessed via a large hub-world. The levels are inspired by different movie genres. Examples:Toon TV: A parody of Looney Toons. Gex, over the course of different levels will turn into an anthropomorphic rabbit character, a large duck, and fight giant cartoon styled enemies.Scream TV: A tongue-in-cheek homage to horror movies. Gex must contend with ghosts, Frankenstein's monster, zombies, mummies, bats, and giant bouncing skulls as he made his way through dressed like Dracula.Sea-Span: Centered around a Titanic-like ship. Exclusive to the N64 version.Circuit Central: A Tron-styled world that, like its inspiration, takes place inside a computer-styled world. There were really annoying floating electric things everywhere.Kung-Fu Theatre: A group of levels which featured a whole pile of ninjas, throwing stars, and giant death traps. Controlled by an evil pig named Mooshoo Pork, who is the boss of the second area.Rocket Channel: A Star Wars/Star Trek-themed level with no regard for subtlety in its references and had Gex dress up like Luke Skywalker.The Pre-History Channel: Tarzan-themed world too that took place in ancient times. Dinosaurs are everywhere, and there was far too much lava. Gex dressed as a caveman. </div>  <div> Reception : The Game Boy Color port of the game features the same stages as the console versions but are much smaller in size. The Game Boy Color port is also played in a 2D side-scrolling style rather than the polygonal 3D platforming of the console versions. </div> "

There are twelve missions available, a number of boss battles and a training mode that encompasses most of the gamplay elements you are likely to find in the story missions. The game also contains over thirty minutes of cutscenes produced by Production I.G, the studio responsible for the Ghost in the Shell films and television series, with the voice actors of the 90s anime movie reprising their roles. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Attacking a helicopter.The gameplay of Ghost in the Shell differs from most shooters in that the player controls a versatile walking tank, capable of scaling walls, clambering across ceilings and sliding around on retractable wheels. The extra mobility provided allows for a higher level of stage complexity than most ""run n' gun"" games, though apart from the training missions and some boss battles, it's rare that a player is required to exploit this. Some missions are ""on rails"" giving the player limited control over the Fuchikoma beyond slight movements, jumping and shooting. The players armament consists of machine guns and multiple-lock missles fired by tapping or holding down the ""shoot"" button respectively. In addition, the player has a limited number of screen-clearing grenades. There are no upgrades or new weapons to be found in the game.The training mode is worthy of special mention, providing the player with six Metal Gear-esque VR senarios and a number of unlockable videos dependent on completion ranks. All of the Fuchikoma's abilities need to be utilised if the player wishes to complete these missions with the highest score. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A soundtrack featuring renowned artists primarily known for techno, acid and tech-house was released in 1997 by Sony Music Entertainment Japan. The soundtrack was released in four versions: A single disc offering ""Ghost in the Shell:Megatech Body CD."" and a two disc variant ""Ghost in the Shell: Megatech Body CD. Ltd."". The two disc variant contains all tracks featured in the game and is thus considered the definitive version. Additionally, two vinyls were produced ""Megatech Body. Vinyl Ltd."" and ""Megatech Body.

Players progress through the game by competing in races against AI controlled opponents. Many of these races have specific requirements regarding which cars are allowed to participate. These limitations force players to purchase and tune specific cars that adhere to race guidelines. Cars are purchased and modified using an in-game currency of ""Credits"". Players earn credits for completing races or selling cars, and more credits are awarded for finishing a race in a high position.

The game is set in three different fictional cities:  Liberty City,  Vice City and  San Andreas. Each city is  loosely based on a real-life city. Liberty City is based on  New York, Vice City is similar to  Miami, and San Andreas is loosely adapted from  Los Angeles.The main character is dropped into the game world and does various odd jobs for the local  crime bosses. Progress through the different cities is done by earning money from completing missions assigned from various pay phones. </div>  <div> Evolutionary Differences : A number of major differences exist between Grand Theft Auto's design and that of the later games in the series:Mission failure is strict and inflexible. There is no option to return to a failed mission, it is simply gone forever.Money can be earned from  killing people and crashing cars.Three distinctly different cities are included. Subsequent games in the franchise would go on to focus on just a single city, with the  Grand Theft Auto III trilogy re-imaging the three cities contained in this game.The only modes of transportation are ground-based vehicles and walking/running. Boats, planes and other, more exotic forms of transportation were not included in the game.Support for internet and LAN multiplayer game modes. These would not officially return again until  Grand Theft Auto IV, though there would be unofficial patches to Vice City and San Andreas' PC versions to include similar functionality. </div>  <div> Characters : The PC version of the game lets players pick from eight characters while the playstation version only lets players choose the four male characters. There is no difference in the characters in the actual gameplay, the only real difference is when players change the characters name.TravisKatNikkiDivineTroyKivlovUlrike </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Genre: Funk*Ghetto Fingers - ""On The Move""*Ashtar - ""Aori""*Stylus Exodus - ""Pootang Shebang"" </div>  <div> Freeware Release : Genre: Trance*Retrograde - ""Benzoate""*Government Listening Post - ""E104""*Trancefer - ""Figiwhiz"" </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : Genre: Techno*Animal Testing Centre - ""DSP""*Rotorman - ""Ride""*Technophiliak - ""Lagerstar"" </div> "

Grand Theft Auto 2 would have a similar top down style to the original game, but with enhanced game mechanics and graphics. This was the last of the Grand Theft Auto games to use a strict top down camera. The game was first released on the original Playstation in October 22, 1999 and then two days later for PC. Grand Theft Auto 2 was also ported to both Game Boy Color and Dreamcast. There has been some criticisms of all versions that the storyline was lackluster and that the rewards for completing missions was disproportionate to the cost of items in-game. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The PC version of GTA2 included IP to IP multiplayer. This means that there were no server browsers and that most games were privately hosted in an era when broadband connections still had relatively low market penetration. The multiplayer had severe lag due to this networking model and was called ""unusable"" by most users. It should be noted that once someone is in Multiplayer, the map is drastically reduced, and most AI features are turned off. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Head RadioApostles of Funk - Yellow ButterPussywillows - Real LoveDavidson - All I Wanna DoThe One - SouthparkBula Matari - Taxi DriversFlytronix - PendulumAnna - Do It On Your OwnTesting - My Tiny WorldStikki Fingerz - Holdin' It Out For YouConor & Jay - Vegas RoadTrack 7 - I Wanna PhunkKREZNegro Vs.

The title was later ported to the PlayStation in 1999 where it was localized for North America by Sony Computer Entertainment America on October 26th. Grandia would be followed by a sequel called Grandia II in 2000 for the Sega Dreamcast along with many other sequels, spin-offs and ports for various platforms.On August 20, 2018, current IP holder GungHo Online Entertainment announced that an HD Remaster of Grandia would be headed to the Nintendo Switch as well as to the PC via Steam sometime in 2019. </div>  <div> Story : Grandia's story focuses on Justin, a teenage boy who aspires to become an adventurer like his father and grandfather before him. In the beginning the game focuses on Justin's father (who died years before the beginning of the story) Justin's father accomplished great things on his travels, he mostly discovered different speccies on the old continent . Hailing from a fairly small port town, known as ""Parm,"" Justin wants nothing more than to explore new places and become the greatest adventurer in the world. Even though Justin is well liked in his hometown, most people don't take him seriously and they don't believe that he will ever become a famous adventurer, Justin however is stubborn and eventually pursues his dreams. Justin's travels begins with a visit at the local museum, at the museum the curator tells Justin about an ancient civilization, and how Justin's ""spirit stone"" (a gift from Justin's father) is a link to that civilization . The curator tells Justin to go to the Sult Ruins, which will give him some answers and he hand over a letter that will allow Justin to enter the ruins to learn about the ""Angelo"" civilization and their history. However Justin encounters the military who has made the ruins into an excavation site. Justin sneaks into the center of the ruins, where he learns something that encourages him to leave Parm and search for more information.That something is told to young Justin by Liete, a young woman who he finds in the Sult ruins. She tells Justin to start his new adventure by traveling to the New World. Justin, decides to take the boat to the New World and begin his adventure alone, afraid to tell his Mother so she won't stop him and not to have the burden to protect his young friend Sue. During his travels to the New World, Justin discovers a few things, Sue can not be stopped by being left behind. Sue is caught by the ships crew as a stowaway. After working as part of the crew so Sue would not be fed to the fishes of the ocean, the adventures meet Feena, a true adventurer. A woman with beautiful green hair and many adventurer stories. Shortly after meeting Feena, they are attacked by a Ghost ship and have to join forces with the fierce warrior in order to save their lives and the lives of the people on their ship.Once the trio arrive in New Parm, Feena offers for them to visit her at her home north of town after they have finished their business in town but she will not be able to join them, though Feena has fought ghosts and other horrible monsters, there is something more sinister and foul in the town that she doesn't dare step foot in. Justin and Sue discover why Feena avoids the town when Justin tries to apply to be an adventurer. The Adventurers society new president Pakon, is an arrogant, selfish brat who is very selective in who he lets into the society. Pakon has delusions that his love for Feena is shared by her as well and goes over the line by kidnapping her in an attempt to marry him. Justin and Sue come to Feenas rescue and stop the wedding which results in Feena losing her Adventure license and banning Justin for life. With his head held high, Justin explains to Feena that nobody tells the wind where it can go and that is what a true adventurer is. Feena, Sue and Justin leave New Parn in search of treasure, glory and adventure.The group travel North to Misty forest where they discover the Dom ruins, after avoiding death traps and monsters they reach their destination where Liete returns and explains to the party that they need to continue to travel to the end of the world for they will see that there is no such thing as the end of the world. After leaving the ruins they discover a young humanoid creature with a horn on its head and tail injured. They take the creature back to Feena's hut. Feena tells Justin that there is an herb that will help save the creatures life in the mountains. After finding the herb they create the medicine and apply it to the wounds. Knowing that they have done all that they can they go to sleep only to wake in the morning with the creature gone. They hear strange music coming from outside and find the creature playing an instrument. The creature hands them a nut to eat but before they can eat the food they are surrounded by the Garlyle Forces, the creature and the party are taken away as prisoners.At the Garlyle base after a failed escape attempt, Justin is talked to by Leen who hints that if he could escape again his best course of action would be to steal the military train. Leen walks away and drops the key inside the prison cell allowing Justin to escape once again and free his friends. Justin explains how dumb Leen was for dropping the Key and explaining how to escape. Before leaving they locate the creature and free him as well. After freeing him, he gives the nuts to the party once again. After eating the nuts they find that it allows them to communicate with ""Rem"" and he explains to them that he is from the village of Luc that is hidden away by Mist so that no one from the outside can find it. He left the village to see the outside world when he was attacked by the Garlyle Forces. The group escapes the facility by hijacking the military train and head for Rems Village. </div>  <div> Gameplay : 2d sprites on a 3d polygonal worldGrandia's game world is displayed in 3D with a rotatable camera, although all characters show up as 2D sprites on the world. In this way, the game resembles some other games of its era, such as Xenogears. Although the camera did not cause very many issues generally, it occasionally would cause the player's view to be obstructed.Enemies in the game always appeared in the field. Like in most traditional RPGs of its type, touching an enemy would take the player away from the field and the characters would enter a battle screen.There is a world map in Grandia, but the player does not travel across it in the normal vein of traditional RPGs. Instead, the areas on the map are merely shown as different points which can be selected to travel to. Usually, one of the points between major towns will be a wilderness area which must be traversed by the player. </div>  <div> Characters : Although Grandia's characters and story are generally well-liked by the series' fans, the game is most widely recognized for its battle system. Unlike the most popular timing-based RPG battle system used in the Final Fantasy games, Grandia's system placed all the characters and enemies on one bar. All characters' icons moved toward the right side of the bar. When halfway down the bar, the player would then be able to choose a command for the character. After this, there would be a short ""Wait"" time in which the character would prepare to attack. Upon reaching the end of the bar, the character would perform the action given to them.Aside from normal attacks (in which the character would strike twice), the player could also choose to use a Critical Attack. This would allow the player to use one attack with a chance of stunning an enemy if they were in the ""Wait"" position on the timing bar. The use of the timing in the battle system was what set Grandia's battle system apart. Players also have the options of Defending and using Skills or Magic. While different Skills are given to individual characters based on their weapon and Magic statistics, most Magic skills could be taught to nearly any character (although some of the strongest spells could only be acquired by certain team members).In most RPG's you level you characters up but in the Grandia universe you not only level up your character but each time you use your magic or weapons as well they will gain levels. By leveling up certain weapons and magic you can combine them to create even greater damaging abilities. An example of this would be to level up your whip with Feena once it reaches a certain level along with leveling fire, you will be able to do an attack that uses both to damage your foes. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Justin - Justin, age 14, lives with his mother Lilly in the town of Parm in the Old World.

Unlike other games in the genre, killing enemies does not grant the player XP points, due to the main character leveling up only in predetermined plot points in the campaign.  </div> "

It was later released in North America (by Atlus on October 31, 1998) and Europe (by Studio 3 in May 2000).The first original fighting game developed by Arc System Works (from the production group known as ""Team Neo Blood"", led by Daisuke Ishiwatari), Guilty Gear features themes inspired by seinen manga, anime-style character sprites, a heavy metal soundtrack, and a distinct fast-paced gameplay system. It later received numerous sequels, starting with Guilty Gear X.The story is set in futuristic 2180, five years after the end of the ""Crusades"" (a century-old conflict between mankind and bio-mechanical living weapons known as ""Gears"", created using an unlimited energy source known as ""magic""). Although the Gear leader Justice was imprisoned (in a seemingly-impenetrable dimensional prison) by the military group ""Sacred Order of Holy Knights"", the Union of Nations noticed the walls of the prison eroding and organized a no-holds-barred fighting tournament to form a new Sacred Order and prepare for Justice's return.It was digitally re-released via PlayStation Network (as a PSOne Classics title) for supporting consoles in Japan (on May 31, 2007) and Europe (on August 6, 2009). It was also ported to the PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC as a digital release on May 16, 2019, with the Switch version included in the 2019 Guilty Gear 20th Anniversary Edition compilation. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays similar to most other 2D fighting games, such as the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. It uses four attack buttons of ascending strength (Punch, Kick, Slash, and Heavy Slash), as well as two special buttons (Taunt and Respect).Techniques in this game include:The game includes a universal chain combo system, known as the Gatling Combination, that allows players to link normal attacks of a similar or higher attack into combos. The order is P -> K -> S -> HS -> S + HS.Like most fighting games, the game includes special moves that are performed with a specific joystick and button combination. Unlike most games, most special moves only use one button, rather than multiple strength buttons (such as LP and LK). Special moves can be performed while blocking.Dashing across the screen by double-tapping Forwards or Backwards on the joystick. Dashes can be performed in mid-air. The front-facing ground dash can be held into a continuous running motion. Special move combinations that end with Forward on the joystick can be ""dash-modified"" to launch the character forward while performing it.Charge a specific special move (one per character) to increase the effectiveness of the next attempt of that special move (up to three levels). Charging is done by inputting a variation of that special move (using the Respect button) and leaves the character vulnerable (although they can cancel out of it).A special launcher attack (S + HS) that launches opponents into the air when hit. This can be followed-up (by pressing Upwards on the joystick) to begin a new air combo.Throwing an opponent (F/B + Heavy Slash).Perform a higher Super Jump by tapping Downwards on the joystick before jumping.Perform a Down Avoidance technique (Up + any button) as the character is being knocked down to quickly recover.Initiating one of two taunts, one by pressing the Taunt button and one by pressing the Respect button. The Taunt version is cancelable.Turning in mid-air by pressing the Taunt button for advanced cross-ups.One unique aspect of attacking is Clashing (or ""Sousai""), in which a situation where both players hit each-other with close-ranged attacks at the same time causes neither character to get hit. While clashed, characters can cancel it into other attacks. </div>  <div> Characters : The game utilizes a super meter system known as the Chaos Gauge, which accumulates every time the player lands or guards a hit. When it is full, players can expend it to perform a character-specific super special move, known as the Chaos Move (or ""Kakusei Hissatsu-waza"", lit. ""Awakening Deadly Technique""). Players can also perform two additional techniques when the Chaos Gauge is full:A guard-cancelling counterattack (known as Gamble), by tapping forward and Kick while blocking. This expends the gauge.A dash tackle attack (known as Crash) by colliding with an enemy at a certain point during a long dash.Similar to the Real Bout Fatal Fury games, the game utilizes a dual-layer lifebar (green and yellow), and when the first (green) layer is depleted, the character enters Chaos Mode and can perform an unlimited amount of Chaos Moves without depleting the Chaos Gauge.In addition, the Chaos Gauge can be used during a Perfect Guard to negate chip damage from special moves. This technique is performed by holding the Respect button while blocking, and expends part of the gauge for each attack blocked. </div> "

K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. Specifically, the game is based on the second book and film in the series of the same name. The game follows the plot of the book for the most part, although random missions were thought up to add length to the game, like multiple missions where Harry havs to save or help other pupils. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Inside Hogwarts.The game starts out at Ron Weasley's house, where some chores must be taken care of in which the player will play some mini-games.After that, the player gets sent to Diagon Alley. Here, the game actually adds the first additional gameplay sequence by expanding on the little side trip Harry makes.After this sequence, the player gets taken to Hogwarts, where the game begins in earnest.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Bully (Canis Canem Edit or Bully: Scholarship Edition), Rockstar's over-the-top highschool simulator.The player will need to take classes to advance the story. Upon taking one of the classes, the player will be sent into a backroom of the classroom in order to retrieve a spellbook associated with that class. The player will come across a spell that turns giant blue eggs into birds if the ""Transfiguration"" class is taken, while the ""Incendio"" spell that sets object aflame will be learned in the ""Defense against the Dark Arts"" class.In between classes, players can also take missions from pupils. The game has a day/night cycle, and some missions must be done during nighttime. When it's dark, prefects will roam the halls of Hogwarts, as well as the grounds outside. Like in the books, there is always a contest going on between the houses in points, which are gained by doing things well in the classes. If the player is caught by a prefect or Filch however, some points will be lost. Magical trick items like dungbombs and certain spells to distract these watchmen can be purchased.While missions are not being done, Hogwarts castle and the grounds surrounding it can be freely explored.There are some odd jobs that can be done as well. the player can become champion of the dueling club, trade stuff with fellow pupils, attempt to make other houses lose points and run people over with a broom. </div>  <div> Additional Information : The Lumos spell reveals more than might be imaginedThe player will eventually receive a broomstick, the Nimbus 2000. This broom can be obtained at any time while outside, though not in missions where the player has to go to the Forbidden Forest. This can actually be used to make certain missions easier, for instance; in one mission, school prefects must be avoided while trying to get across the school grounds in order to get to Hagrid's house. The broom can be used to fly across the school grounds, avoiding that part of the mission entirely. The broomstick can also be used to reach otherwise inaccessible part of the castle, like certain rooftops.There are huge differences between the PlayStation and PlayStation 2/Xbox versions of the game. For instance, while Harry travels to Diagon Alley with flu powder, things go wrong. On PlayStation, the player must attempt to keep Harry on the middle of the slide with the analog stick. On PlayStation 2 however, this sequence is not present at all, and the player simply gets dropped off in a cutscene. This is one of the few examples of the PlayStation game having more content in a gameplay sequence. For the rest of the game, this tends to be the other way around. </div> "

What started as a novel craze and moved into every other medium, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first entry into the seven part Potter series. </div>  <div> Story : The Philosopher's Stone maintains the passive narrative of the novel. Harry attends classes, and earns points for Gryffindor house based on the quality of his work, while the story waits for something to happen.While the stories of video game and novel Harry Potter hit the same main points, the actual worlds differ greatly. For example, video game Gringotts seems to provide money based on the amount a person can gather from the scattered vaults while being hurdled past them at breakneck speeds and dodging intentionally placed beams of wood. Even before that, the goblins force their patrons to collect documents scattered on their waxed, slippery floor. All just to strap into the mine cart in the first place.While the game is not technically proficient, or for the most part fun, it still appeals to the younger Potter audience eager to try their hand in the Wizarding world. </div>  <div> Collectibles : Harry Potter may choose to collect four types of Bertie Bott's All Flavor Beans. The video game Weasley twins trade them for secret phrases Harry needs to get past four portraits. Harry steals an unknown someone's hidden property, such as the Nimbus 2000, from behind these portraits.There are also 24 Famous Witches and Wizards cards to collect.

It is the only game in the Harvest Moon series that was developed for the original PlayStation, and was also the first Harvest Moon game to appear on a non-Nintendo console. The game received largely positive reviews upon release, with its colorful graphics and addictive gameplay staying true to the much-loved conventions of the series. </div>  <div> Setting : The game is set in the idyllic location of Mineral Town. The town, while being relatively small, has everything that an aspiring farmer could need. There is a blacksmith which you can use to upgrade your tools, a store to buy seeds and other items, as well as neighboring farms where you can buy livestock. The countryside surrounding the farm offers an abundance of natural resources; from collecting wild berries to chopping wood for timber. You can fish in the lakes and rivers close to your farm, or in the ocean. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay in Harvest Moon: Back to Nature is similar to other games in the series. You are tasked with returning your Grandfather's farm back to its former glory; through keeping the fields clear of weeds and debris, growing and harvesting crops, and rearing livestock. The farm buildings themselves can also be improved and upgraded, in order to accommodate more livestock and to give you enough room to start a family. Perhaps one of the most important improvements that can be made is the building of a hothouse, which enables you to plant any crops throughout the year (regardless of what particular season you are in).There is also a social aspect to the game, in that you are required to befriend your fellow villagers (perhaps through helping out and taking part in annual events), and also search for a potential love interest, to ensure that the village accepts you as the rightful owner of the farm and allows you to stay. </div>  <div> Animals : Received on the first day you arrive at your new farm. You should hug your dog every day in order to develop a strong bond between you. You can purchase a rubber ball from the character Won, and with this you can play fetch with your dog. This will enable your dog to perform better at the Dog Race held each year. </div>  <div> Crops : Can be obtained from the Yodel ranch in the Spring of your first year in the game. You are not required to provide food for your horse (as it receives all its nourishment from grazing on the fields), but you should talk to it everyday. You can also purchase a brush from the character Saibara (the blacksmith) which will further help to increase your horse's affection towards you. </div>  <div> Game Breaking Bug : Chickens make a perfect starter animal, as they are relatively cheap and easy to look after. Chickens, chicken feed, and medicine can all be purchased from the Poultry Farm next door. You should use one unit of chicken feed per chicken every day. If you look after your chickens they will produce one egg each every day. As your chicken's affection towards you grows, it will produce larger eggs. If your chicken wins the annual Chicken Festival, it will start to lay golden eggs.You can increase the capacity of your chicken coop from five animals to ten through enlisting the services of the character Gotz. </div> "

The game depicts a precocious young boy named Andy who sets off on a fantastic quest to rescue his kidnapped dog Whisky from the shadowy forces of evil.Heart of Darkness was designed by noted French developer Eric Chahi. Similar to Chahi's previous title Out of This World, the gameplay consists exclusively of 2D flip screen platforming with puzzle-solving elements. Heart of Darkness was also one of the first games to feature a fully orchestrated musical score.The game is completely unrelated to the Joseph Conrad novel of the same name. </div>  <div> Story : Andy is a young boy with a knack for inventing gadgets and a wild imagination. He is often at odds with his schoolteacher, a domineering old man who punishes Andy for sleeping in class by attempting to lock him inside a cupboard while also teasing Andy about his fear of the dark. Fortunately Andy is saved by the ringing school bell and makes a hasty escape from the classroom, with his teacher furiously shouting that tomorrow's test will cover the solar eclipse scheduled to occur that same afternoon.Andy's faithful dog Whisky meets him at the school's entrance, and the pair hitch a ride on a streetcar to watch the eclipse in a nearby park. As the moment of totality approaches, living shadows materialize and reach out towards the whimpering Whisky before snatching the dog away, leaving Andy and his favorite baseball cap behind.Determined to rescue his canine companion, Andy runs home and clambers up to the treehouse in his backyard where he stores his inventions. He activates his custom-built computer and initiates the startup sequence for a single-seat spacecraft built from scrap parts. Andy also retrieves his homemade plasma cannon just before blasting off for parts unknown. </div>  <div> Gameplay : This is a 2D side scrolling platform game similar to the original  Prince of Persia, Out of This World, and  Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey. Andy can walk, jump, crawl, climb and swim. He can also use magic to grow trees and attack enemies. Later in the game he can use his plasma gun against shadow creatures. The player must solve puzzles which involve timing the character's movement and using his various abilities to progress through the game. If Andy falls into a pit or is killed by the shadow creatures, the game is over. </div>  <div> Development : Eric Chahi, the creator of the classic adventure game Out of This World was the creative force behind Heart of Darkness. The game had been in development at Amazing Studio for more than five years and suffered numerous delays before it was finally released in 1998. The development time was mostly spent in creating the game's music and FMVs. Chahi himself would not return to active game development for nearly a decade following Heart of Darkness' release. </div> "

It is the second game in the Serpent Riders trilogy (between Heretic and Hexen II). The story takes place in the realm of Cronos, which was overtaken by the Serpent Rider Korax. The player controls one of three heroes ( Baratus the Fighter, Parias the Cleric, or Daedolon the Mage) as they set out to destroy Korax.The game builds upon the same engine used in Heretic (which uses a heavily-modified id Tech 1, the same engine used in Doom). In addition to the modifications found in Heretic, Hexen also includes jumping, multiple classes, rotating/moveable walls, weather effects, a level scripting system, CD audio, FMV cutscenes (for the CD version only), eight player multiplayer, and a system of interconnected levels (called ""hubs""). The source code for this engine was released twice: one in 1999 under a restrictive license and one in 2008 under the GNU General Public License.The game was published for the Mac in 1996 by GT Interactive (who also oversaw distribution of the PC version). In early 1997, the game was ported to the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn (all which were published by GT Interactive). The Nintendo 64 version, ported by Software Creations, includes split-screen multi-player ( for up to four players) and text narratives in the loading screens of each level (describing each level). The PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions were ported by Probe, and includes graphical restrictions (less detailed architecture, less monster sprites, etc.) and lower frame rate. The PlayStation version does not support multi-player, while the Sega Saturn version includes two-player link-up multiplayer only accessible via a hidden cheat code. </div>  <div> Characters : Hexen was one of the first first-person shooters to let the player choose between one of three unique classes, each with their own unique attributes, weapons, and item effects. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Tougher and more agile than the other classes, the fighter specializes in melee combat. His only weakness is his lack of ranged attacks.Spiked Gauntlets - The fighter's starting weapon. Deals three powerful punches in quick succession at very close range.Timon's Axe - Its power and effectiveness is determined by how much blue mana the hero has. Although blue mana is not needed to swing the weapon, blue mana is required for a powerful electric swing.Hammer of Retribution - On close range, it's slow and does great damage. But if the hero has green mana, the hammer can fire an exploding projectile, making it an ideal long-range weapon for the class.Quietus - A big sword surrounded by green flames. Throws five green fireballs across the screen in a single swing. Uses up both green and blue mana and cannot be used like a melee weapon. </div>  <div> Deathkings of the Dark Citadel : Despite the class name, the cleric does not heal others. A balanced character with a lot of specialized weapons.Mace of Contrition - Although it is less powerful than the fighter's spiked gauntlets, this mace has a longer range.Serpent Staff - Uses blue mana for two purposes. At long range, it fires two green fireballs in a wave that, while weak, deals poisonous damage. At short range, it drains the health of the opponent, healing the hero in the process.Firestorm - Uses green mana to shoot a streak of fire from the hero's hands across a set distance, causing explosion damage in the process.Wraithverge - Uses both blue and green mana to fire a gray cloud that immediately splits into four powerful ghosts. Shrieking, these fast ghosts lock in to enemies and drain a lot of damage before moving on to the next enemy. (Or disappearing once the attack is over) </div> "

You have a spin attack and a punch, making the combat feel sort of like Crash Bandicoot, although you can only perform the spin attack while jumping. You also have a bat-like ability to glide your way to certain platforms. There are also nitro boxes you'll be smashing to increase your nitro power, which can unlock bonus levels. The game was known for its relentless difficulty and overpowered enemies. Not to mention the loss of a life whenever falling off of a platform; which was very frequent, while finding or gaining new lives was not. Jersey Devil had many things to collect throughout the game as well. Along with the letters for K-N-A-R-F, there were pumpkins and hostages. Hostages would be found in cages throughout many of the stages and would be have to be released to ""collect"" them. Pumpkins were plentiful and every hundred would grant an extra life to the character.Jersey Devil did feature different environments spanning museums, graveyards, forests, sewers, and even chemical plants. Each environment hosted different enemies and usually a different play style to combat them effectively. </div>  <div> Reception : The gameplay was heavily inspired by other 3D platformers of the time however Jersey Devil did not perform as well commercially as similar games like Crash Bandicoot and Croc: Legend of the Gobbos, and there is now considered something of a rare game to find. It can be found for prices reaching up to its original release price of fifty dollars currently.Upon release it received average reviews, with critics citing the steep difficulty curve and poor story as the games major drawbacks, however the orchestral score written by Gilles Leveille was heavily praised as one of the games strongest points. </div> "

The game contains 10 tracks in locations varying from beaches to swamps to glaciers to stratospheric freeways, as well as racing teams sporting corporate logos from youth-targeted brands such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger. The game is noteworthy for its introduction of so-called Suicide Tracks where the players race head-on against each other, crashing frequently. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game features several terrains and the Motos handle appropriately on each of them. Riding over water causes the player to slow down, riding on dirt or asphalt provides a fast and stable ride, and riding on glaciers is as slippery as would be expected. The game features a largely unwieldy Magnetic Grappling mechanic which is intended to help players traverse switchbacks and sharp corners but often ends up leaving players pointing in the wrong direction or slamming them into a wall.The tracks were designed to frequently get players airborne, whether in short hops or large jumps, which encourages players to compensate for the frequent air time by learning the courses and planning a fast and reliable strategy. Most of the tracks also contain several routes -- usually of varying difficulty and altitude -- which is a trend not commonly found in racing games at the time.Suicide Tracks were an innovation brought to the genre by Jet Moto in which players raced on a linear course as opposed to a circular one. Once players reached either end of a Suicide Track, they would turn around and head in the opposite direction, often directly into the face of oncoming traffic. This was a particularly fun race mechanic to enjoy while playing in split-screen mode with a friend as you attempt to target each other. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Jet Moto contains four different modes:Single Race - A simple way to jump into a race on any track against AI-Controlled opponents.Custom Circuit - Allows for customization of scoring type and the ability to choose the trackset. Championship scoring assigns scores based on placement. Rally scoring combines track times and the player with the lowest time wins. Elimination scoring removes the losing racers after each race.Full Season - The game's 'campaign'/season/championship mode that cycles through all of the tracks.Practice - No A.I. racers are added and there is no way to lose. </div>  <div> Teams and Riders : In alphabetical order: </div>  <div> Courses : Team AxiomBlackjackShirowStoneTechnicianTetsujin </div>  <div> PlayStation Network : Team ButterfingerArroyoBomberMaceMasalaRhino </div> "

However, they get delayed constantly by Dio's assassin's, as his ties to the Joestar bloodline enable him to sense them coming. When they eventually make it to Egypt, they face many problems, including Kakyoin's injury. When the group confronts Dio's, they are shocked by his unique, and immense powers. Dio assaults Avdol along with his 2nd in command, Vanilla Ice, who murders him using his stand. Finally, Dio faces Jotaro in a final battle, but not before killing Kakyoin, who returned to help them defeat Dio. Dio also sucked the blood out of Joseph, becoming incredibly strong in the process.

Special attacks are enhanced but the Stand cannot act independent of the character.

The character will have a larger hit box during Stand mode and can be hit by high attacks even while crouching.The Stand will receive durability damage if directly attacked or when absorbing chip damage. When the Stand is attacked directly, the character will also suffer that amount in damage. Once durability is depleted, the Stand will disappear and the character will suffer Guard Break and an extended hitstun. Certain attacks can also deplete the entire durability gauge in one hit.There is also an ability dubbed ""Tandem"" attack. Using 1 power bar, the Stand can be commanded to execute a series of attacks while the player is free to act. Also, certain characters allow the player to take direct control of the Stand and it can move way from the character. On the downside, the character will be left completely vulnerable to attacks. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes 16 playable characters, 6 hidden characters and variations (all of which are unlockable through either a cheat code or a time-release system), and two unplayable sub-bosses (3 in the PS1 version). </div> "

In that view the player will notice that the game is on a timer if they don't beat the stage fast enough Robbit will lose one of his lives.

During the game his main mission is to collect 4 jet pods to make it to the next area and after the first two he will fight a boss.

Kensei: Sacred Fist is very similar in gameplay to the Tekken franchise, but with slight differences. The biggest one is it's emphasis on strategy, and planning out your combo's and juggles based on your distance. It was made with an ideal to avoid button-mashing, as missing the first hit in a combo string will leave the player open for a long time. Another difference is in it's blocking system, based on dodging. When pressing the block button, the player will actually move away from the attack. Some characters can incorporate a sidestep into their dodge by holding up. Sidestepping itself is not very useful, as it is very slow, much like the gameplay in general, something that made the game suitable only for the home console experience, as the arcade scene was very much focused on high speed reaction time. </div>  <div> Characters : Character Select screen with all characters unlocked.Kensei: Sacred Fist features 9 fighters in its starting roster, each with their own unique fighting style, their 9 mid-boss counterparts (each with a slightly altered moveset), 2 boss characters, and 3 hidden characters, all of which are unlockable (for a grand total of 23 playable characters).Yugo Sangunji - KarateSaya Tsubaki - KenpoHong Yuli - Drunken FistDavid Human - Professional WrestlingDouglas Anderson - Jeet Kune DoHyoma Tsukikage - NinjutsuAllen - Muay ThaiHeinz Streit - Pit FightingAnn Griffith - Amateur Wrestling </div>  <div> Racing Minigame : Akira Sangunji (mid-boss for Yugo) - KarateGenya Tsubaki (mid-boss for Saya) - KenpoSu Qingtao (mid-boss for Yuli) - Drunken FistMark Galeon (mid-boss for David) - Professional WrestlingYoko Cindy Matsudaira (mid-boss for Douglas) - Jeet Kune DoSessue Kanoh (mid-boss for Hyoma) - NinjitsuSteve Laettner (mid-boss for Allen) - KickboxingNatsuki Kornelia (mid-boss for Heinz) - Pit FightingArthur Stewart (mid-boss for Ann) - Amateur WrestlingZhou Leimeng (sub-boss) - ""Original Style""Kaiya Tsubaki (final boss) - KenpoKazane Tsukikage (hidden character) - NinjutsuJelly Thomas (hidden character) - ""Original Style""Billy Thomas (hidden character) - ""Original Style"" </div> "

The game revolves around the protagonist Klonoa and his sidekick Huepow. The game also spawned a sequel Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil. It was subsequently re-released via PlayStation Network in Japan and North America in 2011 and Europe in 2012, as a part of the ‚ÄúPS One Classics‚Äù line ‚Äì a version which was ultimately compatible with PS3, PSP, and PS Vita.A remake of the game (simply titled Klonoa for the West) developed for the Wii platform was released in Japan on December 4th 2008 and in North America on May 5th 2009 and in Europe on May 22nd of the same year. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Throughout the game the player controls Klonoa, a cat-like creature with wings as ears, and his trusty sidekick Huepow, a spirit enchanted inside of a ring. The gameplay in Klonoa is rather unique as the game is played in 2.5D, this means the majority of the game is a 2D sidescrolling platformer but at certain points the player will need to interact with objects outside of the 2D dimensions. Klonoa can fire Huepow from his ring to interact with objects and enemies. Once Klonoa has hit an enemy he can use it to double jump or fire it at another enemy causing them to collide and explode. Other core elements of the gameplay include running, jumping and solving puzzles to progress through the games next set of levels which are called Visions. The game consists of 6 Visions each with two sections in which the second section contains a Boss fight at the end. Bosses are an integral part of the gameplay in Klonoa, however they have been criticized for their difficulty. </div>  <div> Plot : Klonoa's nightmareThe games plot starts in the Town of Breezegale which is fueled by its inhabitants dreams, though no one can clearly remember them. However, Klonoa is able to remember one dream, specifically vivid of an object falling from the sky and crashing into the nearby mountain. One day Klonoa awakes to a find that an object has infact crashed into the mountain and he sets off with his best friend Huepow to find out what happened. When they reach the top of the mountain they find two strange men, Ghadius and Joka who are searching for a pendant with magical properties. They then kidnap the Legendary Diva Lephise which spurs Klonoa and Huepow to chase after them. </div>  <div> Locations and Bosses : BaladiumBreezegale is the wind village of Phantomile. The villagers of Breezegale all resemble anthropomorphic rabbits, with long furry ears and catlike faces. As can be expected, it is the village that our hero Klonoa calls home. Among the many outstanding features of this town is the Bell of Wind, a giant golden bell placed at the top of the aptly named Bell Hill with the Moon Pendant of Lephise is hidden inside. Besides the Bell, another landmark of Breezegale is the gigantic Windmill near the town's center. This windmill is shown as being the source of the Wind Spirit's power during the second game cinematic. Last but not least, Balue's Tower is also located in Breezegale. Although construction on this tower was only beginning as the game started, by the end of the story it has been completed. Upon unlocking the Tower as a bonus level, it is revealed to be several stories high... one of the largest structures in all of Phantomile. The boss of this stage is the Rongo Lango, one of Joka's pets. When returning to a corrupted Breezgale later in the game, the boss will be Baladium, a winged cobra with various unusual abilities. </div>  <div> Wii Release : The CogForlock is the ancient wood village of Phantomile. The entire village consists solely of a colossal tree-house, the home of many jungle citizens. The most ancient and well-known citizen in all of Forlock is Granny, who knows large amounts of old legends, myths, and other forgotten stories. She lives at the very top of Forlock in a gigantic mansion of wooden machinery. Located on the very side of Granny's house is a huge cog, which if stops turning stops the flow of water to Jugpot. It is also interesting to note that the Wood Spirit of Phantomile gives its energy from this very contraption during the second game cinematic. The boss of this stage is Gelg Bolm, a bizarre bomb-like creature that is only defenseless to attacks from above. </div>  <div> Soundtrack Release : Boss fight against PamelaJugpot is the large Phantomilian kingdom of Water that connects directly to Forlock. In the very center of Jugpot is a giant seashell with a cog in the center. Besides holding the power of Phantomile's Water Spirit, this structure is also the source of all water for the three Kingdoms and the Castle of King Seadoph himself. He rules alongside his ""servant"" Pamela: a fishlike creature with the ability to fly. Pamela has a son named Karal who befriends Klonoa during the game's story. During the story Ghadius possesses both Seadoph and Pamela in an attempt to destroy Jugpot. It is only due to Karal's help that Klonoa meets and confronts the distressed King, ultimately freeing him from the Ghadius' powers. Once freed, Seadoph directs our two heroes to Forlock, the Tree Village in order to stop Ghadius. The boss of this stage is Pamela. She can only be defeated by throwing Seadoph at her. </div> "

Koudelka,Sacnoth,"JPNA SNK, Infogrames","June 29, 2000",ps,Crawl through the corridors of a building being torn apart at the seams by demonic forces.,3030-5223,5223,0,1999-12-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/koudelka/3030-5223/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview :  The heroine KoudelkaOn a dark and dreary night outside of a foggy little abbey, a hooded figure rides up to the doors on a horse. Nothing but silence settles on the surroundings as the character dismounts and attempts to knock. Upon discovering that the door is completely sealed, the hooded character goes around the back of the building. Slowly, the figure climbs up and eventually makes her way into the building. Then suddenly darkness, screams, blood, and monsters. The intro of Koudelka is one that leaves the player with a good idea of what is to come. This game is the first entry in what became known as the Shadow Hearts series. The game follows a heroine by the name of Koudelka and a band of would be dead men if it weren't for her intervening. Spectacular cinematics, grid based gameplay, and a peculiar setting constitute this horror JRPG from many years past. </div>  <div> Story : The Shadow Hearts franchise is known for its cult based story-telling, with many figures from reality being skewed by the writer. Koudelka was the game that started this trend of dark storytelling. As previously mentioned, the game follows a heroine by the name of Koudelka. However, not everything is at it appears. Koudelka has the mysterious ability to heal people, and seems to be drawn in by some kind of demonic forces that pervade the building. Over the course of the game, the player takes control of Koudelka and the people she meets along the way in order to solve the mystery of this dark setting. The characters in Koudelka are all fairly normal people placed into an abnormal situation. The first character you meet in the game is dying when he meets Koudelka. After being rescued by her healing spells, he follows Koudelka for a good portion of the game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Koudelka is a mix between turn-based roleplaying that you find in other JRPGs such as Final Fantasy, and a grid based movement system found in games like Disgaea. This combination of two types of combat systems created a fairly unique JRPG for its time. There is a lot of strategy elements in the game that are a direct result of this marriage between two unlikely game types. The character development in the game is based solely on how the player wants the characters to play out. Like in games such as Diablo, once a character levels up you're granted extra stat points which you can distribute among the over six different traits. These traits govern how a player advances over the course of the game. Guns, swords, magic, and other oddities make up the roster of weapons that you make use of during the game. </div>  <div> Setting : Being one of the most unique settings in a JRPG, Koudelka takes place in an old building which stands on top of a religious site. The manor that the beginning portion of the game takes place in creates a heavy atmosphere. It is very similar to something one may find in Resident Evil or Silent Hill. The enemies in the game are also extremely varied, and represent deformed versions of everyday people and animals. Giant beetles, deformed humans, wolf men, walking armour, and many other horror characters make their presence known in the creeking halls of this old building. The cinematics and the sound design in the game also add to the sense of urgency as you run through the corridors attempting to find your objective. </div>  <div> Overall : Koudelka is a game which marriages many classical role-playing elements, while adding an entirely new theme and focus thanks to the story. The combination of grid based and turn-based gameplay is an unlikely union, but adds to the human feel of the characters themselves. Koudelka is an oddity among JRPG games, and relies on the horror theme to an extreme. Being the predecessor to Shadow Hearts, one can expect many satanical and cult themes within the game. This is a classic JRPG for those looking for a unique experience unlike anything else they have experienced in the genre. </div> "

Kula World,Game Design Sweden AB,Psygnosis,"November 30, 1998",ps,"Roll Away, known as ""Kula World"" in Europe and ""Kula Quest"" in Japan, is a three-dimensional puzzle game wherein the player must navigate a beach ball through suspended platforms. It was developed by Game Design Sweden AB for the Playstation and was published by Sony in 1998.",3030-27176,27176,0,1998-11-20,https://www.giantbomb.com/roll-away/3030-27176/,PEGI: 3+," <div> Overview : Roll Away was released by Sony for the PlayStation in 1998 and was developed by Game Design Sweden AB. It was one of the first games to take advantage of the Dual Shock controller. Kula in the original title ‚ÄúKula World‚Äù (as the game was known in Europe) is the swedish word for ‚Äúball‚Äù. It was subsequently re-released via PlayStation Network (in Europe in 2007 and in Japan in 2009) as a part of the ‚ÄúPS One Classics‚Äù line ‚Äì a version which was ultimately compatible with PS3, PSP, and PS Vita. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Roll Away the player takes control of a beach ball and has to navigate it through stationary platforms that are suspended in mid-air. The objective is to find one or more keys before trying to reach the exit in time. The defining characteristic of the ball is that it sticks to the surface of any side of the platform. Keys and exits become harder to get to and the player must find ways to circumvent traps and obstacles. The ball can be made to jump over these obstacles or across platforms, as well as down onto lower platforms. If the ball falls off the platform or if the ball is spiked by objects, the game will spawn the player at the beginning of the level. Various beneficial items such as coins, gems and pieces of fruit contribute to the player's score. A score penalty is taken when failing the objective or restarting the level mid-game. When the player's score falls below 0, the game is over. </div>  <div> Level Design : Levels are very small in size but the placement of obstacles and the multi angled nature of the puzzles make them difficult over time. Multiple platforms are often close to each other but are only accessible by changing the perspective of the ball. This can be done by jumping onto a lower platform or by tackling a platform from one of several directions. Platforms that are interconnected with each other but aren't floating on the same height can be approached by one of their corners in order to roll the ball onto another side of the platform. The perspective changes but the ball sticks to the surface. </div>  <div> Stage Types : The player must navigate the level, locate all the keys and make it to the exit. </div>  <div> Items : After collecting the 5 fruits the player gets taken to a bonus level where the player has to 'paint' all the purple platforms yellow by rolling over them. When all the platforms are painted the level is complete. Failing a bonus stage cannot be retried. </div>  <div> Obstacles : Certain stages have a secret exit that looks like the regular exit but is transparent. It appears when all the keys in said level have been collected. Secret stages play like regular levels but like bonus stages cannot be retried when failed. </div>  <div> Gameplay Modes : Bronze Coin: A bronze coin worth 250 points.Silver Coin: A silver coin worth 500 points.Gold Coin: A gold coin worth 750 points.Key: Keys are required to complete the levels worth 1000 points.Gems: Different coloured gems differing in value.Fruit: 2500 points.

When the player grabs the hour glass and their new remaining time is 15 seconds the point value is 150.Pill: A pill that slows the player down and makes the screen blurry. Speeds up the timer.

The game was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Eidos Interactive. Soul Reaver tells the tale of Kain's first lieutenant, Raziel, as he seeks revenge on his master. The game drops the static top-down camera from the first game for a third person view. The gameplay focuses mainly on puzzles and action adventure. In a twist from the last game, Kain is now the antagonist.On December 6th, 2012 Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was released as a digital download on the Steam store for PC. </div>  <div> Plot : RazielMany centuries have passed since Kain had to make the fateful decision at the end of Blood Omen. The game starts on the premise that Kain refused to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth, heal the land, and ensure the extinction of vampires, but instead chose to rule a decaying world. He has raised six vampire lieutenants and they have created multiple clans and established an empire over Nosgoth. Over the course of time Kain and his lieutenants have evolved and have become less human and more divine in nature. Kain was always the first one to evolve and his lieutenants would soon follow. Until Raziel, his first lieutenant, developed a pair of wings before him. In a fit of jealous rage Kain viciously tears off Raziel's wings and condemns him to an eternity of pain and suffering by casting him into the waters of the Lake of the Dead.But all was not lost for Raziel survived thanks to an ancient deity called The Elder God. The Elder God confided to Raziel many truths and revelations of creation, death, souls and hunger. It seems Kain's impudent vampire dynasty was depriving The Elder from Nosgoth souls, which it had been devouring for eons. The Elder offered Raziel a chance of revenge against Kain and his traitorous followers: Agree to walk the material plane and dispatch his former brethren. Upon agreement to this Raziel is transformed into a wraith who now hungers for souls, not blood. We follow his tale as he seeks vengeance on his brethren and Kain.Raziel later discovers that he was actually an inquisitor of vampires in his human life before he died and was resurrected by Kain as his first lieutenant. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Soul Reaver's gameplay was drastically different from Blood Omen. While the game still has the same morbid atmosphere, the camera has been changed to a dynamic third person view. Players can now stop and look around at their surroundings. The game features an abundance of puzzles, though most of them are simplistic and require little effort to complete. The game actually got some criticism for its numerous block puzzles, which started to feel repetitive towards the end of the game.The action and combat in the game followed the traditional hack and slash method, where players can use a standard primary and secondary attack to beat down their opponents. Raziel can pick up any weapon from his surrounding to dispose his enemies. He can kill his vampire foes by impaling them, drowning them in water, exposing them to sunlight or setting them on fire. Some of the boss fights require a bit of puzzle solving as Raziel has to use the environment to deal with them. Combat changes quite a bit once Raziel gets a hold of his wraith blade - the Soul Reaver. The blade sustains him in the material realm and you don't need to go looking for vampires to satisfy your hunger. His wraith blade also gains additional powers throughout the course of the game, such as the ability to fire bolts of energy that knock enemies back, the ability to take on the essence of fire to dispatch foes quickly, and the combination of the two which allows for the immolation of enemies from a distance.A major aspect of the game revolved around Raziel shifting in and out of the spirit realm. Since he can't die, Raziel just goes back into the Spirit Realm when weakened. He can also willingly shift in and out using planar portals spread throughout Nosgoth. These play an important part in all the puzzles as Raziel can pass through certain obstacles in the spectral realm but he can only open doors in the material realm. Players have to think their way through some puzzles to avoid excessive backtracking. </div>  <div> Environment : The games environment has a steampunk feel to it as the vampires have created huge factories to black out the skies. Nosgoth is a state of decay as Kain's empire has corrupted the world to its core. The age of the vampires seem to be on the decline as most of their monuments are falling apart. The overall atmosphere of the game is very dark and morbid. </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : Minimum:OS:Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7Processor:1.8 GHz ProcessorMemory:512 MB RAMGraphics:3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7DirectX¬Æ:7.0Hard Drive:2 GB HD space </div> "

Each character has the usual options of attacking, defending, using an item, or running. What makes the battle system unique is that an attack is formed through inputting a combination of directions with the D-pad, each direction corresponding to a different type of physical attack. Certain special combinations are known as Arts, and are saved in a list once they've been executed. Each character has their own unique list of attacks, and they all have a different combination of directions to input. There are also Super arts and Hyper arts which can be learned by reading books found throughout the game, or by talking with certain NPCs.You are limited in your actions depending on your AP. Your action bar will expand with leveling, but you also need to power yourself up to max out your input abilities in any given turn. Everyone has a default action bar length, but the more powerful attacks and combinations require more AP.Characters with a Ra-Seru can also summon other Serus after they have been absorbed in battle. Absorbing Serus in battle is as easy as fighting them, and they are collected automatically. From there on out you can summon them in battle. Each of them has their own skills and powers, and thus come in handy in different situations. Serus will level up with use, and so their powers will become stronger as well. </div>  <div> Characters : Vahn: The main character and protagonist of the game. Vahn lives in the town of Rim Elm with his father Val and his little sister Nene. Vahn's weapon of choice is a sword or knife, and controls the Ra-Seru Meta - the fire element. Vahn grew up learning martial arts under Tetsu, a Biron monk, and is an efficient fighter because of it.Noa: Noa is an orphan who was raised by the Ra-Seru Terra. Terra had attached itself to a wolf to better protect Noa while she was growing up. Noa grew up in Snowdrift Cave and lived their her whole life which gave her a very childish and ignorant personality. The world is a mystery to Noa but she is ready to learn and joins Vahn on his quest to rid the world of the mist.Gala: Gala is a Biron Monk, second in command at the monastery and a Master Teacher. He joins up to help Vahn get to one of the Genesis trees, but they arrive too late and the tree has died. He finds a Ra-Seru egg inside the tree, and later on it hatches as Ozma. Against the rules of the monastery, Gala combines with Ozma and joins Vahn and Noa on their journey. </div>  <div> Seru : Seru are separated into 7 different classes: Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Thunder, Light and Dark.

Legend of Mana,Square,"JPSquare, NASquare Electronic Arts","June 7, 2000",ps,Unlock sidequests and save the world in Square's follow up to Secret of Mana.,3030-15900,15900,0,1999-07-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/legend-of-mana/3030-15900/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Legend of Mana, the fourth entry in Square Enix's enormously popular Seiken Densetsu series (known as the Mana series in the U.S.), is the followup to the cult SNES classic Secret of Mana. Striking some controversy with the fan base, Legend of Mana introduced the ""Land Make"" system, requiring players to ""plant"" new areas to which to travel and forward the story. The premise for this mechanic roots from the destruction of the world, leaving the player to restore it by locating items corresponding to different land areas. Placement of these artifacts on the map relative to the home area or other locations and the order in which they are placed determines items, battles and quests the player will discover there. As the story is not at all linear, and essentially a series of side quests linked by several story arcs, the player can pursue the quests and place the artifacts as they see fit. This has led to criticism that the game's story is shallow, as it is essentially a run of connected (some less so) side quests, several of which the player may be locked out of completing depending on the order in which certain story arcs are pursued. </div>  <div> Gameplay : There are several elements of play that define Legend of Mana, most notably that its combat takes place in real time, as opposed to the traditional turn-based system expressed predominately in the Final Fantasy franchise, meaning the player had direct control over the character. While the player exerts no control over the other members of its party, another player can via the second controller, effectively creating a somewhat limited multiplayer experience. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : In addition to the NPC s recruited by the main character through the story, the character will also encounter eggs that they will be able to raise into pets through the monster corral, one of several elements unlocked via side quests associated with the main characters home. These pets can be fostered into companions with their own special abilities to improve combat situations. Note, these pets could be raised using the Sony PocketStation peripheral, exclusive to Japan and also used in Final Fantasy VIII.As well as the monster corral, the main character can unlock an orchard to grow fruit. The character provides seeds to the orchard keeper, an anthropomorphic tree. The amount and kind of seeds distributed, as well as the levels of mana on the home area of the map, determine the fruit produced.Further, related to the home area of the main character, a workshop area also exists, again, much as above, unlocked upon completion of a side quest. Using various raw materials, the player can create various instruments, weapons, armor and golems. The golems, much like the pets and other NPCs, accompany the player and provide aid in combat. </div> "

Lego Rock Raiders,Data Design Interactive,Lego Media,"August 17, 2000",ps,"LEGO Rock Raiders is a real-time strategy/building game in which you direct the Rock Raiders to mine energy Crystals so that the miners can go home.
The PlayStation version of the game is completely different, instead of being an RTS the PlayStation version is mission-based with objectives.",3030-9975,9975,0,1999-11-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/lego-rock-raiders/3030-9975/,ESRB: E," <div> Story : The rock raiders crew are about to embark on a journey home to earth when their ship, the LMS Explorer, flies into an asteroid field. The ship becomes badly damaged and to make matters worse, they are sucked into a wormhole, taking the crew off course. When they come to, they realize that the ship is in an alternate galaxy far away from their own. With the ship running on emergency power, they find a nearby planet that is rich in energy crystals. Their only chance to make it home is to collect enough energy crystals to power the ship so they are able to fly back home. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like most RTS games, you are given a set of objectives to complete. Most of these objectives normally involve finding lost rock raiders or collecting a set number of energy crystals. The enemies of the game are not opposing factions, but rather the environment. For example, some missions involve acquiring a set number of energy crystals before lava engulfs your entire base. Other enemies often involve Rock Monsters, Ice Monsters, and Lava Monsters which attempt to destroy your base. One special monster involves the Slimy Slug in which it saps your base of energy should it manage to sneak into your base. Each of them has a weakness and it's up to the player to exploit them.Typically, the player starts by teleporting rock raiders to the planet to start the mining process. From there, they may drill walls extract energy crystals which can add to your mission objective completion, or to power your base. The ore may also be found which are generally used to build structures for your base.In addition to Rock Raiders, mining vehicles may also be teleported down provided that you have enough energy crystals. They can aid in extraction, to clear debris, or quickly scout the area. To operate vehicles, however rock raiders must be trained to use them.Rock Raiders can be trained in many different areas such as geology, driving, piloting, sailing, and explosives. Geology will allow the radar to pick up seams of energy crystals and ores much easier. Driving, piloting, and sailing allow rock raiders to operate respective vehicles that require those skills. Explosives allow rock raiders without mining vehicles to destroy hard rock seams. When Rock Raiders ""die"" they are teleported to safety. They do not technically since the game provides each rock raider with an energy shield which depletes as they take damage. When they get damaged enough, they are teleported back to the ship. If they are teleported back to the ship, you lose that Rock Raider forever, meaning that all past accomplishments and training are gone. </div>  <div> Structures : Although the main goal is to collect energy crystals, some structures are needed in order to make said goal either faster or possible. The buildings can be upgraded so that their features are improved or added.Tool StoreThe tool store is the default structure that every base starts with. Not only is this the only structure that does not require power to operate, it also acts essentially as the foothold of the entire base until a power station is built. Typically, all extraneous supplies you collect will be stored here, meaning that ore and unused energy crystals will be stored here. Should you order a Rock Raider to obtain items, they will retrieve them here as well. The tool store also acts as a teleport pad until you construct a working one later on. Explosives experts may also be trained here.Teleport PadAlthough it isn't functional when you first build it, the building itself is a requirement in order to build a power station. Unlike the tool store, the teleport pad will allow you to teleport small vehicles to the planet. In addition to being a teleport pad, you can oddly enough train pilots here.Power StationThe power station is the heart of the base...as well as the target of 3/4 of all attacks done by slimy slugs and the elemental monsters. When built, it powers your entire base as long as you have the energy crystal requirements.DocksBuilding docks allows you to teleport water-based vehicles. It will also allow you to train sailors.Support StationThe support station is the most crucial building you'll have next to the power station. Without it, you will not be able to produce the oxygen that is needed for your Rock Raiders to keep working. With this building, you can train drivers and your rock raiders will automatically take breaks so they don't tire themselves out. A support station will also increase the cap amount of Rock Raiders you are able to teleport to the planet.Geological CentreThis is where you can train geologists and allows you to have a radar map of the entire area.Mining LaserThis building allows you to shoot lasers to destroy most rock within a few hits. Bear in mind that a few shots will eat up an energy crystal.Ore RefineryOre Refineries will allow you to refine ore into lego blocks so that it does not take as much ore to create a building.Large Teleport PadThis structure will allow you to teleport the big daddies of all mining vehicles. </div>  <div> PlayStation Version : The PlayStation version gets rid of the RTS aspect and replaces it completely with objective-based missions.Most missions require you to either find and collect energy crystals or lost raiders sometimes even both, some missions must be completed in a certain amount of time.Depending on how well you do in a mission you will be rewarded with a medal at the end of the mission.There are three medals; Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Earning all gold medals unlocks special missions.The PAL and the NTSC versions of the game have different missions.The missions for the NTSC release of the game are slightly easier compared to its PAL counterpart. </div> "

Competition for this mana led to bitter rivalry and a turn towards the black arts. A cataclysmic event changed the face of the world and a wizard's apprentice is charged with restoring order. </div>  <div> Release Information : Magic Carpet was released for PC (DOS) in 1994. An expansion for the game, Hidden Worlds, providing 25 additional levels, was released in 1995. This was bundled with the main game in Magic Carpet Plus, a compilation which was also used as the basis for the 1996 console ports for Sega Saturn and PlayStation. </div>  <div> Gameplay : There are 3 objectives:Build and defend a castleCollect all available manaDestroy all creatures and wizardsA level is complete when the target for mana collection is reached.The castle is essential, acting as a respawn point and a store for collected mana. Without a castle, the player must restart the level if they die. Castles can be upgraded from a single building (level 1) to a 4 x 4 outer wall structure (level 7), with 1 to 3 balloons collecting mana. The player is invulnerable while inside the castle boundaries as it absorbs any damage. An ongoing attack or a large amount of damage will force the castle to downsize to a previous level, spilling excess mana into the surrounding area.Mana acts as a source of power for all spells. This spell power regenerates over time, and a preset amount of mana is required before the more powerful spells can be used. A wizard can change the state of mana balls using the possess spell. Neutral mana balls are orange; otherwise adopting the colour of the wizard that possessed them. Mana can be found in clusters around the level and appears when creatures are killed. If a wizard dies, another wizard can possess their corpse and in turn any of their uncollected mana. </div>  <div> Creatures : Early levels are populated with weaker creatures like giant bees, worms and birds. Crabs, griffins and kraken feature in later levels, using fireballs, meteors and lightning. Creatures will attack the player, other wizards and castles. The most powerful creature is the Wyvern, fast and deadly, immune to the Rebound spell and armed with Rapid Fireball. </div>  <div> Spells : New spells are collected on the earlier levels as urns. If a wizard is killed carrying one of the new spells, this will be dropped as an urn with their corpse for other wizards to collect.Fireball - the basic attack spellPossess - converts mana from a neutral state or steals it from another wizard. Also used to possess civilian buildings for a mana bonus.Accelerate (forwards) - a temporary speed boostCastle - creates or upgrades the player's base on the level, can be used on land or waterHeal - restores health until the player's mana is depletedRebound - deflects fireballs and meteors back at the creature or wizard that fired them. Mana will not regenerate while rebound is active.Shield - reduces damage caused by wizard spells to 25%Invisible - creatures and wizards are oblivious to your presence. Invisibility is broken when the player casts a spell.Earthquake - digs a channel through the terrainMeteor - an area-of-effect weapon, devastating when fired rapidly at wizards and their castlesCrater - weaker than Earthquake, creates a small craterVolcano - creates a volcano, useful for destroying enemy castles due to the ongoing eruptionsLightning - fires lightning bolts which lock onto a targetLightning storm - another area-of-effect weaponSkeleton army - raises an army of undead archers that will attack castles, balloons and wizardsMana magnet - consolidates mana balls in a radius into one larger ball, hastening mana collection and defence of uncollected manaSteal mana - regenerate your spell power by stealing it from another wizardBeyond sight - displays the location of other wizards on the mapDuel - locks wizards together so neither can escape until one uses Accelerate or diesTeleport - warps the player back to their castle. Casting again returns the player to the previous location.Wall of fire - creates a wall of fireAccelerate (reverse) - a temporary speed boostGlobal Death - a smart bomb. A bell will sound, followed by a purple flash. Creatures and wizards in range die instantly.Rapid fireball - fires a rapid stream of fireballs at the expense of a heavy mana drain </div>  <div> Trivia : The final level of the PC version was bugged, making it impossible to collect all of the mana and trigger the victory condition. Electronic Arts would supply a fixed version of the level on floppy disk.The PC version ran under DOS/4GW. Firing a rapid succession of volcanoes would often lead to a general protection fault, crashing back to DOS.In  an interview with Giant Bomb,  Peter Molyneux said that the core idea of the game, which is flying around on a magical carpet, is ""the stupidest thing ever"", and that he wishes that  Bullfrog had made a  corridor-shooter, which he asserts would've been much more successful. </div> "

The group received a second C&D from Minori when they announced plans to translate Eden*, another Minori title, which lead to a negotiation between the two parties. The exchange, surprisingly, lead to No Name Losers and Minori creating a partnership with MangaGamer to publish an official English release of Ef. This partnership eventually lead to MangaGamer localizing several other Minori titles, including Eden*, Supipara and Trinoline. </div>  <div> Story : Each installment is broken down into a prologue and two chapters which follow a different protagonist each time.The story takes branching pathways and work towards the conclusion of one of four overarching story conclusions- one for each girl. </div>  <div> Other Media : The Prologue takes place a year after the events of the game, and bookends each chapter with the conversations of a dapper gentleman (Yu Himura) and a nun (Yuko Amamiya) reminiscing of the events in upcoming chaptersChapter 1 revolves around the protagonist Hiro Hirono- an established manga author and highschool student, and his interactions with schoolmate Miyako MiyamuraChapter 2 takes place a few months after the events of the first, and focuses on a friend of Hiro's named Kyosuke Tsutsumi- a budding filmmaker infatuated with a mysterious girl and fellow student he catches a glimpse of one Christmas night. </div>  <div> Trivia : The Prologue once again opens with Yu and Yuko, this time speaking of the events of the first game.

This may have something to do he fact that keys are inexplicably consumed when used to unlock doors,  Zelda-style, so if players unlock a door requiring a green tag, they will need to locate another green tag to open the next green door. It also likely suffered because of the nature of the game's primary enemies, the ""Non-Dead"". These enemies cannot be permanently killed, and after being shot, will re-animate and resume the attack the next time the player re-enters the same area. Given that there is a limited amount of ammo in the game's world, and an unlimited amount of enemies, fighting the Non-Dead is an exercise in futility and frustration. </div>  <div> Story : The year is 2018. Players control a team of three specialist astronauts, sent to the Vita-1 base on  Mars from Earth, to ascertain exactly what has happened to the Vita-1 crew; no communication with this base has been heard for many months. On the basis of a garbled message sent by an astronaut on the base; ""Stay alone, stay alive"", it is clear that something dreadful has happened. Following the cryptic advice of the message, the three astronauts enter the base through three separate airlocks, and find themselves confined to separate sections of the base by sealed bulkheads. When the specialists explore the base they find it deserted, with mutilated corpses scattered everywhere, and it is unclear what caused the downfall of the base. One thing is clear however; Vita-1 hides a dark, terrible secret somehow related to Mars' distant past... </div>  <div> Characters : The game features three playable characters, who the player can switch between at any time. Time continues to pass for all three characters, so if the player leaves a character in a room with an enemy, that enemy will take the opportunity to murder that character while they stand there helpless. The game ends if any of the three die. </div> "

It is based on the crossover event comic series The Infinity Gauntlet, which also serves as the base for Capcom's 1996 platformer Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems.Along with spin-off series (the Marvel vs. Capcom series), the game received ports to the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation worldwide throughout 1997 (with the European versions published by Virgin), adding the ability to play as boss characters (with special cheat codes) and adding a new hidden guest character (Anita from Night Warriors: Darkstalkers' Revenge).The original version was later digitally re-released in a bundle (with Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes) for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) in September 25, 2012 as Marvel vs. Capcom Origins, including online multiplayer, graphical filters and 3D viewing angles, and a challenge system (where players can unlock bonus content by completing challenges in the game). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay system used in Marvel Super Heroes is similar to its predecessor, X-Men: Children of the Atom, including multi-screen vertical jumps. Marvel Super Heroes adds Infinity Supers and the Infinity Gem System (below) . Also new for Marvel Super Heroes is the Aerial Rave, which allows the player to continue a combo after the opponent has been launched into the air.Marvel Super Heroes also introduced the iconic Infinity Supers, such as Iron Man's ""Proton Cannon"", Spider-Man's ""Maximum Spider"", and Hulk's ""Gamma Crush"". Some of the X-Men characters, like Wolverine and Psylocke, have more than one infinity super. </div>  <div> Characters : The six Infinity Gems. Note that the colors have changed in the game. During each fight, players can collect Infinity Gems that can grant special temporary powers for their character. In Arcade mode, players start with all of their possessed Gems (while the enemy may have one Gem of their own), which reset after every match. In Versus matches, players start with no Gems and can only receive them after a player receives the First Damage bonus and when a player's lifebar is almost empty.Players can activate their currently possessed Gem by inputting a special motion (Down, Down-Back, Back, then all three Punch buttons simultaneously) and can only activate one Gem at a time. Players can swap between Gems by pressing the Start button (provided they did not do the Taunt motion). Once a Gem's effect is complete, it is removed from play.All of the playable characters have their own special effect when activating their preferred gem.Power Gem (Violet) - Increases damage of the character's attacks. Both Captain America and Wolverine also have after-shadows behind them, potentially tripling the effects of their attacks, while Spider-Man and Psylocke also create mirror images to confuse and boost their attack power. In Arcade mode, players start with the Power Gem.Time Gem (Red) - Speeds up the character's movement. Hulk can also perform Fierce and Roundhouse attacks much faster, while Shuma-Gorath's normal attacks can also petrify his opponent.Reality Gem (Orange) - Adds elemental projectiles to all of the character's attacks. Blackheart also turns completely invisible.Soul Gem (Green) - Slowly regenerates the character's health over time. Iron Man also gains electrical damage from his attacks (adding a nerf that slowly steals his opponent's Infinity Gauge over time).Space Gem (Indigo) - Gives the character an ""armor"" (similar to Juggernaut) that increases defense makes them tougher to knock down. Magneto also has a force field that completely negates damage, while Juggernaut also takes almost zero damage from attacks and is nearly-impossible to knock down.Mind Gem (Blue) - Slowly regenerates the character's Infinity Gauge over time. In Arcade mode, players cannot use this Gem until the final battle against Thanos, where they would have to take the five other Gems from him before being able to take the Mind Gem.At the start of the final battle with Thanos, all of the player's Gems are immediately taken by him. The computer-controlled Thanos does not activate Gems and instead has powerful Infinity Combos based on each Gem. When Thanos loses a Gem, he also loses access to that corresponding Infinity Combo. Player-controlled Thanos can still activate all of his Infinity Combos, regardless of Gem possession. </div> "

The second installment of the Marvel vs. Capcom crossover series (and sequel to X-Men vs. Street Fighter), the game pits fighters from Marvel Super Heroes (with some X-Men fighters from the previous installment) with the fighters from Street Fighter Alpha 2. This installment adds the concept of ""assist attacks"", in which the player can call the backup character, who jump into the action and performs a quick special move before jumping back out.The game was ported to the Saturn (in Japanese regions only) on October 22, 1998 and PlayStation on January 31, 1999. While the Saturn version retains all animations and the tag-team mechanic of the arcade version (thanks to the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge), the PlayStation version removes the tag-team mechanics for normal gameplay (restricting it to traditional 1v1 round-based fights, in which the secondary character plays an ""assist"" role), re-adding the Crossover mode from the port of the previous installment. (in which the tag-team mechanic is brought back, but each player's secondary character is the opposing player's primary character) </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chun-Li and Sakura Performing a SuperThe game uses the same tag-team format which was previously introduced in X-Men Vs. Street Fighter. A new feature was added to the game, the ability to call an assist attack from your other character. This allows the player to call in their partner to perform one of their special moves without having to change the character they are currently controlling.Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter's gameplay is an iteration on the earlier Vs Seres games. Combos can be started from the ground then launch the opponent into the air and continue the combo (known as ""air combo""), and the player can finish it all off with a super combo. The game features the standard Capcom six button interface with two rows of three buttons.The single player game, being arcade mode is similar to the previous title, having the player pick a tag-team, then versing other tag-teams, and again ends with a two-on-one match against Apocalypse. Instead of having the player have a one-on-one match with their tag-team partner, the player has to verse a Cyborg version of Akuma in a two-on-one match. The character who deals the finishing blow to Cyborg Akuma will then have their ending shown.This game reuses many of the same backgrounds as X-Men Vs. Street Fighter with only minor changes being made. </div>  <div> Characters : Like X-Men vs. Street Fighter, the game includes 17 playable characters on the select screen (eight from the Marvel Super Heroes side and nine from the Street Fighter side). In Japanese versions, an extra character (Norimaro) is playable. New from the previous installment is the concept of hidden alternate versions of some characters, each with different palettes (with the exception of Cyber-Akuma, who has entirely new sprites) and minor gameplay differences. </div> "

It also adds dedicated characters for the ""assist attack"" (known as ""partners"") and a special combination attack (known as the ""Duo Team Attack"", which temporarily allows the player to control both of their fighters simultaneously).The game was ported to the Dreamcast on September 30, 1999, adding a new game mode (called ""Cross Fever"") that allows four-player simultaneous gameplay. It was later ported to the PlayStation on January 31, 2000, restricting the tag-team mechanic to the ""Cross Over"" mode (where each player's secondary fighter is the same as the opposing player's primary fighter). Like the PS1 ports of the series's previous games, normal gameplay uses traditional round-based 1v1 fights (where players can choose between a ""partner"" or another fighter as their assist character).The original version was later digitally re-released in a bundle (with Marvel Super Heroes) for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) in September 25, 2012 as Marvel vs. Capcom Origins, including online multiplayer, graphical filters and 3D viewing angles, and a challenge system (where players can unlock bonus content by completing challenges in the game). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ryu unleashing his superMarvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes was distinguishable from the rest in the series due to the ability to call upon the help from ""assist"" characters, as well as the ability to perform a special attack where both of the characters would be in the field at the same time. The game plays quicker than other 2D fighting games at the time. Play focuses heavily on quick reactions, smart team management, and both solo and team super moves.In addition, this game introduced the Duo Team Attack. In the Duo Team Attack, both characters on the team could be controlled simultaneously and had an unlimited use of super moves during the time. In the PlayStation version, the Duo Team Attack worked where the assist character could be summoned repeatedly during this time. The game starts off and the player gets to choose two characters. Then, the fighting starts, with randomly selected pairs of other characters gradually increasing in difficulty until the final boss, Onslaught. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes 15 playable characters at the start, one secret fighter, five secret variations, and one unplayable final boss (with two forms).It is the first entry in the series to include Capcom characters outside of the Street Fighter series and replaces most of their part of the previous game's roster with them (leaving only Ryu, Chun-Li, and Zangief). It is also the first game in the series to include War Machine (based on the sprites used for Iron Man in Marvel Super Heroes). </div> "

In it, the player takes control of Kurt Hectic, a janitor of the eccentric Dr. Fluke Hawkins. Without warning, aliens known as Stream Riders invade Earth, and are using city size mining machines to harvest its natural resources, and whatever else gets in their way. However, the good doctor has foreseen this threat and plans a counter attack. He entrusts his latest inventions, including the ""amazing"" Coil Suit, and the ""extraordinary"" chain-gun, to our hero Kurt. With the occasional help of his six-legged canine companion Bones (AKA, Max), Kurt takes the fight into the heart of the enemy stronghold.KurtBattles take place in large arenas linked by tunnels (which are actually just cleverly disguised loading screens). After dispatching various waves of enemies, Kurt moves on to the next arena. The variety of the arenas is a highlight, from typical war zones to prisons to childish painted walls that add to the game's bizarre sense of humor. How many other games feature "" the world's smallest nuclear bomb""? As a treat for fans of Earthworm Jim (Shiny's key franchise), some levels included cows falling from the sky onto enemies if the right power-up was found.MDK's developers capitalized on ground breaking Motion Capture technology. This led to some of the best animation and graphics of its day. It also provided spectacular environments and some of the most original concepts seen in gaming. From the bizarre head gear Kurt is forced to wear, which doubles as a sniper rifle and chain gun, to the ""incredible"" ribbon chute, MDK's character design makes it one of the more original PC shooters. It found itself on consoles soon after. </div>  <div> Story : MDK's story is set in the form of a diary of an eccentric inventor, named Dr. Fluke Hawkins. Dr. Hawkins discovers something that he humorously calls ""Flange Orbits,"" but when he relates this to the scientific community, he is shunned and ridiculed.Dr. Fluke Hawkins then goes out to build a space station, which he names 'The Jim Dandy.' He then bribes his laboratory janitor (Kurt Hectic) to join him by giving him some Hungarian goulash, and blasts himself into a self-imposed exile in outer space, swearing never to return until he ""comes up with some really good stuff."" Upon entering orbit, he realizes that the ""Flange Orbits"" he theorized about didn't actually exist. Rather than go back to Earth humiliated, he begins to work on a robotic dog that Dr. Hawkins calls ""Bones"" (the dog prefers "" Max"").Inside a MinecrawlerDr. Hawkins continues work in harmony until he one day notices a strange phenomenon: long streams of some sort of energy are heading straight for the Earth. The Doctor sent down a warning (along with a basket of Max's delicious oranges) but was promptly ignored. The streams proceeded to create massive hordes of enemies in ""Minecrawlers,"" giant fortress-cities designed to strip the mineral wealth (and potato crop, according to Dr. Hawkins) from the planet. The military forces of Earth were swiftly crushed by the alien invasion.Dr. Hawkins decides to take immediate action. Pairing his new ""Coil Suit"", a revolutionary, futuristic armor suit capable of repelling ""bullets, bees, and small but very hard sticks"" that holds a retractable/re-usable ""ribbon chute"" for parachuting and/or gliding. The suit also contains an arm-mounted chaingun that also serves as a head-mounted sniper rifle, Dr. Hawkins had the perfect weapons suit at his disposal but there was one problem. Kurt was the only one who could wear it, due to the Doctor's age and Max's extra pair of legs.Sniper view from within Kurt's helmetSo Kurt, begrudgingly, was dispatched on ""Mission: Deliver Kindness,"" entering the Minecrawlers from above, and destroying them from the inside-out. He shot his way through to the ""drivers,"" typically killing them in some rather violent fashion. Kurt fought his way though all the Minecrawlers, destroying them one by one, until he eventually came to meet Gunter Glut, the hideous leader of the alien invasion.Kurt destroyed the final Minecrawler but Glut managed to escape with Max in captivity, Kurt gives chase along a stream leading to the alien homeworld. In the end, Kurt frees Max and kills Glut, ending the game. The ending is a surreal, monochrome mix of a French pop music video and clips from MDK for no discernible reason. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : CD CoverThe cinematic-like soundtrack was composed and produced by Todd Dennis and Tommy Tallarico, which managed to aid the visual narrative and help shape the world of MDK.

As with previous games in the MechWarrior 2 line, gameplay focuses on the actions of large BattleMechs (or 'Mechs) in various combat situations, with an emphasis on simulation-style controls over straightforward action. Unlike the previous games, Mercenaries includes an detailed economy in which players can salvage parts from the battlefield and purchase new 'Mechs with the credits earned from their missions. While it uses the MechWarrior 2 graphics engine, Mercenaries features a number of tweaks such as more detailed textures and lighting.¬†¬†While MechWarrior 2 and its expansion Ghost Bear's Legacy focused on Clan activites, Mercenaries' story unfolds from the perspective of an Inner Sphere mercenary. Due to this change, many new Inner Sphere 'Mechs are introduced in Mercenaries, with the total number of usable vehicles being more than twice that of the previous games.  </div>  <div> Plot :  Happening before the Refusal War conflict depicted in MechWarrior 2, the plot of Mercenaries focuses on an independent mercenary unit taking contracts from various factions within the Inners Sphere. The War of 3039 has recently ended, and it is a period of relative calm, with both major powers, the Draconis Combine and the Federated Commonwealth, recuperating and rebuilding in order to prepare for their next war. The player can take various jobs from either faction, as well as from others such as Comstar and the Free Rasalhague Republic, in addition to participating in closed arena competitions.¬†The player's mercenary activities are abruptly interrupted by the Clan invasion, and during the latter part of the game their mercenary unit is swept up in the ensuing war. The final event depicted in the campaign is the Battle of Tukayyid, the decisive confrontation between the Clans and the Inner Sphere that precipitated the Refusal War of MechWarrior 2. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  The Starport functions as the hub for all activities during the campaign. The gameplay of MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries remains largely unchanged over previous iterations in the series. Players are still required to display adept handling of various BattleMechs while¬†simultaneously¬†keeping tabs on its various systems, such as heat dissipation,¬†targeting, and radar display. While the missions themselves are unchanged, Mercenaries allows a larger degree of freedom outside of battle by giving players more control of the specifics leading up to each engagement. From their office players are allowed to purchase and sell 'Mechs, hire new pilots, and decide which missions to take. Furthermore, players must be aware of the game's economy even during missions, as performance determines what is salvaged; anything from individual parts to full 'Mech chassis can be taken from the battlefield.¬†The single-player component of Mercenaries is split into three modes: Mercenary Commander, Mercenary, and Instant Action. Mercenary Commander is the main campaign mode, with all of Mercenaries' economic elements enabled, while Mercenary is a simplified version of the campaign which plays more similar to previous games in the series.¬†Finally, Instant Action is a slightly expanded version of the Trials of Grievance and Combat Simulation modes of the past two games.

Medal of Honor,DreamWorks Interactive,Electronic Arts,"October 31, 1999",ps,Step into the boots of Tier 1 Operatives Rabbit and Deuce in this modern take on EA's long-running Medal of Honor series; the game features separately-developed single player and multiplayer modes.,3030-29336,29336,0,2010-10-12,https://www.giantbomb.com/medal-of-honor/3030-29336/,OFLC: MA15+," <div> Overview : Medal of Honor focuses on the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, referred to as ""Operation Enduring Freedom"", as the US led invasion forces fight Taliban insurgents. In campaign the player will control several Tier 1 Operators, that liken themselves as the ""scalpel"" of the U.S. war machine, whose missions favor restraint and require discretion. Also playable in the single player are U.S. Army Rangers, the ""hammer"" of U.S. coalition forces. Multiplayer features standard deathmatch, as well as objective based modes, where players can select from multiple classes including special ops, assault and recon specialists.Actual US troops deployed in the Shah-i-Kot valley.The game centres around one particular battle: the Battle of Shah-i-Kot. This battle was part of Operation Anaconda. This large scale operation had as a goal to root out Taliban forces hiding in the surrounding mountains. The operation was lead from March 1, 2002 until March 19, 2002. The American lead coalition succeeded in hunting the Taliban out of the region and as the game indicates, the Taliban numbers were estimated to be up to 1,000 troops strong. The operation involved both US and Afghan forces, like in the game, and the Taliban suffered losses of about 500 causalities which is probably the body count the player will find themselves with by the end of the game. Of course, the Generals and Colonels leading the operation don't have the same names as the ones who lead the actual operation (Anaconda was lead in real life by LTG. Franklin L. Hagenbeck).In the game, the player is tasked with capturing the Bagram Airfield. This airfield really exists and has been under US control since December 2001. This airfield is extremely important as it houses part of the US Marines and air forces in Afghanistan. It's also one of the few airfields in Afghanistan where Air Force One is authorized to land.The Tier 1 operators that the player play as did not exist even though certain team mates of the player00 such as Dusty have existed in the past. One of Medal of Honor's main protagonists, pictured on the box art, is rumored to be a real veteran of the current war in Afghanistan. He is currently referred to as a ""Tier 1 Operator,"" nicknamed ""Cowboy"", and works for the National Command Authority. These operators are part of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Tier 1 operators are trained in counter terrorism and can only be deployed by the President or the Defense Secretary. The game also has players controlling Tier 2 operatives (US Army Rangers) and Tier 3 operatives (10th Mountain Division). </div>  <div> Story : The game starts as US Army Rangers are in the back of a helicopter, flying over a snowy valley. A man who seems to be the commanding officer jumps out of the helicopter first. Just when his feet brutally hit the ground, rockets fly everywhere and hit the helicopter, blacking the player out.The game flashes back 6 weeks. As the opening credits roll, the camera pans around Earth. During this sequence, the story manages to explain why the U.S. are in Afghanistan without ever using the phrase ""9/11"". Players hear news broadcasts including which say the words ""beautiful morning in NYC"", ""live from downtown New York"", ""Dark smoke coming from the Pentagon"". Players also hear the military talking about the Taliban and how they're playing planing something big, which has been referred to as the ""wedding"". The camera zooms in onto Afghanistan and gives a birds eye view of Afghanistan land through a UAV drone.The camera descends into the perspective of Rabbit, a Tier 1 soldier part of AFO Neptune. He's riding in white trucks with the three other soldiers of his squad (Mother, Voodoo, Preacher) towards the village of Gardez. They're tasked with meeting with an informant called Tariq. Tariq has told his militia friends that Neptune was coming which facilitates their entry into the town. The militia tells the squad that the Taliban have apparently left the town so there's no need to worry. Despite this fact, the squad is still on edge. They arrive on a street where the garbage cans are on fire and a truck blocks their passage. Suddenly, Chechen terrorists appear. A rocket hits the truck in front of Rabbit; Voodoo puts the truck in reverse and drives it right through a building. The two soldiers make their way by foot to meet up with the two other squad mates, Mother and Preacher who've survived despite their truck blowing up.Neptune getting it done.The squad manages to ""link up"" and deduce that Tariq has ratted them out since the Taliban was waiting for them. They still decide to fight their way to the house where the rendezvous was planned. They go to the second floor where a dead, brutally wounded man sits tied to an office chair. Neptune first think this is Tariq but realize that it is not. Suddenly they begin to hear beeping coming from inside the body and realize that the body is booby trapped. Mother kicks the chair back onto the balcony where the body blows up taking out the front of the house. Neptune radios Command asking them where Tariq is; Command replies by saying that a CIA drone may have found him in a nearby fort.Neptune arrives at the fort and discovers that it's not only heavily guarded but also inaccessible due to a huge front gate. Command sends a predator missile, making the squad experience danger close, and Neptune enters the fort, killing Taliban. They search every room of the fort for Tariq and eventually find him being held at gun point. They take care of his captors and go to a rendezvous point to hand him off to the CIA. Tariq tells the squad that they must counter attack Al Qaeda and the Taliban. According to him, the Taliban have a large contingency of soldiers and weapons in Shah-i-Kot valley. Once again, this proves that intel was wrong.AFO Neptune and a squad of local soldiers are tasked with taking an airfield in Bagram. This heavily protected airfield eventually falls and becomes a forward operating base for US forces. The base is under the control of colonel Drucker. Drucker's superior is General Flagg. Flagg is a stereotype of certain American generals while Drucker shows a much more patriotic type of America. Flagg is actually in the US with a nice office with a nice view that looks on some nice looking palm trees. Drucker on the other hand is neck deep in Afghan territory. They have very conflicting views. Drucker wants the AFO to go on recon and the Afghan army to eliminate the army, limiting American losses and letting the Afghans win their war. Flagg wants to deploy different army divisions and the Rangers to go and kill the Taliban in the mountains. Drucker proves that what the general is asking is dumb but Flagg gives Drucker 24 hours to do what he said or else.The player then takes control of AFO Wolfpack. Players control Deuce while the other team mates go by the names of Dusty, Panther and Vegas. Deuce and Dusty ride on quad bikes and spot Taliban convoys in the area. They soon discover that these convoys are actually full of weapons and go on a stealth mission to mark them all with a beacon so allied forces can take them out. The action switches back to Rabbit who paints the convoys for US missiles to destroy. At the same time, Drucker has inserted Afghan forces to go hunting for the Taliban. Flagg calls in a rage. At the same time, AFO Wolfpack approach a column of unknown vehicles. Flagg being intensely angry with Drucker orders an AC-130 strike on said vehicles. The vehicles were actually those of the Afghan army and of the US and friendly fire ensues leading the Afghans to retreat. Drucker having lost the Afghans has no other choice but to call in the Rangers.LandingThe Rangers are called in and are all super pumped. They land in a valley and first think that there is no enemy. Suddenly, they find themselves under heavy weapons fire and rockets fly through the air, shooting down US helicopters. Bodies drop but the squad manages to make it out safe. Players control Specialist Dante Adams; him and his squad are tasked in destroying the Taliban's heavy machine guns that are raining death onto the valley. Players eventually destroy the machine guns thanks to a Predator missile and traverse down towards a small village to get picked up. The village seems calm. One of the squad mates approaches a door and just when he utters the words ""cellphone"" the house blows up. The squad manages to recover, but Taliban start running down the hills in all directions. The Rangers try to take cover behind rubble but there are just too many bad guys. They call in for air support but realize that none is in the area. They also realize that they have no more ammo. The Rangers call off air support since they won't be able to survive long enough for it to arrive and wish Command ""Good Luck"". Just as they're about to be overrun, Apache helicopters appear and narrowly save the lucky Rangers.Players take control of the Apaches as they shoot up the neighboring mountains and Taliban bases. After eliminating an entire village, the Apaches are about to go home when an AAA gun suddenly appears. Right before the helicopters are blown to pieces, the Taliban manning the AAA gun is shot in the head. The shot came from Deuce and Dusty who are on the opposite mountain. They're sniping nearby Taliban and are in contact with Neptune who are on the opposite mountain. Neptune lures the Taliban into Wolfpack's line of fire, killing the insurgents. Eventually, the Taliban are too numerous and Neptune is forced to retreat over the mountain ridge.Players take control once again of Rabbit. Neptune makes a run down the mountain to escape the Taliban. They make it to the LZ but due to RPG fire it gets too hot and the Chinook leaves without Preacher and Voodoo. Mother and Rabbit promise to come back for them since their helicopter has been hit and must return to base. Mother mounts an operation and returns into the mountains at night to look for the two lost squad members. Their helicopter is attacked and Rabbit and Mother are forced to jump. They get separated but eventually meet up. However they seize the attention of the Taliban and end up being chased by them. They lock themselves up in a hut that is destroyed by an RPG. Mother drags a wounded Rabbit who manages to get up but who is combat inefficient. The two Americans get cornered at the edge of a cliff and decide to jump. They land many meters later and fall into the hands of the Taliban.CommandDrucker manages locate the two captured soldiers and wants to send a team to save them. Flagg disagrees with this and doesn't want to risk anymore losses. Flagg and Drucker get into an argument to the point where the colonel decides to disobey orders and cuts communications with Flagg. An AC-130 is in the area and the only way to know which ones are Mother and Rabbit is to send a single missile near the group of Taliban. The ones who don't run away are the two prisoners. Drucker sends in a special team to go save the two soldiers.The Chinook in which the rescue team is flying is shot down. The game shows Players what a helicopter crash looks like from inside of a helicopter, where bodies bounce around in slow motion while enemy bullets tear through its armor with ease. After this spectacular crash, the squad goes through many Taliban before finding Voodoo and Preacher. After more looking and with the help of a CIA Predator drone they find Mother and Rabbit. The player's point of view changes to Rabbit's as he tries to stay alive despite his wounds. His team mates try to reassure him but sadly there is no air support in the area to pick up Rabbit.Rabbit dies of his wounds and the rest of the team is evacuated via Chinook. Body bags line the corridor of the Chinook as jets can be seen destroying what is left of the Afghan camp. Voodoo states that ""this is not how it ends"" and the screen fades to black. A message appears, honouring the soldiers fighting to keep freedom alive. Then, ""The Catalyst"" from Linkin Park plays.The credits shortly cut to show two men dressed in typical Middle Eastern clothes enjoying a cup of tea in a bustling Middle Eastern city. Suddenly, they see a man they were looking out for, they get up and the credits resume. </div>  <div> Missions : Mission 01: First InMission 02: Breaking Bagram </div>  <div> Development : Mission 03: Running with Wolves‚Ä¶Mission 04: Dorothy‚Äôs a BitchMission 05: Belly of the BeastMission 06: GunfightersMission 07: Friends From AfarMission 08: Compromised </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mission 09: Neptune‚Äôs NetMission 10: Rescue the Rescuers </div>  <div> Weapons : The development of Medal of Honor has been split between Danger Close Games (EA Los Angeles) and DICE. Danger Close is assigned to make the single player campaign while DICE will be developing the multiplayer portion of the game. Additionally, DCG is using Unreal Engine 3 to make the single player campaign, while DICE will employ their own Frostbite Engine to create the multiplayer. This suggests the possibility of more disparity between the single player and the multiplayer portions of the game than is usually expected in a first-person shooter. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Cave exploring in the darkMedal of Honor plays like most modern day shooters. The game is played in first person with the gun being slightly on the right side of the screen. All of the weapons that the player use can be more precise when the player looks down the weapon's iron sights. Some weapons only have iron sights where the player must aim by pointing the weapon at the enemy, look down the sights and place the enemy right above the the middle vertical part of the sight. Some weapons have more precise aiming attachments such as the red dot. This dot is actual the result of a laser that's pointing out of the weapon and that indicates where the player is aiming. Some weapons, such as sniper rifles have scopes that can zoom in on a target. These scopes can also detect an enemy's heat signatures.In Medal of Honor, the player can carry around three weapons at once. He usually starts off the mission with a heavy and light weapon (for example, an assault rifle and an uzi). He also possesses a pistol. The pistol is given to him on every mission, sometimes silenced. This pistol has unlimited ammo and can be accessed by quickly hitting the weapon swap button twice. Ammo is given to the player at the beginning of a mission and he can replenish his ammo by going up to one of his squad mates and asking him for some. It's to be noted that when the player reloads, if a bullet is already in the chamber before reloading, it stays in the chamber, providing one extra bullet to shoot per magazine. The player will also encounter special weapons during certain events. For example, he may be asked to use a large sniper rifle for long range shots. During this sequence, the player must take the wind and distance into account. At other times, the player may have to use a Soflam to guide missiles to the desired target.Medal of Honor offers some player movement that isn't regularly seen in modern day shooters. Players can lean from left to right by holding down the lean button (L1 on PS3, LB on 360, Q and E on PC). Players have unlimited sprint. Players can also slide. Slide is done while sprinting. While sprinting, hit the crouch/prone button and the character will slide a short distance. This is useful for getting into cover. Players can crouch and lay prone; players will crawl if they move while prone. The player can keep tabs on how much ammo he has left, what weapons he has equipped, where his squad mates are and where his objective is by hitting up on the control pad. Players can also choose the ammo type with the control pad. Players can choose to change the weapon from auto to semi-auto.Apache GunshipOne level has the player driving an ATV. The ATV is driven like any other vehicle. It can accelerate, brake and reverse. It can also power slide and the player can turn the head lights off for stealth. In one mission, the player is firing Hellfire missiles and heavy machine gun rounds from an Apache helicopter. The Hellfire missiles can only be fired at enemies in front of the player, the heavy machine gun can fire in almost every direction except directly behind the Apache.  </div>  <div> Multiplayer Beta : Weapons included in the single-player and multiplayer games:Assault Rifles: AK-47, M16A4,Carbines: M4A1, AKS-74USub-Machine Guns: MP7A1 , P90TRShotguns: TOZ-194, 870MCSSniper Rifles: M21, M24, SVD, SV-98 , M-110, M82Machine Guns: M249, PKM , MK43(M60E4 with RAS)Pistols: Beretta M9 , SIG-Sauer P226, MP-443 </div>  <div> Limited Edition : Firing at enemies in multiplayerMultiplayer was built entirely by DICE and is separate from the single player campaign. It's interesting to know that when the game is booted up, the single player portion automatically loads. If players select multiplayer from the menu, the game goes to a separate load screen to load the mode.Multiplayer is similar to other multiplayer modes in modern shooters. It's class-based, has killstreaks, and uses experience points for persistent progression. Unlike other EA online games, Medal of Honor does not require an online pass to access the multiplayer component. This was probably done to keep it competitive with Activision's Call of Duty series. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The gameplay for this mode is different from the single player. The controls have changed and certain actions that were present in the single player are absent from the multiplayer. For example, in multiplayer, players cannot slide, lean or go prone. Also, only two weapons are available at a time. The controls are very similar to what can be found in DICE's last multiplayer focused game Battlefield: Bad Company 2.The multiplayer also has a different HUD: the ammo is marked differently and multiplayer adds a minimap. This minimap shows the location of squad mates and enemy locations when they fire their weapon or the UAV is online. The score of the current game is also displayed on the bottom left as well as killstreak progress, which starts at 0/50. </div>  <div> Taliban Controversy : The multiplayer offers the choice of 3 classes to the player: Rifleman, Special Ops and Sniper. By choosing a class and earning points in the game, either by killing enemies, accomplishing objectives or using support actions, the player earns points specific to the class he's playing as. The player can play as one of two teams: Coalition or Opposing Forces (ex Taliban). Both teams use different weapons, weapons that can be unlocked by gaining levels (the game caps at level 15). Here is the full unlock tree for each class: </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : Recruit: Assault Rifle (M16A4 or AK-47)Regular: Extra MagazineExpert: Red Dot Scope (increases accuracy)Veteran: Light Machine Gun (M249 or Kalashnikov PKM)Operator: Suppressor (silences weapon but decreases range)Commander: Open-Tip Ammunition (increases damage)Elite: Long Range Combat Scope (increases range)Tier 1 Recruit: Muzzle Brake (increases accuracy)Tier 1 Regular: F2000 Assault RifleTier 1 Expert: Veteran Assault Rifle (call sign)Tier 1 Veteran: Veteran Light Machine Gun (call sign)Tier 1 Operator: Enemy Assault RifleTier 1 Commander: Pistol AmmoTier 1 Elite: Enemy Light Machine GunTier 1 Warfighter: Extra Grenade </div> "

The only official installment of the series for 32-bit consoles, Mega Man 8 introduces a brand new art style (the second complete change in the series) and cutscenes detailed in animated full-motion video. The game commemorates the 10th anniversary of the series and is the last titled game in the franchise for 11 years (before Mega Man 9).Set in the year 20XX, the game takes place shortly after the events of Mega Man 7 (in which the humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeats both the evil roboticist Dr. Wily, for the seventh time, and new-found rival Bass). Two mysterious forces battle in outer space before crash-landing down to Earth, causing Mega Man (who was battling Bass at the time) to investigate. When he reaches the crater, he sees Dr. Wily (flying away with a mysterious purple orb) and a mysterious damaged robot to send back to Dr. Light for repair. When Dr. Wily sends a new group of Robot Masters to combat Mega Man, our hero must battle Dr. Wily's forces while investigating the connection between the purple orbs and the damaged robot.Because the PlayStation version was rushed to be released a month before the Sega Saturn version, the Sega Saturn version received some bonus additions, most notably access to special material (such as official artwork and sound test mode) and two new mini-boss battles (Cut Man from the original Mega Man and Wood Man from Mega Man 2).The PlayStation version of the game was later released (in North America only) as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube on June 23, 2004 and the Xbox on March 15, 2005. An unofficial 8-bit ""demake"" of Mega Man 8 was finished in 2010, coinciding with the release of the deliberately-retro Mega Man 10. More information can be found here.Shortly after the game was released, Capcom began porting the game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with the intent of selling it to those who have not purchased one of the two 32-bit consoles. Not wanting to make a half-hearted attempt, they ended up making an original Mega Man game (exclusively for Japan in its original run) using most of the assets from Mega Man 8 (including two of the game's bosses, Tengu Man and Astro Man), titled Rockman & Forte. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay is similar to the previous games, but with some additions. The main priority is the player picks a level and fights the end boss; Mega Man will earn a weapon for defeating the boss. Rush also returns with some special abilities. Also returning from Mega Man 7 is the item store.Like Mega Man 7, only four robot masters are available at the start. After the player beats the first four, the other four will appear. The weapons earned from the first four robot masters play a big role in the other four levels; for example, in Search Man's stage, the thunder claw that was earned from Clown Man, is used to get through spiked gaps by using the thunder claw to grab on to metal poles and swing to the other side.Rush returns in Mega Man 8, this time with new abilities. Old abilities like Rush Marine and Rush Coil have been retired, but new abilities are introduced. Each new ability can be earned by defeating the mid bosses in some of the game's levels. The first new ability is Rush can transform into a motorcycle - Mega Man can hop on, shoot projectiles, and run at high speed. The other is Rush will drop a random item for Mega Man, which can be a health item or ammunition for Mega Man's weapon. Rush can also fly up in the air and drop health or ammunition items for Mega Man. The last new ability is Rush can fly up in the air and aid Mega Man in battle by dropping missiles on enemies.The item store.Also returning from Mega Man 7 is the item store. Items that were available in Mega Man 7 were purchased by collecting bolts that were dropped by enemies.

He is searching for a Refractor to power his ship/home called ""The Flutter"". After Mega Man finds the Refractor and attempts to leave he runs into the Hanmurudoll, the guardian of the unknown ruin. Mega Man quickly deals with this obstacle and continues on his way to escape with the refractor. He leaves the ruin and meets up in the flutter with Roll, Barrel Casket (Mega Man‚Äôs spotter and Rolls Grandfather) and Data, a mysterious monkey, which only Mega Man can understand. However during flight, the flutter experiences turbulence, which causes them to crash land on the island, called Kattelox. Mega Man is now charged with the task of repairing the flutter so the Casket family can return to sailing the skies searching for more treasures.Once Mega Man leaves the Flutter a police car comes screeching to Mega Man's location in order to investigate the crash. Barrel decides to go with the officer in order to answer any questions he needs to clear things up. He asks Mega Man to check out the town and see what it has to offer.After Mega Man is through looking through the town and the local ruins Roll asks Mega Man to go looking for Gramps. He goes downtown and into the Town Hall and after talking to a few guards is allowed into the Mayors office where he is greeted by Gramps. He introduces Mega Man to Amelia, the mayor of Kattleox. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mega Man, roaming around the forest area.Mega Man Legends is a 3rd person, Action-RPG which takes place in a free-roaming world. The player explores 'digs' sites in which Mega Man just venture into Ruins to find parts that will help restore his ship and get them off the crashed island. Upon exploring these ruins the player will come across many different items that help power-up Mega Man in different ways. The main thing the player will come across will be ""Zenny"", which the currency used in the Mega Man franchise, as well as many other games with Japanese origins. Zenny comes in the form of crystals that are dropped when enemies are defeated and certain objects are destroyed. Zenny can be used in the towns market to buy items like Health upgrades, buster parts and other power-ups. </div>  <div> Facts about the Game : Mega Man has a fully customizable Bustergun and Secondary weapons. The Bustergun can be upgraded in terms of Range, Power, Energy and Rapid through the use of ""Buster parts"", which are bought from the Market and found in ruins and side missions.Range- distance from Mega Man the shots will travel.Power- overall attack value afflicted on enemies. The shots develop from small orange pellets to large blue ones.Energy- the number of successive shots the buster gun can shoot. Start from three and stops in a never-ending stream.Rapid- the speed at which the shots travel.Roll can provide backup using the ‚ÄòSupport Van‚Äô, which she found and restored outside town. She gives Mega Man a walkie-talkie that he can use in any part of the town to take him elsewhere. While inside, Mega Man can save by talking and get healed from Data. Roll can use the van to provide Mega Man with information on his next objective, as well as Upgrade and change secondary weapons.And Mega Man also has a number of these secondary weapons at his disposal. Parts procured around town and through missions and stores can be taken to Roll to create powerful and varied weapons from Trip Mines to Laser Beams and are effective in a number of different situations. Secondary weapons can be upgraded but cost Roll Zenny to make. While these upgrades change from weapon to weapon, they usually lead to increased attack power and energy. Mega Man can only have 1 secondary weapon equipped, and can only switch them up in the support van.Mega Man can upgrade his gear by finding a helmet, buying new Armors for increasing protection and building shoes that allow Mega Man to jump higher or skate about town. </div> "

Mega Man X4,Capcom,CapcomVirgin Interactive,"July 15, 1997",ps,Mega Man X4 was the first in the series created specifically for Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation. Zero also debuts as a full-fledged playable character with his own gameplay style.,3030-20256,20256,0,1997-07-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/mega-man-x4/3030-20256/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Mega Man X4 (known in Japan as Rockman X4) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation on September 1997 in the US.The fourth game in the Mega Man X series (and the sequel to Mega Man X3), the game is the first to be built for 32-bit consoles (allowing them to use a new higher-quality art style, higher-quality audio, and a game saving system). Mega Man X4 also features animated full-motion video cutscenes and separate campaigns for both Mega Man X and Zero (who now has a different close-ranged combat style with his Z-Sword).Set in 21XX, shortly after the events of Mega Man X3, a new Reploid anti-Maverick military force has risen (the ""Repliforce"") led by the powerful Reploid, General (and his second-in-command, Colonel). When massive floating city Sky Lagoon crashes down to Earth (killing millions of civilians) and Repliforce is believed to be behind it (soon regarded as a force of Mavericks), X (teamed up with rookie Maverick Hunter Double) and Zero (teamed up with Colonel's kind-hearted sister, Iris) must investigate the Repliforce's plan to build a utopian space station (believing it to be used for a more sinister purpose).The game was later released for the PC in Japan (on December 3, 1998) and North America (sometime in 1999) and is included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (released on January 10, 2006). </div>  <div> Gameplay : ""Get Ready!""The gameplay for X is similar to the previous games in the series; X has his X-buster that can be charged up to shoot out a powerful projectile, he can climb on walls, and has a dash move. When bosses are defeated, X can inherit their powers in the form of a weapon with limited ammunition. X also has armor upgrades - Helmet, legs, body armor, and X-Buster - that are found in four of the eight levels; they can upgrade X's power for the X-buster, and others can give him special abilities that he never had.Zero is similar to X in terms of basic mechanics (Dash and climb), but differs greatly in terms of combat. Zero is more up close melee style, he also has no projectile attacks (With the exception one that is earned by Storm Owl). Zero has no armor upgrades - it's partly due to the fact the armor upgrades are not compatible to Zero (It was explained in Mega Man X5). When a boss is defeated, Zero learns a new technique instead of a new weapon - he also has no limit to how many times he could use his newly learned techniques.Other upgrades can be found in each of the stages. Such as heart containers, that can increase the health bar; and energy capsules that's use to store extra health. In the previous games, the player can hold up to four energy capsules, but in Mega Man X4, only two are found for the health bar and a third one is use to refill a weapon's ammo. </div>  <div> Stages : The Fourth Armor.Helmet: The helmet upgrade allows infinite energy for all of X's weapons.Legs: The leg upgrade allows X to hover in the air for a short amount of time.Body Armor: The armor upgrade gives X a new ability known as Nova Strike - it's a powerful air-dash move. The way the Nova Strike is done is by filling up a meter by taking enough damage - it's similar to the G-Crush armor from Mega Man X2.X-Buster: For the first time in the X series, Mega Man X4 allows the player to give a choice of two X-Buster upgrades. One of them lets X charge up his X-Buster up to four times. The other version gives the X-Buster a fourth level when charged up. </div>  <div> Bosses : The most well drawn level in the game, the jungle level has X or Zero going through streaming water while battling javelin wielding mavericks that can shoot spears from their backs in eight different directions. Other areas contains large gaps with a waterfall raining down in between with falling logs that are used as platforms for X or Zero to get through. Mechanical bee hives are also present - they can generate robotic killer bees. Robotic snakes are also found - they can sneak up on X or Zero while crossing through trees. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A snowy level that's filled with mechanical polar bears that have the ability throw out sharp ice blocks. Other sections have X or Zero going through spiked floors with sliding platforms that will disintegrate in a short period of time; on the platforms, are mavericks with skiing gear on. The other section of the stage is filled with frozen blocks that have bombs or the little helmet mavericks frozen inside. And the last sections of the stage has a bird that can change the scenery by freezing everything. </div> "

Both protagonists Mega Man X and Zero have new and improved abilities (such as multiple armors for X) and can now be switched out between levels (rather than separate them into different campaigns).Set in 21XX, the game takes place several months after the events of Mega Man X4 (where Maverick Hunters Mega Man X and Zero ended Maverick Sigma's plan to manipulate an anti-Maverick Reploid military force to destroy all human life on Earth). A revived Sigma spreads a virus around the world that turns Reploids into berserk Mavericks. To make matters worse, a mysterious mercenary named Dynamo has scattered another virus in remote space colony Eurasia and sends it on a collision course towards Earth. In a race against time, it's up to X and Zero (along with their new leader Signas, their new operator Alia, and skilled mechanic Douglas) to gather parts (guarded by infected Reploids) in order to upgrade the powerful Enigma particle cannon to prevent global destruction.The game was later released for the PC in Japan (on May 24, 2002) and North America (on August 20, 2002) and is included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (released on January 10, 2006). </div>  <div> Gameplay : As with X4, you begin the game with a choice of who you want to play as. Picking X or Zero to play the opening Eurasia stage can change the ending of the game, so choose wisely. Unlike X4, however, after you finish the opening tutorial stage, you can go into the Maverick stages with either X or Zero, so you aren't making such a difficult choice at the beginning. Each stage has multiple obstacles that are exclusive to that stage, and usually have more than one section to them. </div>  <div> Weapons : Parts are obtained from various Reploids that you save as well as from enemies you kill. These parts will enhance X or Zero's performance, and while some are exclusive to either X or Zero, most of them can be shared between the two. </div>  <div> Mavericks : One of the new mechanics to this game is the ability to save injured Reploids that are trapped in each of the 8 Maverick stages. There are many benefits to rescuing them, such as restoring your lost energy, getting extra lives, and even getting some sweet parts. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Another new addition to this game is the freedom in how you want to play through it. The only stages you are required to play are the opening Eurasia stage, and the four Sigma stages. That's right, you can skip right past the Maverick levels, although the last levels will be significantly harder without any parts, armors, or extra weapons obtained from those levels. </div> "

A new and mysterious virus, known as ""Nightmare"", is turning Reploids into crazed Mavericks. When Reploid scientist Isoc (along with his subordinate, High Max) identify the cause as the ""ghost"" of Zero, X (now brandishing Zero's Z-Saber) must investigate the Nightmare phenomenon (while encountering infected researchers of the virus, who were created by lead researcher Gate) and stop Zero's Nightmare doppelganger.The game was later released for the PC in different parts of Asia sometime in 2002-2003 and is included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (released on January 10, 2006). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game starts off with X, but Zero can be unlocked later. The game features a ""Nightmare"" system, which makes it so that when X or Zero defeats a Maverick, their icon on the level select screen will become red, which means that certain environmental hazards will be added to the level to increase difficulty. This is important because this game has many more hidden secrets to find than the other games in the X series. </div>  <div> Ranking System : Mega Man X6 offers a leveling system, and the way a character can level up is by obtaining souls from certain Mavericks. Once the player collects enough, the character's ranking will go up, which allows the characters to have access others special parts that are obtained from missing Reploids, found in various locations throughout the game's eight Maverick stages. </div>  <div> Reploids/Parts : The game has over a hundreds missing reploids in the game's levels - some of the Reploids offer specials parts that X or Zero can use. The special parts can help X & Zero in certain ways. For example, one of the parts can allow X or Zero jump higher, or some can increase the power of the X-Buster or the Z Saber. </div>  <div> Armors : X has a total of four armors in the game, and each armor has certain abilities.The Falcon Armor.Falcon Armor: Available from the start of game, the Falcon Armor gives X the ability to perform a dash in mid-air that will also damage enemies, perform the Giga Attack that damages all enemies on screen, and use special charged versions of the weapons obtained by the Maverick bosses.The Shadow Armor.Shadow Armor: The Shadow Armor has the ability to touch spiked areas with no consequence, take less damage, dash vertically by pressing up and jump, shoot Shurikens that shoot in random directions, and perform a special charged slash with the Z Saber. The one downside to this armor is that it prevents air dashing and weapons obtained from defeated Mavericks.The Blade Armor.Blade Armor: The Blade Armor has the ability to perform a powerful slash attack by pressing up and the attack button with a full weapon charge, and the ability to dash in any direction and stop in mid-air. While dashing, X will be invincible to all attacks.Ultimate Armor.Ultimate Armor: Only accessible via a cheat code entered at the title screen, this incredibly powerful armor has the ability to use a special move called Nova Strike at any time, which rockets X forward and does a great deal to normal enemies and bosses. It also has a conventional air dash and the same charged shot received with the Ultimate Armor in X4 and X5. </div>  <div> Bosses : Name: Blizzard WolfangLevel: NorthPole AreaWeapon: Ice Burst (X) Hydroga (Zero)Weakness: Magma Blade (X) Shoenzan (Zero)Name: Commander YammackLevel: Amazon AreaWeapon: Yammar OptionWeakness: Ray ArrowName: Infinity MijinionLevel: Weapon CenterWeapon: Ray ArrowWeakness: Guard ShellName: Ground ScaravichLevel: Central MuseumWeapon: Ground Dash (X) Sentsuizan (Zero)Weakness: Yammar OptionName: Rainy TurtloidLevel: Inami TempleWeapon: Meteor Rain (X) Ensuizan (Zero)Weakness: Ice Burst (X) Hydroga (Zero)Name: Metal Shark PlayerLevel: Recycle LabWeapon: Metal Anchor (X) Rakukojini (Zero)Weakness: Meteor Rain (X) Ensuizan (Zero)Name: Blaze HeatnixLevel: Magma AreaWeapon: Magma Blade (X) Shoenzan (Zero)Weakness: Ground Dash (X) Sentsuizan (Zero)Name: Shield SheldonLevel: Laser InstituteWeapon: Guard ShellWeakness: Metal Anchor (X) Rakukojini (Zero) </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Cover ArtIn 2005 Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6.

Loath is demanding that the Bonne family pay him the 1,000,000 Zenny loan that they owe him or else Tiesel and Bon will never be seen again. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Searching for Zenny in Free Mode.The gameplay revolves around Tron undertaking many mini-game type missions in order to raise funds in order to pay back the debt. Some of these mini-games include missions such as:Robbing banks and dealing with an overly ambitious rookie cop named Denise MarmaladeA ""free mode"" where you explore a large, tiered ruin, that can only be explored as you unlock various weapons and itemsArranging and collecting crates at a dock to collect ZennyExcavating mines with the help of servbots and other fellow diggers to find the Aurora StonesA central theme of the game is Tron Bonne's relationship with all of her servbots. In addition to upgrading them individually, Tron can also pick one as her favorite. During missions Tron uses a beacon to give the servbots instructions. This is usually either to raid a location for zenny and items, or distract an enemy.A lot of the graphics and overall feel is borrowed from Mega Man Legends.

The game features combat in mechs, known as MCAs (Mobile Combat Armor) in the Shogo universe, as well as more conventional on-foot shooting with standard FPS weapons such as assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, etc. At the beginning of the game, the player may choose one of four available MCAs to pilot. Each MCA has different statistics and speed, but all can all use the same weapons. Each level in the game takes place either entirely on-foot or entirely in an MCA, as the player cannot get in or out of MCAs during gameplay.Shogo was also one of the first standard FPS games to feature a branching storyline, in which the player can choose sides and take a different path through the story. The branching point occurs about 80% of the way into the game. One path (siding with Gabriel) results in more on-foot action and the other (siding with the UCA) is more MCA-oriented. The two paths also feature completely different missions and different endings.On April, 14th 2017 the game was re-released on the digital store front Steam. </div>  <div> Story : Players control Sanjuro Makabe, an MCA pilot working for the UCA (United Corporate Authority) under Commander Nathaniel Akkaraju of the UCASF flagship Leviathan. The UCA main mission is to fight against a terrorist organization known as the Fallen. The action takes place in different locations around the planet Cronus. Both the UCA and the Fallen seek to control a rare energy source called Kato, only found on Cronus. Prior to the start of the game Sanjuro had lost his brother Toshiro, his childhood friend Baku, and the woman he loved, Kura Akkaraju, to a massive earthquake that struck while they were on a mission to assassinate the former leader of the Fallen, Ivan Isarevich. When the game begins, Sanjuro is dating Kathryn, Kura's sister. Sanjuro seeks to avenge his fallen comrades in the war on Cronus.On Cronus, Sanjuro fights his way through the city of Avernus to the place where his friends and brother were killed. Along the way he meets Hank Johnson, a local survivor who helps him out after he loses contact with Kathryn. Soon after, Sanjuro crosses paths with Ryo Ishikawa, the leader of an enigmatic third faction called Shogo. Ryo explains that Sanjuro's friends weren't actually killed in that fateful battle long ago. In fact, Baku had joined Shogo under the alias of Uziel, Toshiro had joined the Fallen, and Kura had rejoined the UCA where she was working deep undercover, which necessitated that Sanjuro not be informed of her survival.Sanjuro sets off to meet up with Kura, but before he can reach her, she gets captured by local security. Sanjuro rescues her with Ryo's assistance, but Hank is killed in cold blood by Ryo, right before Sanjuro's eyes. Kura tells Sanjuro that his brother, Toshiro, has not joined the Fallen by choice, but rather has been mind-controlled by an ancient alien creature called Cothineal that is using the Fallen to do its bidding. Under the Cothineal's influence, Toshiro has become Gabriel, leader of the Fallen. Admiral Akkaraju won't hear of this, however, and in defiance of the UCA high command, he begins preparing to fire the Leviathan's Kato cannon at Avernus to exterminate the Fallen once and for all, collateral damage be damned.At this point, Sanjuro must make a choice: either join the Fallen and turn against the UCA to stop the Admiral from firing the Kato cannon at Avernus, or stay loyal to the UCA and fight his puppet brother to destroy the Fallen. Either way, Sanjuro encounters Ryo along the way, who is playing all sides and working with whomever Sanjuro turns against, providing Sanjuro the opportunity to kill Ryo, which he does.If Sanjuro sides with the UCA, he travels back through Avernus to find and attack the Fallen's hidden fortress. There, he encounters his childhood friend Baku and kills him in UCA combat. He then finds Gabriel protected by feeding off the energy of Cothineal. Sanjuro shoots Cothineal enough to weaken him, exposing Gabriel long enough to kill Gabriel, and thus freeing Toshiro who is psychologically traumatized. With the Fallen defeated, the Admiral backs down from firing the Kato cannon. The Admiral's daughters, Kathryn and Kura, flirt with Sanjuro. The end.If Sanjuro sides with Gabriel and the Fallen, he attacks and infiltrates the Leviathan, sabotages the ship's systems, guns his way through the crew, and finally finds the Admiral, who initiates the Kato cannon firing sequence. Sanjuro halts the firing sequence just in the nick of time, stopping the Admiral, who is arrested and court marshaled. The Admiral's daughters, Kathryn and Kura, flirt with Sanjuro. The end. </div>  <div> Development : In a 2001 Gamasutra post-mortem of No One Lives Forever, Craig Hubbard, the creative director on Shogo, described Shogo as a game that ""fell embarrassingly short of our original design goals"". Furthermore, he said, ""the only thing that saved Shogo from complete disaster was the realization, some six months before we were supposed to ship, that there was no way to make the game great in that amount of time. So, we concentrated on making it fun.... The intended scope of the project was so grand, particularly for such a tiny team, that we were overwhelmed just trying to get everything into the game. As a result, we didn't have time to polish any of it. The final product is barely more than a prototype of the game we were trying to make, even after we cut characters, settings, story elements, and whatever else we could jettison without breaking the game.... I'm certainly proud of Shogo as an accomplishment, but as a game it is a grim reminder of the perils of wild optimism and unchecked ambition."" </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The multiplayer mode lets players choose between infantry maps and MCA maps. Scattered around the maps are health pickups, armor pickups, power ups, and weapons. All the weapons from the single player mode are available in multiplayer. Players can also choose one of the four MCAs for multiplayer. Multiplayer continues to have fanbase and fan made updates for the game have been release which address balance and cheating. </div>  <div> Mods : There are several mods for Shogo, although most of them are incomplete. There were promising mods such as Greased With Lovin', which attempted to improve the game experience overall with better balancing, A.I. and etc. There are also many of custom maps for Shogo available on the web. An editor as well as the original Shogo source code have been released and are available for download. </div>  <div> Planned Expansions and Sequel : Supposedly a screenshot of ShugotenshiAn expansion called Shugotenshi was planned. The expansion would have allowed the player to play as Kura, seeing the story from her perspective. It appears that the expansion was quite far along in development, but was never completed. The title roughly translates to ""guardian angel"", which would have referred to Kura's role as Sanjuro's secret protector. Some speculate that the expansion was cancelled because the original game did not sell well. The reason for poor sales may have been Shogo's release just a month before Half-Life.Another expansion was called Legacy of the Fallen and would have five new MCAs, six new infantry weapons and five new MCA weapons and would take place on a kato mining facility at Iota-33. There would be a new story explaining the Fallen and their structure and have a cast of new characters. Also, the level-structure would have been more like Half-Life, where players enter and exit levels seamlessly, with just a ""Loading"" text on screen.Another screenshot of ShugotenshiShogo 2 or a sort of expansion pack was planned and was supposed to use a new graphics engine, there are very few pictures of this but there are some tech demo screens and very little is known about this game. During the end of Shogo it says ""Expect more games in the Shogo saga!"" so this was probably the true sequel in works. Monolith have not announced Shogo 2 or any other Shogo games since then, however, during a demonstration of F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, they said that they had wanted to do destructible environments in Shogo, and that they were able to do that now in Project Origin with their mech unit, so this combined with all the trivia for Shogo in F.E.A.R. shows they haven't forgotten about Shogo. </div>  <div> Additional Information : Old Shogo 2 tech screenMonolith's pirate-themed 2D-platformer Claw (released in 1997) is referenced in this game. The main character of the game, Captain Nathaniel Joseph Claw, is represented as a doll that the player can collect as part of a side mission in Shogo. His first name, Nathaniel, is also shared with Admiral Nathaniel Akkaraju in Shogo. </div> "

It also updates the control scheme (by adding a sixth ""Run"" button) while adding selectable difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos, mid-fight stage transitions, the ""Mercy"" system, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special multiplayer pre-match codes known as ""Kombat Kodes"".Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's ""cyber-assassin"" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.The game later received a major revision in November 1995, known as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, that added new characters (including the return of masked human ninjas), new game modes (including 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), new backgrounds, and updated character movelists. It was further updated on with the console-exclusive game Mortal Kombat Trilogy a year later.Along with 16-bit console conversions (by Sculptured Software) for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and handheld conversions (by Software Creations) for the Game Boy and Game Gear (the latter exclusively in Europe), the original game also received a port by Williams to the 32-bit Sony PlayStation shortly after that console's North American release. The game also received two versions for PCs: a MS-DOS version by Sculptured Software and a Windows version by Williams (the latter being a port of the PS1 version). All of the original ports were released by Williams (with the European version co-released by Acclaim). The game was also included two compilations: the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, and the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures: Deluxe Edition for the PC. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  Mortal Kombat ""X"" Control Panel with the new run buttonThe gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a ""Run Meter"", which limits the use of running.Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a ""chain combo"" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny!The game also introduces the concept of ""Choose Your Destiny"", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different ""towers"", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a ""Kombat Kode"") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an ""Ultimate Kombat Kode""). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working ""Ultimate Kombat Kode"" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character. </div>  <div> Characters : ANIMALITY! Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II). </div>  <div> Arenas :  The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)The original arcade release included 15 playable characters (one of which must be unlocked beforehand), two unplayable boss characters, and one unplayable hidden opponent for a total of 18 combatants.Along with final boss Shao Kahn, eight characters return from previous games in the series.

Mortal Kombat 4,Eurocom,Midway,"June 24, 1998",ps,"Mortal Kombat 4 is the fourth installment of one of the most violent fighting game franchises of all time, moving the series to 3D while introducing limited weapon-based combat.",3030-6421,6421,0,1997-10-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-4/3030-6421/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Sub-Zero with his Freeze Wand.Mortal Kombat 4 is a 3D fighting game developed and released by Midway on October 1997 for arcades. The game makes a significant shift to 3D while introducing weapon-based combat to the franchise. The setting reverts from the gritty, Western look of Mortal Kombat 3 to mythical, Eastern look of the first two Mortal Kombat games.The game has three revisions within a year, fixing various bugs and adding new secrets, bugfixes and features. The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in late June 1998, the PC in late July 1998, and was a launch title for the Sega Dreamcast under the name Mortal Kombat Gold. These home versions added exclusive content, including new characters and FMV intros, biographies, and endings. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Color in 1998 by Digital Eclipse.Taking place after the events of Mortal Kombat 3, the plot of Mortal Kombat 4 revolves around the war between the God of Thunder Raiden (along with the warriors of Earthrealm) and the fallen Elder God Shinnok (along with the evil sorceror Quan Chi and their army of darkness). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Despite the transition to 3D, the game plays very similarly to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Players have four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick), a Block button, and a Run button. Players have a Run Meter to prevent them from abusing the Run button, which gives them a quick dash forward for offensive manuevers. Players can now sidestep left and right (by tapping the Run button twice), allowing them to dodge projectiles and move the camera so that other players can not pick up items on the ground as easily.The ""chain combo"" system is still intact, where players use strings of normal attacks to perform a pre-programmed combo. However, Mortal Kombat 4 has added a ""Maximum Damage"" cap, automatically breaking off combos (in a similar vein to Killer Instinct's "" Combo Breaker"").One main concept introduced to the Mortal Kombat franchise in Mortal Kombat 4 is weapon-based combat. Players perform a specific button and joystick combination and the character would equip a weapon (usually a sword, an axe, or a club). The weapon deals more damage and changes certain attacks (Fujin's Crossbow, for example, can fire bolts). The weapon is knocked out of the player's hand on the first attack landed by an opponent, in which that weapon can be picked up by either player by pressing down on the joystick and the Run button. Some stages have objects (such as rocks in Goro's Lair) scattered around that can also be picked up and thrown at opponents.Some mechanics from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 were scrapped, including Friendships, Babalities, Animalities, the ability to show "" Mercy"", eight-player tournament mode, and mid-match stage transitions. There are no Endurance Matches, instead bringing back 2-on-2 mode.This is the first Mortal Kombat game to not include palette swaps, as each character is visually unique. This also marks the first game to include the ability to select an alternate costume (by holding the Start button while selecting a character). </div>  <div> Characters : The fifteen playable fighters from the Arcade version.Mortal Kombat 4 included 15 playable characters in the original Arcade release, 7 of which are new additions to the series. It is the first main entry in the series where both boss characters are playable.With the exception of the handheld Game Boy Color version, all Home versions of the game added additional characters, all of which from previous Mortal Kombat games. This brings the grand total to 17 in the N64 and PS1 versions and 23 in the DC version.In addition, later Arcade and Home console releases included a secret easter egg that changes the player character's model to a bloody skeleton that was used in certain Fatalities (sometimes dubbed ""Meat""). A new original character was made based on this appearance in later Mortal Kombat games. </div>  <div> Arenas : Fujin - One of the last remaining Gods in Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, Fujin is the God of Wind and an ally of Raiden.Jarek (not available in the GBC version) - Believed to be the last remaining member of Kano's criminal organization, the Black Dragon, Jarek is a ruthless criminal who reluctantly assists Sonya and the other Earth warriors in defeating Shinnok's forces.Kai (not available in the GBC version) - A skilled African-American martial artist who trained under the White Lotus Society with Liu Kang before learning from great masters throughout Asia.Reiko - A former general of Shinnok's army who, after believed to be killed during Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, resurfaces to fight the forces of Earth hand-to-hand.Tanya - The daughter of an Edenian ambassador, Tanya unknowingly let Shinnok invade Edenia for his base of operations. While she appears to assist Earth's forces, her true motives are unclear.Quan Chi (sub-boss) - A dark sorceror who uses his abilities to free Shinnok from his imprisonment in exchange for being his second-in-command.Shinnok (final boss, unplayable in the GBC version) - A fallen Elder God free from his banishment to the Netherrealm, waging a war against the Elder Gods (particularly Raiden).

It was later ported by Avalanche to the  Nintendo 64 on December 8, 1997.The first spin-off title in the  Mortal Kombat fighting game series, Mythologies focuses on a narrow group of primary characters while serving as a prologue to the original  Mortal Kombat (similar to  Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released three years later). The game blends fighting game mechanics of  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 with a beat-em-up platformer, adding some elements of RPGs (such as an inventory system and experience points for learning new special moves). It is also the last Mortal Kombat game to feature  digitized characters and the only game in the series to have  live-action cutscenes.In the game, players take the role of the  original Sub-Zero (a ninja of the  Lin Kuei clan with the mastery of  frost-based attacks) who, after infiltrating the  Shaolin Temple to steal the Sacred  Map of Elements (defeating rival  Scorpion in the process), is sent by the mysterious sorceror  Quan Chi to retrieve a mysterious  amulet located in the Temple of Elements. It is revealed afterwards, however, that the sorceror is using this amulet to resurrect the dark fallen Elder God  Shinnok. After being confronted by  Raiden, god of thunder, the player must travel to the  Netherrealm, searching for the whereabouts of Quan Chi while fighting his three assassins (Kia, Jataaka, and  Sareena). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like Mortal Kombat 3, Mythologies consisted of 4 attack buttons, a block button, and a run button. The game also used a ""turn"" button to deal with attackers on either side of Sub-Zero, accompanied by an ‚Äúaction‚Äù button used for items. The gameplay took place on a 2D plane that consisted of a fighting system very similar to that of the Mortal Kombat fighting series. The ""turn"" button would alleviate the issue of Sub-Zero turning away from an opponent while performing a special move. Platforming was also part of the 2D scrolling gameplay. Sub-Zero‚Äôs special abilities extinguished an ‚ÄúIce Meter‚Äù that was replenished by retrieving items.Sub-Zero does not start the game with all his special abilities. The aforementioned ""Ice Meter"" does not appear until Sub-Zero learns abilities that use it. The system is very RPG-like in nature as it tracks experience points, ability upgrades, and inventory. </div> "

While primarily a 3D beat-em-up, the game used many mechanics made commonplace in other game genres at the time, such as the  experience point and item system of RPGs and a restrictive  first-person shooter mechanic.The game puts players in the role of U.S. Army Special Forces Major  Jackson ""Jax"" Briggs as he hunts down  Kano, the leader of the infamous Black Dragon gang. With help from his base operative (codenamed ""Gemini""), Jax encounters other members of the gang freed by Kano from a maximum security prison (including his second-in-command Jarek, pyromaniac  No Face, expert swordswoman  Tasia, and hulkish ninja  Tremor).The game was infamous for its stagnant development cycle, which was made complicated by the departure of most of the staff (including series co-creator John Tobias).

Once the bar fills up for a player, their character moves faster and deals more damage for a short period of time before the bar resets.The Nintendo 64 version includes a new exclusive game mode, 3-on-3 Kombat, which plays exactly like 2-on-2 Kombat (only with three fighters each instead of two).

Motor Toon Grand Prix 2,Polyphony Digital,Sony Computer Entertainment,"October 15, 1996",ps,,3030-4911,4911,0,1996-10-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/motor-toon-grand-prix/3030-4911/,ESRB: E," <div> History : The chronological order of this franchise can be somewhat confusing, as the game that was released as Motor Toon Grand Prix in the west, was actually the second game in the series. Motor Toon Grand Prix 2 was realeased simply as Motor Toon Grand Prix in the western markets as the first installment never left Japan. Developed by                         Polyphony Digital in 1996, the game was designed by          Kazunori Yamauchi, who later went on to creating the critically acclaimed                        Gran Turismo series. In 2002, Motor Toon Grand Prix (2) was re-released in Europe as a dual game pack alongside the first                          Gran Turismo game. ¬†¬† </div>  <div> Overview : Motor Toon Grand Prix is a cartoon style racing game, with characters and vehicles representing mostly stereotypical comic book and video game archetypes. The game, both in visual style and gameplay-wise, clearly draws a lot of inspiration  from cart racing classics like the popular                      Mario Kart series from                       Nintendo. The most significant visual characteristic separating this game from others is its exaggerated use of squash and stretch in the animation of the vehicles, giving an almost jelly-like behavior to the geometry as it is affected by kinetic forces (like centrifugal force when turning at high speeds, or abruptly stopping or accelerating).  As you race through the tracks, all with their own gameplay twists and visual styles, the player has to utilize both the unique driving abilities of the chosen character, as well as cartoon style weaponry and items collected throughout t he race, to  beat the opponents to the finish line. ¬†The game was fairly well received by both gaming press and consumers, and was considered by many to be among of the better non-simulation style racing games on the            Playstation console at the time of its release.¬† ¬† Motor Toon Grand Prix is also compatible with the           negCon controller.¬† </div>  <div> Characters :                     Captain Rock (Pilot)                   Bolbox (Robot)                  Pen                  guin Bros.

""But forget steering - what about placing  a virtual cigarette on the dashboard as you throw a wheelie down a  canyon? Throwing banana skins from the window? This is the thrill I have  been missing for many years. It's time we got back to driving basics:  cartoon characters in karts, not Ford Kas."" (Story from www.computerandvideogames.com) </div> "

Although it could be seen as a drug allusion, with the design style and music mirroring 90's club culture, the title also refers to the use of N20 in internal combustion engines to temporarily add extra power. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay was comprised of piloting a craft down a stage, shooting insect-like creatures while gaining power-ups and collecting coins. The stages were usually tunnel-shaped, enabling full 360 degree of movement around the cylindrical walls, while others were a track that contorted and swayed. The soundtrack contains music by The Crystal Method. Although some tracks were Crystal Method songs remixed by other artists, the majority of the music was lifted from their 1997 debut album, Vegas. The graphics were influenced by the beat of the music in some stages, often causing colorful light to pulsate down the tubes in time with the background tune.With mixed reactions from critics and mediocre sales, N2O: Nitrous Oxide quickly became a bargain bin title. The game is an interesting take on the shoot-em-up genre as well as an interesting use of a soundtrack. </div> "

Along with a custom name, uniform color, wacky head, and a ""nickname"" for the announcer, players can distribute their attributes from a limited point pool (which gets larger the more that player wins).The game later received ports for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis on November 1996, both ported by Funcom and published by Midway themselves (rather than Acclaim, who previously published ports of NBA Jam). It was later ported by Midway Studios San Diego and Director's Cut International to the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Windows PCs in early 1997.Earlier versions of NBA Hangtime (as well as the home versions) included a NBA trivia quiz after each game for bragging rights, additional attribute points (home version only), and a chance to win prizes (arcade version only). The game later received an update in November 1996 as NBA Maximum Hangtime, updating the roster to match the 1996-97 season while adding new secrets and a new ""hot spots"" system, where each basketball player has a hidden spot on the court where they shoot more accurately. It was later succeeded by NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : TeamPlayersAtlanta HawksStacey AugmonMookie BlaylockSteve SmithChristian LaettnerKen NormanBoston CelticsDee BrownDana BarrosEric MontrossDino RadjaRick FoxCharlotte HornetsKenny AndersonLarry JohnsonGlen RiceGeorge ZidekDell CurryChicago BullsScottie PippenDennis RodmanToni KukocLuc LongleySteve KerrCleveland CavaliersTyrone HillChris MillsBobby PhillsTerrell BrandonDanny FerryDallas MavericksJim JacksonJason KiddJamal MashburnPopeye JonesGeorge McCloudDenver NuggetsMahmoud Abdul-RaufDikembe MutomboAntonio McDyessJalen RoseDale EllisDetroit PistonsJoe DumarsGrant HillTerry MillsOtis ThorpeAllan HoustonGolden State WarriorsKevin WillisLatrell SprewellRony SeikalyJoe SmithChris MullinHouston RocketsHakeem OlajuwonClyde DrexlerRobert HorrySam CassellKenny SmithIndiana PacersReggie MillerDale DavisRik SmitsDerek McKeyMark JacksonLos Angeles ClippersLoy VaughtRodney RogersLamond MurrayPooh RichardsonBrent BarryLos Angeles LakersNick Van ExelVlade DivacCedric CeballosElden CampbellEddie JonesMiami HeatAlonzo MourningWalt WilliamsRex ChapmanTim HardawayPredrag DanilovicMilwaukee BucksVin BakerGlenn RobinsonShawn RespertBenoit BenjaminSherman DouglasMinnesota TimberwolvesIsaiah RiderAndrew LangSpud WebbTom GugliottaKevin GarnettNew Jersey NetsKendall GillShawn BradleyArmon GilliamEd O'BannonKevin EdwardsNew York KnicksPatrick EwingAnthony MasonDerek HarperCharles OakleyJohn StarksOrlando MagicAnferenee HardawayHorace GrantNick AndersonDennis ScottJon KoncakPhiladelphia 76ersJerry StackhouseDerrick ColemanClarence WeatherspoonTrevor RuffinVernon MaxwellPhoenix SunsKevin JohnsonWayman TisdaleDanny ManningWesley PersonMichael FinleyPortland Trail BlazersRod StricklandClifford RobinsonArvydas SabonisBuck WilliamsRandolph ChildressSacramento KingsBilly OwensMitch RichmondBrian GrantSarunas MarciulionisTyus EdneySan Antonio SpursSean ElliotDavid RobinsonAvery JohnsonChuck PersonVinny Del NegroSeattle SupersonicsShawn KempGary PaytonDetlef SchrempfHersey HawkinsSherell FordToronto RaptorsCarlos RogersDamon StoudamireAlvin RobinsonOliver MillerTracey MurrayUtah JazzJohn StocktonKarl MaloneJeff HornacekDavid BenoitChris MorrisVancouver GrizzliesGreg AnthonyBlue EdwardsByron ScottBryant ReevesEric MurdochWashington BulletsJuwan HowardChris WebberCalbert CheaneyRobert PackGeorghe Muresan </div> "

It uses the 1996-97 NBA season roster.The game was later ported by Sculptured to the Sony PlayStation (in October 31, 1996), Sega Saturn (in November 30, 1996), and PC (in January 31, 1997), updating the roster for late-1996. </div> "

It also features ""Tournament Mode"", which disables all cheat codes and special characters while reducing the ""rubber-banding"" effect in player-vs-player matches.The game received home console ports through 1995-1996, first for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Gear, then for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Jaguar, Sega 32X, MS-DOS PCs, and Game Boy. These were published by Acclaim, and most were ported by Iguana Entertainment, with the GB version ported by Torus Games and the Jaguar version ported by High Voltage Software. These versions include an updated roster (from the 1994-95 NBA season) and new game options (including power-up icons, ""hot spots"", faster game speed, and an injury system).Both early arcade versions and the console ports are known for building up their list of unique hidden characters, with the early arcade versions including guest characters from the studio's Mortal Kombat series (which were removed shortly after release) and the console versions including some NBA mascots, retired sports icons, the American rap group Beastie Boys, the American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Charles, Prince of Wales.Some of the console ports were later used for the spin-off College Slam, while the original arcade version later received a successor with NBA Hangtime. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the ""Turbo"" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the ""???"" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the ""Quick Hands"" and ""Max Power"" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include ""Power-up"" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : Hotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. ""Hot Spots"" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. ""Power-up"" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant ""on fire,"" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a ""Juice"" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an ""Injury"" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional ""Tag Mode"" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions. </div> "

The landmark addition in NBA Live 2003 was Freestyle Control, which was met with some enthusiasm by fans though some did not like the limited moves that were available to keyboard users. Although the concept itself was not unpopular (and continues to be used with Quick Strike Ankle Breakers today) most felt Freestyle Control was too powerful in NBA Live 2003 and the game too fast-paced with scores easily exceeding 150 points apiece when playing twelve minute quarters. NBA Live 2003 was also derided for its ""Courtside Comedy"" approach to cutscenes which players felt detracted from the intended atmosphere of an NBA simulation. Arcade-like effects such as booming sound effects and blocks which rocketed the ball to the opposite baseline were also amongst the common complaints.The return to the PC platform was welcomed by patchers however and several patches were made including ""Tweaked Rosters"" which attempted to combat some of the issues with gameplay.

NHL Rock the Rink,EA Canada,Electronic Arts,"March 16, 2000",ps,A three-on-three arcade-style hockey game which makes use of the license granted by the NHL and its players' association to create a lightning-fast arcade style game as opposed to the more nuanced aspects of an NHL simulation.,3030-10605,10605,0,2000-02-29,https://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-rock-the-rink/3030-10605/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : NHL Rock the Rink is an arcade-style hockey game developed and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation.The basic concept is a fast-paced game of three on three, with the player free to choose among premade arcade teams or seven-man versions of actual NHL teams. In the former instance, the player can play as one of the premade teams such as the Brigade, Demons or Psycho-delics, or a separate team can be created, albeit with the player able to create only the team name and to choose two of the available shift combinations. The latter instance has the player working through the ranks of the NHL squads, starting with the worst teams from the 1998-1999 season, and eventually facing the Stanley Cup champions from that year, the Dallas Stars. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is very simplified compared to actual NHL gameplay, even when compared to the rule changes implemented following the strike that wiped out the 2004-2005 season. There are no penalties, no icing calls, and goalies are fair game when it comes to the in-game violence. The object of each game is to reach a predetermined number of goals (ranging from 3 to 20) before the opponent. There is no game clock, which means that a first-to-20 game could take a considerable amount of time to complete. Fortunately, there are other settings, such as catch-up AI and a ten-second shot clock, which help keep the game moving at a sufficient pace.The home arenas for the arcade teams (with the exception of the created teams, who play in a nondescript warehouse) are designed with their respective teams in mind. For instance, the Brigade's home ice features a tank shooting wildly in the background, while the Cabbies appear to play in the old stage set for the TV show Taxi, while the Demons play in a red-and-black arena surrounded by fire, and so on. Most of the house announcers are made to go along with the motif, e.g. the Brigade's rink announcer sounds much like a stereotypical Lee Ermey-type drill sergeant, while the Demons have a sinister Bela Lugosi-like voice, the Cabbies a quintessential New York City dispatcher voice (after a visitor's goal, for instance, he'll shout ""Dat's okay, we don't stop for red lights anyway!""), the Psycho-delics have a stereotypical stoner dude, and so forth. Some teams (the Mobsters and Demolition, for instance) have a generic rink announcer. The play-by-play consists of a barrage of one-liners, often making reference to older popular songs (i.e. ""Much like love, that hit was exciting and new"" or ""Oh, how deep is your glove!""), and saving the most groan-inducing lines for goal-scoring instances (""And he puts the thingamabob into the whatchamacallit!""). </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The soundtrack consists of a number of songs by the Hanson Brothers, who, not to be confused for the teen-pop group with the short career, were best-known for their antics in the Paul Newman movie Slap Shot. The game also features the song ""Celebrity Skin"" by Hole in its opening sequence. </div>  <div> Trivia : At 8.8 out of 10, it remains Jeff Gerstmann's highest rated hockey game ever. </div> "

The game was released in 1998 to mixed reviews. The aim of the game is to guide one of five personified dominoes across six different stages. The two characters selectable from the beginning of the game are Mr. and Miss Domino, both characters move at regular speed except that Miss Domino skips instead of running. Additional characters can be unlocked by completing tasks and stages. The way that Mr. Domino must advance through stages is by clearing all obstacles and tiles on a given stage. The stages are set up like board games, the player can go around the board as many times as needed until all of the obstacles are cleared. Moving around the board however presents a challenge by itself because once Mr. Domino starts running he stops for no one, the only way to control his direction is by aiming his body in the right way by tapping the directional pad. On top of trying to navigate the course enemy dominoes will try and hinder the player‚Äôs progress by throwing fruit and dice on the track and triggering electrical wires.Mr.Domino making his way across the casino stage.The player only has a small amount of time to complete the game because as the game progresses Mr. Domino slowly turns from white to black and if the player has not completed the stages by the time that the domino has turned fully black, it‚Äôs game over. The only way to prevent Mr. Domino from turning black before time runs up is by properly managing the scarce supply of heal blocks scattered across the courses. </div>  <div> Reception : The game received mostly mediocre to positive reviews, being praised for its interesting and unique style while also being criticized for the very short game length. Game Revolution named it the number 11 all time ‚Äúworst name for a video game‚Äù and Game Informer listed it as one of the top 10 ‚Äúweirdest games‚Äù ever.The Nintendo Wii game Domino Rally was initially rumoured to be a spiritual successor to No One Can Stop Mr. Domino, but this is not the case; the gameplay of Domino Rally is nothing like that of No One Can Stop Mr. Domino.Giant Bomb's own  Ryan Davis was a gigantic fan of No One Can Stop Mr. Domino. </div>  <div> Unlockable Dominoes : The player can unlock more playable dominoes by doing well on the stages. These dominoes have different abilities than then the starting dominoes, the following is a list of all playable dominoes:The entire Domino ensemble. Mr. Domino- A well balanced character and speedy runner, he moves at a constant pace and is relatively easy to handle.

Enlisting the help of local resistance fighter Naja Hana, STRIKE liberates Indocine from Lemonde's influence but is unable to capture the device, instead tracking the radiation signature to the Lavu Royale, a small island chain somewhere in the South China Sea. Though the islands are under the watch of Napoleon Hwong, a warlord for the reigning Octad, the intervention of STRIKE and a local gun for hire Harding Cash cuts down many of the Octad's operations in the surrounding region and eliminate the warlord himself.

Released in November 1998 to the same critical acclaim (notably for its wonderful 2D graphics and graphically stunning cutscenes which were entertaining as well) as the first title.A cinematic platformer with a dark sense of humor, Abe's Exoddus is considered a bonus title in the Oddworld series because it is not part of the main quintology.While Abe's Exoddus maintains the core gameplay of the original, it also includes numerous additions such as quick saves, mudokons with different emotions and conditions which alter gameplay (for example, blind mudokons will follow the sound of Abe's voice until he tells them to stop, even if it means their death, while angry mudokons will spitefully activate traps that endanger Abe) and the ability to posess a wider array of things including Paramites, Scrabs, Glukkons and even Abe's own farts after drinking the potent and noxious SoulStorm Brew.Abe travels through several areas including the Necrum Mines, FeeCo Depot, Slig Barracks and Bonewerkz before infiltrating the SoulStorm brewery itself, rescuing enslaved Mudokons and sabotaging the work of the Magog Cartel's invasive industries along the way. </div>  <div> Story : Abe leading his followers to the Necrum Burial Grounds.Abe's Exoddus takes off where Abe's Oddysee ended. Abe, the protagonist of the first game and floorwaxer-turned-renegade liberator of the Mudokon slaves of RuptureFarms, returns home to a hero's welcome from all the Mudokons he successfully rescued. During the celebratory furor, the clumsy Abe trips and is knocked unconscious. He is then visited by a vision from the ""Three Weirdos"". The Weirdos tell Abe about a new threat posed by the Magog Cartel, the corporate alliance responsible for the operation of Oddworld's various invasive and morally questionable industrial enterprises. Abe learns the Cartel is using legions of Mudokon slaves to mine Necrum, the sacred Mudokon city of the dead, in order to collect their bones for some unknown purpose. So clandestine is the operation that the Glukkons have taken to stitching shut the eyes of a number of their Mudokon workforce to prevent their schemes from being known. The Weirdos explain they are the spirits of those disturbed bones, and beg Abe to travel to Necrum to put an end to the Cartel's exploitation.""We're not supposed to be here!""Abe and a group of enthusiastic Mudokons set out across the desert to find the Necrum Burial Grounds and free the slaves. Though Abe is determined, his band of followers quickly tire of travelling across the desert. Just as they are about to give up and go home, they hear a noise in the distance getting closer and closer. Suddenly, a monolithic train screams past them as it hurtles its way into the Necrum Burial Grounds. With new-found hope, Abe and his buddies set off and follow the train. When they finally arrive at the Burial Grounds (now rebranded Necrum Mine according to an ""Under New Management"" sign bolted to its newly barricaded entrance) they climb the fencing and enter. Just as they get in, Abe loses his footing, slips and falls down a set of cliffs, cutting him off from the rest of the group and beginning the first level of the game.After navigating his way through a portion of the Necrum Mines, Abe stumbles across his buddies who have subsequently been corralled and put to work as miners themselves. Rescued from this, the group decide to celebrate by partaking in the drinks offered freely by a nearby SoulStorm vending machine. Abe refuses to drink any, reasoning that ""If the brew's made by Glukkons, it's probably bad for us"", much to the chagrin of his thirsty compatriots. The toxic nature of the addictive brew soon becomes apparent as Abe's friends become ill and unable to escape. Inspecting a bottle of the brew, Abe discovers - to his horror - that SoulStorm Brew is made from the Mudokon's own bones. Abe resolves to journey to the Soulstorm Brewery itself in order to stop production of the dangerous drink which has convinced scores of Mudokons, desperate for their fix, to be wilfully enslaved for the promise of all the brew they can drink. In reality, the Mudokons are given nothing, and are frequently tortured for their tears - another essential ingredient of SoulStorm Brew.After explosively sabotaging operations in the Necrum Mines, Abe finds himself stranded in the jungles of Necrum proper, having been forced to leave his friends behind. After contending with a local infestation of Fleeches, Abe journeys through the Mudanchee and Mudomo vaults, two once-sacred Mudokon temples. The Mudanchee vaults, inhabited by Scrabs, have been long-defiled by the Glukkons, while the Mudomo vaults are unrecognisable owing to the extensive nesting of Paramites. By completing trials within the once-sacred vaults, Abe earns the ability to heal Mudokons sick from brew.From left: Phleg, Aslik and Dripik discuss the threat of ""That Abe Guy""Returning to the collapsed remains of the Necrum Mines, Abe cures and finally rescues his band of friends before stealing aboard transportation to The FeeCo Depot, an industrial freighting company used by the Magog Cartel to ship its abhorrent products across Oddworld. As Abe does so, unbeknownst to him, three top-most executive Glukkons anticipate his arrival: General Dripik, commander of the Slig Barracks; Vice President Aslik, administrator of the Depot; and Director Phleg, owner of Bonewerkz, the manufacturing company responsible for turning excavated bones into products. The trio decide to tighten security across all of their operations to deter Abe, already infamous among the Glukkons as the notorious ""terrorist"" responsible for the destruction of RuptureFarms, from infiltrating SoulStorm Brewery. The executives triple-lock the main security gates which lead to the brewery, and announce that it may only be opened with direct confirmation from each of the three high-ranking Glukkon executives.""Disarm the main gate! Do it!""Abe's quest therefore takes him through the infiltration of each of the trio's corporate institutions, freeing slaves and doing damage where he can before possessing each Executive and tricking Slig security into disarming the main security gate. Along the way, numerous news broadcasts made by the Magog Cartel, viewable on telescreens, depict the chaos and panic spread among the Glukkon executives as they become increasingly hysterical about their inability to capture the elusive Abe.""It's not fair! We had twice ze flavor!""Once the Glukkon executives are possessed and killed, all that remains is for Abe to infiltrate the SoulStorm Brewery and assassinate the Glukkon Brewmaster while overloading the brewery's boiler causing an irreparable explosion and haulting all production of SoulStorm Brew. The outcome of this final leg of the quest is dependant on how many slaves Abe managed to free along the way. If Abe has saved enough Mudokons to earn the good ending, a cinematic shows the Glukkon Brewmaster, unable to turn the valve of the boiler, lamenting the loss of his malicious creation while a crawling slig, also incapable of turning the valve cries, ""We're screwed! Pants! Pants! I need some pants!"" before the Brewery explodes in a devastating inferno. If Abe has not saved enough Mudokons and instead earns the bad ending, he is thwarted in the attempt and taken to be tortured. The Brewmaster, leering over Abe as his tears are collected for a special batch of brew, demands a Slig to ""PUMP IT UP!"" as Abe is electrocuted to death.""We knew there had to be more of us out there... and we were gonna find them.""In the epilogue of the good ending, Abe returns home, now to a sea of rescued Mudokons who cheer and celebrate over the return of their hero. Abe reflects on his many victories, but concedes that there are still many Mudokons across Oddworld who have not escaped the clutches of enslavement under the yoke of the Magog Cartel, and with resolve he promises to free his remaining brethren. As Abe and his followers raise their paws to the giant moon that orbits Oddworld, the scene is interrupted by a final Magog Cartel news broadcast which announces that Abe, ""the mastermind behind the destruction of RuptureFarms"" is also responsible for the closure of SoulStorm Brewery. The Slig newscaster asks viewers to ""stay tuned for more on this story as it develops,"" before stating ""this message is brought to you by"", at which point the Oddworld Inhabitants Logo and theme encompasses the screen and the credits begin to roll. </div>  <div> Endings : There are two different endings in the game depending on how many Mudokon slaves the player rescues.If Abe saves 0-149 slaves, players get the bad ending.If Abe saves 150-300 slaves, players get the good ending.Additionally, if all 300 Mudokons are saved, the player is rewarded with a concept art gallery, and if 276 Mudokons are killed, Abe is sent back to the FeeCo Depot with permanent invincibility. </div>  <div> Enemies : Mudos is home to a wide assortment of foes both natural and industrial.Pants! I need some pants!Crawling SligsBefore sligs equips a pair of mechnical pants, or a helicopter harness, they are a much less dangerous opponent. Despised by Glukkons, Mudokons and especially other Sligs, they are complete cowards and, when threatened, they rush to some equipment before attacking on sight.Depending on which equipment vendor they come across, Crawling Sligs can become standard walking Sligs or grenade flinging Flying Sligs.Here boy!Sligs Trained in the Slig Barracks, these abberations of machine and flesh form the primary security force for all Magog Cartel structures. Dim-witted and cowardly in the presence of their Glukkon masters, Sligs are cruelly treated, and treat their mudokon captives cruelly in turn.They use mechanical pants for mobility and are equipped with a machine gun. Often lazy, Sligs can be frequently found sleeping on the job - a vulnerable state that Abe can exploit using sneaking and possession.Somethin' smells!Flying SligsThese sligs are equipped with a harness that gives them the ability fly, and fire a flurry of explosives from their grenade launcher without hesitation.SlogSlogsThese monstrous, dog-like creatures are a Slig's best, and only, friend. Their speed makes running away the only viable option, though they are easily distracted by delicious bone treats.SloggieSloggiesBaby Slogs are younger, smaller, and not as fast as a full grown Slog. However, they are just as lethal when taking a nasty chunk out of Abe.FleechFleechesFleeches are a popular domestic pet for the Glukkons, but they inevitably grow too big and are subsequently flushed down the toilet. Colonies of these vicious creatures now infest Oddworld's underworld.SlurgSlurgsPathetic, useless, slug-like creatures. Alone, they are not a threat to Abe, but when stepped on they make a high pitched screech - alerting any foe in the area, particularly Fleeches.ParamiteParamitesParamites are fast, efficient, carnivorous hunters. However, Paramites are also ruthlessly intelligent, and will not display aggression when encountered alone unless Abe backs them into a corner. In groups of two or more, however, Paramites become ferocious and organised hunters.ScrabScrabs Scrabs are highly territorial and hardy predators that originated in the deserts of Mudos. Scrabs have beaks powerful enough to snap bone. Even when encountered alone, a Scrab will make short work of Abe's fragile body. Due to their profound territorial instinct, two Scrabs will always fight each other before the surviving predator turns its focus to Abe.GlukkonGlukkons Glukkons are the industrial capitalists of Oddworld. They own and control the Magog Cartel - or at least, are the highest of its ranks encountered by Abe. Glukkons are inherently greedy, industrious, ruthless, and selfish.Their legs are worthless stumps, forcing them to walk upright on hands supported by long, spindly arms. They are therefore unable to perform most tasks by themselves, instead commanding Sligs to do things for them.Glukkons cannot attack Abe directly, but the status of a Glukkon ensures they are never far from armed protection - by merely shouting for help they can often summon Sligs to their aid.GreeterGreetersFirst used as self-promoting vending machines until they severely malfunctioned, Greeters began serving as security guards in the Feeco Depot after it was discovered they had the habit of electrocuting their customers. </div>  <div> Teasing Munch's Oddysee : Comin' Soon!In the final cinematic of the game, a short teaser for Munch's Oddysee was shown. The tease consists of the game's logo being displayed, while a Mudokon cheerfully quips ""and don't even think about running it on your measly 32-bit system!""However, the game would later be released exclusively for the Xbox, a platform which did in fact utilize a 32-bit processor. On December 20th 2010, Oddworld Inhabitants released both Munch's Oddysee and Stranger's Wrath for the PC in a compilation entitled The Oddboxx.Other references to Munch's Oddysee were included in the manual for Abe's Exoddus. Additionally, a doorway leading to the Vyker's Labs - a location in Munch's Oddysee - can be found in the Feeco Depot. The entrance is boarded up, however, and bears a painted sign which reads ""Comin' Soon!"" </div>  <div> Remake : On the 13th April 2015, Lorne Lanning made an appearance on the Kinda Funny Games stream hosted by Colin Moriarty and Greg Miller. During the show, Lorne revealed that development studio Just Add Water was planning to begin production on a ""full, ground-up remake"" of Abe's Exoddus, presumably in the style of Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty.

Originally released in 1997 by eponymous developer Oddworld Inhabitants, the game is a flip-screen-based 2D platformer that places an emphasis on lateral thinking and puzzle-solving. It was well-received by reviewers and was praised for its innovative ""GameSpeak"" system, as well as its unique artistic style. The original game has spawned multiple successful sequels.Abe's Oddysee was re-released on various digital distribution services including PSN, Steam and GOG.com. The Steam release coincided with the release of the ""OddBoxx,"" an Orange Box-inspired compilation which includes Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD.Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee New 'n' Tasty! was announced in 2012 as a full high-definition remake under development by Oddworld-veteran studio Just Add Water. A community vote was held in which fans chose the name of the remake. New 'n' Tasty! features brand-new 3D graphics and updated gameplay to accommodate the new scrolling camera which replaces the original game's flip-screen level design. The remake was released for PlayStation 4 on July 22, 2014. </div>  <div> Story : The game begins with narration by protagonist Abe, a Mudokon slave who works at RuptureFarms 1029, the largest meat-processing plant on Oddworld. Abe, along with many of his fellow Mudokons, is a slave to Molluck the Glukkon: the ruthless, profit-hungry boss of RuptureFarms and de facto head of the Magog Cartel.Molluck (right) and his assistant Slig at the RuptureFarms annual board meetingWhile working a late shift as a first-class floor-waxer, Abe eavesdrops on the RuptureFarms annual board meeting. The Glukkon board members argue about a steep drop in profits due to the dwindling populations of Scrabs and Paramites, the two primary livestock animals harvested for their meat. As a terrified Abe looks on, Molluck coolly outlines a plan to grind up his own Mudokon slaves as meat for ""Mudokon Pops"": the next ""New 'n' Tasty"" product from RuptureFarms.Abe quickly escapes the processing plant, rescuing other Mudokons and evading Slig security forces along the way. Passing through the Stockyards' perimeter fences under cover of night, Abe observes one of Oddworld's full moons bearing the distinctive pawprint of the Mudokons on its face. When he stretches his own hand out towards the moon, the cliff beneath him gives way, causing Abe to fall and hit his head.While unconscious, Abe receives a vision from the Mudokon shaman Big Face. The shaman tells Abe to restore the balance of the land by traveling to the Monsaic Lines, a series of carved stone caves containing a temple built long ago by the spiritual Mudokons. From there, Abe must overcome trials in the deserts of Scrabania and in the forests of Paramonia, the locations of two more sacred temples dedicated to Scrabs and Paramites, respectively. Abe carefully traverses these ancient Mudokon proving grounds and receives mystical tattoos from Big Face on each of his hands depicting the two sacred animals; this gives Abe the ability to transform into the mythical Shrykull, a powerful demigod-like fusion of Scrab and Paramite.Abe returns to RuptureFarms and makes good use of his new-found powers to rescue the remaining Mudokon workers from their designated Zulags and assassinate several Glukkon board members; unfortunately, he is soon captured and restrained in a cell by Molluck's forces. Abe is finally met by Molluck himself, who has his Slig assistant activate the meat grinder directly beneath Abe's cell in one last attempt to exterminate the rebellious Mudokon and restore Glukkon control over RuptureFarms.Abe's Oddysee has two basic endings, depending on the total number of Mudokons rescued. There are a total of ninety-nine Mudokons in the game, some of which are hidden in secret areas.If Abe rescues fifty or more Mudokons, the freed Mudokons will unite and summon powerful lightning to incapacitate Molluck and his Slig assistant. Big Face arrives to teleport Abe from RuptureFarms and into the new Mudokon refuge at the Monsaic Lines, where Abe is celebrated as a hero.If Abe rescues less than fifty Mudokons, the few Mudokons that escaped RuptureFarms decide Abe is a schmuck and not worth saving; Abe falls into the meat grinder while Molluck and his assistant laugh at his grisly demise.The original PlayStation version of the game includes a secret third ending seen by rescuing all ninety-nine Mudokons; it shows an imprisoned Abe being tormented by a strange and talkative mechanical creature. This video and ""The Shrink"" character featured in it were reportedly intended as teasers for a future Oddworld Inhabitants advertising campaign which never materialized. </div>  <div> Gameplay : All gameplay in Oddworld is 2D flip screen puzzle-platforming. Players maneuver protagonist Abe through dangerous terrain, avoiding pits, enemies and other traps with quick movement as well as by interacting with various objects in the environment. Abe has no means of direct attack; instead, he has the unique ability to Chant, allowing Abe to possess hostile Sligs on the same screen and giving the player temporary access to the Sligs' move set and abilities. Chanting can also be used to open special ""bird portals"" through which his surviving fellow Mudokons can escape from RuptureFarms, and these portals are occasionally used by Abe himself for transport. Abe's ultimate power, the invincible Shrykull, is unlocked in the final hours of the game; when a certain number of Mudokons are rescued per area, Abe can momentarily transform into a demigod and destroy all on-screen enemies with a single attack.The various inhabitants of Oddworld, including Abe, can be abused or killed by the player in a multitude of different ways throughout the game, contributing to the series' reputation for dark humor. </div>  <div> GameSpeak : The GameSpeak command listOne of the most innovative aspects of Oddworld's gameplay was the GameSpeak feature. Using GameSpeak, the player is able to directly interact with the friendly Mudokons and issue commands to lead them to safety. These NPCs can be used to assist with solving puzzles in certain areas.Possessing Sligs enables an alternate set of GameSpeak commands; however, this is only useful in a few areas and was mostly intended for entertainment purposes in Abe's Oddysee. The possession mechanic was was expanded in subsequent games and would become an even more significant aspect of puzzle-solving in Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus and Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The original score for Abe's Oddysee was composed by Ellen Meijers and Josh Gabriel.Track #Song TitleRunning Time01GT Interactive Logo00.0902Oddworld Inhabitants Logo00.1103Opening00.3004So Get Over it!00.1105This is RuptureFarms03.4206Wanted00.2107RuptureFarms08.1208Barrel Ride00.2509Tension01.1210Slig Action01.0511Free-Fire Zone03.2812Abe's Moon01.2913Monsaic Lines05.4514Entering Paramonia00.1815Paramonia10.0316Entering the Paramonian Temple00.1617Paramonian Temple03.4518Paramonian Slig Action01.0719Paramonian Nest02.1520Paramonian Trials Completed00.2421Entering Scrabania00.1822Scrabania03.0223Entering the Scrabanian Temple00.2024Scrabanian Slig Action00.5625Scrabanian Temple02.4826Scrabanian Nest02.4227Scrabanian Trials Completed00.2328Shrykull Revealed00.1829Board Room00.1730The Factory Halts00.2131Captured00.3432Bad Ending00.2933Good Ending01.2334Bonus Ending: teaser00.3135Credits01.09 </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : Pentium 120 MHz CPU (minimum), Pentium 166 MHz CPU (recommended)SVGA 16bpp-compatible graphics4x CD-ROM drive8MB RAM (minimum), 16MB RAM (recommended)Sound Blaster-compatible sound card or Wavetable sound card (recommended)700 MB disk space </div> "

The game is not so much known for its play, which was not bad but hardly amazing, but because it was one of the few to recognize that it's FMV sequences were rather horrible and tried to redeem them by instituting an MST3K-esque set of shadows (Doug Benson and Brian Posehn) at the bottom of the screen mocking it. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Off-World Interceptor was an on rails vehicular combat game. The player could drive as far to the left and right as they wanted provided there wasn't an obstacle blocking their path but they could never turn around. The levels are fairly large for the time of the game's release and there was quite a bit of action going on at any given moment which would at times lead to a drop in frame rate. The player would be able to get power ups for all the weapons as well as money to buy new weapons, lives, and powerups in between missions. Vehicles had jump jets that allowed them to leap over certain obstacles, incoming fire, and enemies. Each level is timed, if the time limit expires the entire area is destroyed via bombs and the player must start the level over. At the end of each segment which is composed of multiple stages the player must fight a boss character which is followed by a cinematic sequence. </div> "

It should be noted that despite being the first game released in the Ogre Battle series it is actually the fifth game in terms of storyline. Taking place twenty four years after the formation of the brutal Zetegenian Empire, the people of the old kingdoms live under constant persecution by the current regime. As the ambitious leader of the rebel army the player is tasked by the old wizard Warren to gather their forces and liberate the people from oppression. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game was unique at its time being an odd hybrid of real time strategy and RPG. The game progresses linearly (aside from certain secret levels unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements during battle) leading the player from one battle to the next. Before these battles the player can manage his army with a variety of options. Most importantly is the formation of squads, which are created by grouping together units. There are a large variety of units ranging from doll masters to werewolves as well as several special hero units (though many are just improved versions of existing classes). Squads consist of three to five units placed on a three by three grid, with their placement on this grid dictating their actions in battle. As with most RPGs, units gain experience and level, often leading to more advanced classes. Units can also be equipped with items to further increase their effectivenessBattles take place in real time on large maps with the player starting at his home base and fielding his squads into the battle at a cost. The player controls his squads by issuing move orders which they fulfill to the best of their ability. The objective is to reach the enemy's stronghold and liberate it by occupying that space while preventing the enemy from taking the player's own base. Along the way towns can also be liberated to help the player's cause. Towns provide information, units to hire, items to buy, and income. When an enemy squad comes into contact with a player's squad the two squads ""fight it out"" in a quick computer controlled battle. The units in both squads act out whatever actions their placement dictates, with the squad suffering the most damage or losing their leader unit being declared the loser and as a result being pushed backwards on the map. The user has limited control in these battles with only a few options such as using a limited number of tarot cards (magic spells) or giving the AI a certain routine to follow such as attack the leader. This continues until one side's home base is captured. The story is presented during battles through conversations when encountering certain squads (generally the boss squad sitting their home base) and also through brief cut scenes between battles.While the game is lauded for its depth in terms of customization it is also criticized for its brutal learning curve. Many features are poorly documented or explained, and as a result can only be discovered via trial and error. Many a player would unwittingly progress quite far into the game only to realize his forces have been improperly trained and are vastly inferior when compared to the enemy. The game also featured multiple endings, however due to the aforementioned poor documentation; Especially in regards to the reputation and alignment system, many players would receive a ""bad"" ending, where they themselves have become a blood thirsty tyrant with many of the characters they encountered plotting against them. Whether this is some kind of social commentary about the nature of war or simply poor game design has yet to be and probably never will be determined.Despite these criticisms the game is loved by fans for its massive depth, endearing charm, and poignant storyline. </div>  <div> Trivia : The band Queen is said to have inspired Yasumi Matsuno when creating the series. References to the band's second album, Queen II, can be seen within the Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen. Most notably are the songs Ogre Battle and March of the Black Queen which obviously served to inspire the game's name, not to mention Let Us Cling Together the subtitle to Ogre Battle's sequel. </div> "

Omega Boost,Polyphony Digital,Sony Computer Entertainment,"August 31, 1999",ps,"Omega Boost is a 3D shoot'em up developed by Polyphony Digital, makers of the Gran Turismo series, for the Sony PlayStation.",3030-9788,9788,0,1999-08-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/omega-boost/3030-9788/,ESRB: E," <div> Story : Omega Boost takes place in the year 2099, wherein a Sentient computer program, Alpha Core, has practically taken over the world. The player character is Lieutenant Lester, the pilot of Omega Boost, one of a series of humanoid mecha. In the opening FMV cutscene (featuring live actors and computer generated backdrops in the style of Wing Commander and Command and Conquer), Lester is tasked with travelling to Alpha Core's ""Time Shaft"", a space cannon which allows things flying through it to fly to a pre-determined time, to go back to the time when ENIAC (the first general purpose electronic computer) was invented and swap out a defective vacuum tube which spawns the Alpha Core virus for a new one.The destruction of Manhattan and Tokyo by the computer system Alpha Core is announced via intercom, and Lester is called to board Omega Boost. Upon starting a new campaign, the player is delivered to Planet ETA, which houses the Time Shaft. The player is ordered to destroy the many orbital and planet-based defenses, presumably controlled by Alpha Core, in order to enter the Timeshaft and fix ENIAC. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player can control the titular Omega Boost from both a first- and third-person perspective on the fly by pressing Select. The control scheme can be set so that thrusters are either always active, meaning constant forward movement with the ability to stop by holding R1, or the opposite (move by holding R1).By dragging the lock-on cursor over an enemy or target (the number of targets you can acquire at once starts at six and increases parallel with your level progression), Omega Boost launches a series of missile-like green homing lasers. Additionally, Omega Boost can perform a special attack called Viper Boost, in which the mech is engulfed in a blue aura while rapidly colliding into all onscreen enemies, which instantly destroys all non-boss enemies (bosses suffer significant damage). </div>  <div> Music : 14 tracks was composed and performed by CMJK. Different releases of the game had different opening and ending themes. The US version used ""Fly"" by Loudmouth as the opening song and ""The Road"" as the ending theme also by Loudmouth. The Japanese release used ""Shade"" by Feeder as the opening song and ""Ismeel"" as the ending theme by Dip in the Pool. The EU/AUS version used an updated version of ""Dreamer"" by Cast for both the opening and ending as well as the final boss. </div>  <div> References/Trivia : Famed anime creator and mecha designer Shoji Kawamori designed the mecha of Omega Boost.The visual style of Omega Boost's homing lasers is extremely similar to the ""Itano Circus"", an attack animation created by animator Ichiro Itano in which a great number of missiles and their contrails are depicted blooming from the rear of the titular mecha out in a forward motion. The trajectories are commonly animated as though they are truly moving individually, and inspired many in the industry to use similar conventions in their own productions. Kawamori worked with Itano on the Macross series of mecha anime, starting with Super Dimensional Fortress Macross in 1982, in which the Itano Circus was originally used.The Viper Boost concept and animation borrows heavily from the V-MAX system in the 1985-86 giant robot anime Blue Comet SPT Layzner. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rzhwekvfCEOmega Boost is brought up in the song My Console by Eiffel 65Of all the games Polyphony Digitalhas created, Omega Boost was the only shoot 'em up.

Both are unhappy with their careers so they attend a lecture on wizardry, being held by Vu, in an attempt to learn magic to break free from their unfulfilling careers. The lecture does not teach them anything, but afterward, they come across Vu's spellbook. Despite the cover containing a warning, saying that only fully trained wizards should read from it, they ignore this and start reading spells. They accidentally cast a spell causing a large green monster to completely destroy their hometown. They quickly decide on a plan to return the town to its original state and decide to go in search of the Wishing Machine, a machine that will grant any three wishes.Upon arrival at the Wishing Machine the machine grants them their three wishes. Fargus proclaims that they should wish for a million wishes, but the Wishing Machine tells them that it won't work. Fargus then wishes for a chicken, and a chicken appears. After Nikki asks why he did that, he says he wanted to see if it would work. Nikki then wishes for their hometown to be restored to its former state. The Wishing Machine grants the wish and Nikki goes outside to find that the town had in fact been restored. Fagrus then comes outside and Nikki says they still have one wish left, where Fargus clumsily replies ""I wish everyone was like us"" . They then look out over the town and sees that everyone is identical to Fargus. </div>  <div> Gameplay : While the game boasts technically proficient 3D graphics the gameplay happens on in a 2D plane. It is pretty standard 2D platforming in which the player must traverse environments and enemies to get to the end of the level. At the beginning of a level the player must decide whether to play as Fargus or Nikki. Fargus has a spinning kick move, while Nikki can do a double jump.There is treasure scattered throughout the level which the player can collect to gain bonuses. If the player collects 300 pieces of treasure they gain an extra life. If between 85% and 95% of treasure in a level is collected then a bonus platforming game is unlocked, and if 95% of treasure in a level is collected a bonus pinball mini-game is unlocked.There are three power-ups that Nikki and Fargus can obtain in level. The red power-up allows them to shoot fireballs which can kill enemies with varying amounts of hits. The blue power-up allows them to freeze enemies who can then be shattered by being hit once more. The third is the green power-up which allows them to shrink enemies. They can then be killed by being stepped on.There are portals in some of the levels as well, which turn the characters into different animals giving them special abilities. The frog can jump very high, the rhino can build up speed to charge at enemies and kill them the turtle can become invincible by hiding in its shell and the dragon can fly and shoot fireballs. Once the player has passed through a portal, passing through another one will change them back to normal. </div>  <div> Magical Hoppers : A drastically changed version of this game was released in japan under the name Magical Hoppers and featured new anime style cut scenes, soundtrack, and completely changed characters - Clam and Grumpy. </div> "

Fargus has been altered by laboratory experiments. In Nikki's words, he has become ""a freak, but in a good way. He's proud of his violent, maniacal side. He can't even tie his shoes, but he can build a thermonuclear bomb from common household items, and set a fortress on fire before you can say Werner Von Braun. He may be an idiot savant, but he's got great hair.""It is the year of the cheese, and all is not well in the world of Lyr. As was foretold in ancient texts, a comet, known as ""The Comet of Infinite Possibilities"" is passing over the skies above the world. It is said to contain much magical elements. Nikki dislikes studying magical texts, and decides to attempt to use the magical properties of the comet to advance her magical abilities. Unfortunately she is not the only person out to use the comet's powers for personal gain. The Goon Queen Zorrscha also plans to use use the comet's powers, but for evil. Nikki and Fargus must traverse the world to prevent Zorrscha's evil plans from becoming a reality.Unlike the original, when there was only one ending, Pandemonium 2 has two endings, depending on which character the player completes the game with. If the game is completed with Nikki she gains ultimate power over the universe, and is seen spinning galaxies and turning into a comet. If the game is completed with Fargus, he creates a new universe, in which everything resembles himself, Flowers, Tree's, everything looks like Fargus. </div>  <div> Gameplay  : The gameplay is much similar to the original Pandemonium. It is 2.5D, meaning that while the game features 3D graphics, all gameplay happens on a 2D plane. Players can select to either play as Fargus or Nikki at the beginning of the level. The player must traverse from one end of the level to the other, avoiding enemies and obstacles, while collecting treasure. Collecting 500 pieces of treasure will grant the player an extra life. Also, collection 80% of the treasure on an individual level will unlock a bonus speed run level, in which players must race from a vortex to the end of the level, collecting as much treasure as possible along the way. Reaching the end grants the player a large amount of treasure, usually enough to gain multiple lives.There are two power-ups within the game (a lightning power up, and a fire power up) that affect the players in different ways. If Nikki collects the fire power up, she can shoot fire balls. If Fargus picks up the fire power up, he becomes invincible, and will kill an enemy simply by touching them, however he must constantly move forward, and the only other ability he can use is a jump. The lightning power up gives Nikki the ability to fire a lightning bolt, which will freeze an enemy's movement. The player must then tap the attack button to damage the enemy. For Fargus, the lightning power up gives him the ability to inflate enemies, to the point where they explode.There are also several vehicles/machines which players can control at certain points of the game. These include tanks, trains, jet boots and more. </div>  <div> Miracle Jumpers  :  Pandemonium 2 was released in Japan as Miracle Jumpers.

In campaign mode, player assumes the role of german commander and fights in a series of historical and fictional scenarios (including¬† invasion of Great Britain, German victory in Stalingrad and even the attack on US soil). The novelty during the time of the game's release was not only the long (and in some cases, branched) campaign mode, but also the ability to reuse his troops from previous scenarios. Those units gained experience and carried it from battle to battle and could be upgraded with so called ""prestige points"", given to the commander for destroying enemy, claiming cities and ending battles in as few turns as possible. Single missions can be played on both sides--Axis and Allies.

This is accomplished by having a teacher in each stage rap a line, which PaRappa must copy afterward, similar to the game Simon. To rap, a line of button commands will appear at the top of the screen, which the player must match after the teacher shows them. The button commands match the flow of each teacher's rap. The player is scored on how accurate he/she is with each button press.The player's performance is ranked throughout the song and at the end of each stage as being either Cool, Good, Bad, or Awful. At the beginning of each stage, the score starts off on Good. After each line, the ranking will go up or down depending on how well the player matches the correct buttons and timing of the line. In order to get a Cool ranking, the player must freestyle two lines in a row during a stage, which means not necessarily following the button commands shown, but discovering a hidden pattern unique to each level. Two of those in succession will raise the score to Cool ranking and cause the current stage teacher to leave, which gives PaRappa the rest of the time to freestyle. If the player does not freestyle well, the teacher will return and the lessons will continue. The Cool ranking is unobtainable until the game has been completed once.There are two difficulty levels; easy and normal. On easy mode, the timing is less strict but the player may only reach Stage 3 (Prince Fleaswallow's stage). On normal mode, the player may complete the entire game. </div>  <div> Story : Parappa is head-over-heels in love with Sunny Funny. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to notice him all too much.

The game is a sequel to a novel of the same title by Hideaki Sena. With the success of Final Fantasy VII, Square had cemented itself as one of the leaders in videogame cinematics. They were attempting to bring their own mix of acclaimed CGI, quirky Japanese gameplay, and heavy plot to the market in a game akin to the Resident Evil series. The final product was acclaimed for these reasons, as well as its soundtrack and was considered of the same high quality of other Square games of the era.Many features of survival-horror titles are present in Parasite Eve, with the game including similar control schemes, limited survival-based item management, and menacing, grotesque enemies. The included battle system is more akin to other Square franchises, such as fifth generation Final Fantasy games, however Parasite Eve departed from their mechanics by allowing the player to move in battle, but employed an ATB gauge to have the action remain to some degree turn-based.The game garnered significant praise and acclaim upon release, garnering support for a Western-developed sequel that was released in North America in 2000.

Aya and her NYPD partner Daniel Dollis, an African American twenty-year veteran of the force investigate the mystery by visiting Dr. Klamp, the leading name behind mitochondrial research.Soon, the incident with Eve in the opera house turns into an onslaught against New York. In a murderous incident in Central Park, Eve slaughters thousands of people, absorbing them into a blob of mitochondrial biomass. The remaining inhabitants of New York are evacuated, leaving the city barren, and the military is called in to fight the creature. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A central mechanic is dodging enemy attacksThe game allows the player to traverse freely through designated areas of Manhattan. Once a player encounters a battle, enemies appear inside a set perimeter that restricts movement to that portion of the screen. A departure from previous Square RPG titles, the game has no transition to the battle mode and requires players to dispose of (or flee from) enemies in what is essentially the world map.The Active Time Bar (ATB) serves as the basis for the battle system--something of a replacement for the turn-based systems of previous RPG titles. This bar system allows the player to move around freely in the designated battle area while they wait for the bar to be filled and computer attacks to be performed.Attacks are the result of either direct fire of firearms or by the use of Parasite Enegy (PE), which utilizes Aya's special mitochondrial sensitivity and allows her to control the output of her focused attacks. The Parasite Energy has defensive measures as well, allowing the player to use standard RPG conventions in unfamiliar ways.A wire-frame polygon indicates the range of your weaponParasite Energy allows players to use their learned skills and traits for powerful attacks. Additionally, weapons and armor can be customized with tools, as well as super tools, in order to alter the attributes of each. To upgrade, players are required to sacrifice attributes on other weapons and armors to be transferred to the desired item. This adds a depth of unpredictability to the progression of players inventories, potentially increasing the replayability of the game.Parasite Eve was released in a time period just after the North American release of the Dual Shock controller, and was one of the first games to support it. Without the Dual Shock, Parasite Eve utilized the heavily-criticized ""tank"" control scheme of Resident Evil. Brea's movements were irritatingly slow unless players held down the circle button. Many players were pleased that it offered analog support, making the control of Brea much easier, though it was criticised for rendering the D-pad inoperative. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Disc 1 (52:34)1.

Parasite Eve II,Squaresoft,Square EA,"September 2, 2000",ps,"This sequel to Square's ""Cinematic RPG""  series has less cinema and more action, and is a truer survival horror experience.",3030-7361,7361,0,1999-12-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/parasite-eve-ii/3030-7361/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Parasite Eve II is the follow-up to the first ""cinematic RPG"" by Squaresoft, Parasite Eve. The sequel features a completely overhauled battle system, as well as far greater variety of environments and enemies. Developed and published by Square in 2000, the game further explores the mystery behind mitochondrial evolution presented in the original game. An indirect sequel, titled The 3rd Birthday, was released on mobile phone platforms and the PSP in 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The second game in the series departs somewhat dramatically from its predecessor in terms of the overall gameplay model. Parasite Eve II plays much more like an action game than an RPG, which is a fairly radical departure when compared side-by-side.The RPG elements are intact in some form or another, as the health points and mitochondria points are used once again, but it is mostly the experience points that encourage RPG-style gameplay.Perhaps the biggest departure from the original title is the removal of the ATB (Active Time Bar), thus eliminating the turn-based combat. The combat is now rendered completely in real-time, which allows more freedom for the player but also serves to alienate more ardent RPG fans.The weapons and armor customization has been downgraded somewhat, but also expanded in scope to include many more options--just with much less depth. Ammo is practically unlimited, as nearly every area has a limitless supply available that mostly prevents gamers from getting backed against the wall against enemies.Parasite Energy has returned, but has been specialized into more compartmentalized sections. Fire and Wind serve as Aya's offensive options, while the elements of Water and Earth compose what could be considered her defensive measures. There are a number of both old and new Parasite Energy skills, most of which are vital to completing the game. </div>  <div> Plot : The gameplay for Parasite Eve 2 was deeper but less stylish than the original. The fire and aim controls moved to the shoulder buttons.The horrors of mutated mitochondria haven't ended for Aya Brea, as she discovers what happened in the aftermath of the original Parasite Eve. Seeing the horrific power of Melissa Pierce as Eve, the United States military has been busy studying the phenomenon and adapting it for their weapons program.After the destruction of New York by the mitochondrial menace known as EVE in the original Parasite Eve, protagonist Aya Brea has left the New York Police Department to become an FBI operative. A special branch called M.I.S.T, the mitochondria investigation and suppression team, has been formed.Brea is called to the Akropolis tower when reports of a mitochondrial infestation are reported. She is sent to rendezvous with a swat team, but arrives to find them slaughtered - she is now alone and armed only with her trademark pistol.She discovers a new strain of creature from the first game, a Neomitochondrial creature which can take human form. One NMC, known as Golem No. 9, becomes the main antagonist. Wielding a machete, and wearing combat armor and a gas mask, he frequently cackles with maniacal laughter. No. 9 blows up the tower with explosives, and Brea escapes by helicopter with Rupert.Taking a 70s sports car, Brea follows up this incident by investigating the Midwest town of Dryfield - a creepy, nondescript town consisting of a motel, a gas station, and a diner. She finds Dryfield riddled with NMCs. With the help of a gun-loving Midwesterner named Douglas and his dog Flint, she discovers the third area of the game, The Shelter.The Shelter was originally an abandoned mine, but has military laboratories for genetic engineering hidden deep within. Brea learns that the NMCs were created by the United States military with her own DNA. Working with Kyle Madigan, a private investigator with a mission similar to her own, she finds the NEO-Ark, a showcase of creatures developed with the technology engineered from Brea's body.Among the creatures created was Eve, a child cloned of Brea's DNA, making her Brea's daughter is a certain sense. Eve is kidnaped by No. 09, who has formed an entire army of NMC golems, who attack Brea. Escaping with the help of a platoon of Marines, Brea rushes to the final encounter.No. 09 is trying to use eve with the technology of the Neo-Ark to resurrect the horror inflicted by Melissa Pierce in the first Parasite Eve. The United States military, acting on the orders of the president, attempts to destroy the evidence of their illicit weapons program. Firing on Dryfield from an orbital weapons platform, they attempt to destroy the NMC infestation. The floor cracks open, revealing a horrific giant monster that is several stories high. Eve's body has been absorbed partially into the creature. Brea defeats the monster, and escapes with her ""child. "" Hopefully, the horrors of the Neo-Ark have been destroyed. </div> "

Maya, a supporting character in the previous game, is now the lead protagonist while Tatsuya Su≈ç , the main character in the previous game, is now a supporting character. The remaining supporting characters from Innocent Sin are present in non-playable cameo form. The Persona franchise is known for its contemporary modern setting, demon collecting, unrelenting difficulty, and mix of comical and mature subject matter. </div>  <div> Story : The story begins with Maya, an editor for the magazine Coolest, receiving a cryptic, yet ominous letter from a serial killer known only as JOKER, reading ""You're next!"". Later, on assignment at Seven Sisters High School she and a fellow employee Yukino Mayuzumi witness a dispute between a student and the principal and later discover the principal dead in his office. When the police arrive, the student is suspected of the murder; however one of the detectives, Katsuya Su≈ç , suspects its actually linked to the JOKER killing spree. In fact it is, as the Joker shows up at the school and begins provoking Maya and Katsuya with the intention of awakening their inner Personae. Much to their surprise, he succeeds, and both of them having no knowledge of that which dwelled inside of them. Before he can finish Maya off, however, Tatsuya Suou shows up and drives JOKER off with his extremely powerful Persona. Just as quickly as he arrives, however, he leaves, leaving behind a plethora of unanswered questions. Maya, Katsuya, and eventually several others intend to investigate. </div>  <div> Characters : Persona 2: Eternal Punishment has 7 playable characters. They're listed below.Note: The year of birth is assuming the game takes places in 1999.Â§©ÈáéËàûËÄ∂ - Maya AmanoGeneral InformationAge: 23Height: 168 cmWeight: 48 kgDate of Birth: July 4, 1976Zodiac Sign: CancerOverview - Maya Amano's the silent protagonist of the game, who reprises her role as a reporter for a teen magazine called Coolest.

Her Persona is Maia („Éû„Ç§„Ç¢) of the Moons Arcana.Âë®Èò≤ ÈÅîÂìâ - Tatsuya Su≈çGeneral InformationAge: 18Height: 181 cmWeight: 68 kgDate of Birth: July 27, 1981Zodiac Sign: LeoOverview - Although not the protagonist of the game, Tatsuya is still the most important character in the story.

Ulala becomes involved with the JOKER case when she went to Seven Sisters High School with Maya. It was also there in which her Persona awakened. Ulala is riddled with self confidence issues, usually depending on men as a self esteem boost.Persona - Ulala, like Lisa Silvermen, uses her fist and her persona is Callisto ( „Ç´„É™„Çπ„Éà) of the Stars Arcana. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Persona 2's main gameplay mechanic hedges on summoning, leveling up, mutating various Personae, and using the right combination of their spells in the right order to initiate Fusion Spells. Also unique to the franchise is the ability to negotiate with demons for various advantages, which is covered in depth further down. The battle system is semi-automated, meaning once you assign your move to each character you leave the menu and the characters continually do the assigned attacks automatically until you toggle the menu again. As well as choosing moves, you can choose the initial order of attacks. However, after the initial order, the characters move based on their personal agility so if you're trying to continually do fusion spells, you'll need to re-order the characters often. </div>  <div> Persona Compendium : New Personae are summoned in a trans-dimensional area featured in every Persona game called the Velvet Room using tarot cards accumulated from demons in various ways. Each persona is affiliated with a sigil based on tarot card nomenclature(Justice, Moon, Hanged Man, Lovers, etc.) and can only be summoned with x amount of cards of their specific type, which are accumulated by defeating or negotiating with a demon of the same type, through sidequests, or through trading in blank cards for the card type you desire. Each demon(except bosses) you fight can be summoned as a Persona, but it will not appear on the summon list until you've fought it. For example, if a Pixie is desired as a summon, the player must battle it before it will appear on the list. A number of Lovers cards are still required to summon it. They can be obtained by defeating Pixies until the player has enough cards, at which point Pixie can now be summoned and attached to one of the player-controlled characters as a Persona. It should be noted, not every character can equip every Persona, and certain Persona are better suited to certain characters.(i.e., they will level up faster, have better stats, have a higher chance of mutation, etc.) Before summoning, a spell card can be attached, provided it is not the polar opposite of the element associated with the demon, as well as a card which gives the Persona a boost in one or all of its stats. </div>  <div> Persona EX Dungeon : The more you fight with a Persona attached, the more experience it gets and when it levels up, it learns a new spell. The higher level a Persona is, the more likely it is to mutate. A mutation can do various things such as boosting your Persona multiple levels instantly, learning a spell not on the Persona's spell list, or allowing the Persona to be upgraded into another, (normally) more powerful persona. In order to initiate a mutation, you must end a battle with a Fusion Spell. </div> "

In addition, the game features a simplistic universal chain combo system (""Flash Combos""), items that are dropped during the match (including throwable ""elemental orbs"" and healing food), and a special Gem system (where players upgrade their special moves during the match by collecting color-coded gems dropped by their opponent).The game was later ported to the Sony PlayStation in Japan (on June 11, 1998), North America (on July 1, 1998), and Europe (by Virgin on November 1998). This version was later re-released digitally via the PlayStation Network (as a PSOne Classics title) in North America (on February 8, 2011) and Japan (on April 13, 2011). The original game also received Japanese-exclusive ports to the Sega Saturn (on July 9, 1998) and WonderSwan (on April 6, 2000), and was included as part of the PlayStation 2 compilation Street Fighter Alpha Anthology. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Unlike many other fighters, Pocket Fighter has a relatively simple control scheme. In Pocket Fighter, only a punch, kick and ""special"" button is used, which in turn makes the game much easier and accessible to beginners. Another feature that is not included in other fighters, is the use of gems to control what special moves your character can do. These gems are dropped when you hit an opponent or a treasure chest. The more gems you collect of one color, the more powerful the special move is that relates to that color. In relation to other series that Capcom produced, each character keeps his/her own special move. Another unique feature of Pocket fighter, is the addition of power-ups - you can collect food to decrease damage on the health bar, as well as collect ""orbs"" that have some special function, such as a bomb that can be thrown, or turn the player into ice. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes all playable characters from Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo (with the exceptions of Donovan, Devilot, Mei-Ling, and Anita), as well as three new characters (Zangief, Ibuki, and Tessa) for a total of 12 playable characters (2 of which are hidden).Characters come from two main series (Street Fighter and Darkstalkers), with one coming from the game Red Earth. </div>  <div> Stages : RyuKenChun-LiZangiefSakuraIbukiAkuma - Known as Gouki in the Japanese version.

During the course of the games 25 levels you have to defeat three other Shamans' and their tribes in order to ascend to God-Hood. To do this you have to build a thriving village, train warriors, convert wild men and learn new spells. </div>  <div> Plot : The game marks a departure from the top down interface of the previous games, instead utilising a 3D engine and allowing for direct control over followers. This entry places the player in the shoes of a female Shaman, in command of a tribe on a quest for control of the solar system.Battling against three other Shamans who are in command of the opposing Dakini, Chumara and Matak tribes, you must wrest control of the 24 planets which serve as the games levels. Upon the way the player is able to use spells, courtesy of Stone Heads initially which require worship in order to dispense a set number to the players advantage. Most spells become unlocked after the Shaman enters the Vault of Knowledge with the spells symbol above it and extracts the essence of the spell. Further Vaults also unlock buildings which allow the player to create stronger warriors, preachers to convert the wild men and braves from the other tribes and spies to add an espionage element to the game.Upon completing the 24th level, the players Shaman becomes a God, and the 25th and final level becomes a free for all in which the player battles against all three other tribes in order to control the Solar System. The player is in this level omnipotent, able to cast spells an unlimited amount of times and from anywhere on the battlefield.An expansion called Undiscovered Worlds was released in 1999, continuing the story after the main campaign. You play as a new Shaman in the same timeline as the last game, who has to restore peace to the Solar System. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Player's Shaman observing a destructive Tornado spellTypically the player starts with only a Resurrection Site and a handful of tribesmen. In some levels a few buildings may already be pre-built, although usually the player must first begin to lay down houses to expand their population and generate Mana, required to cast spells. Regular braves are the construction Buildings such as warrior huts allow the creation of Warriors, a stronger fighting orientated unit capable of twice the amount of damage as a normal brave. In order to boost your population and train warriors. Several units can be trained. Normal villagers are needed for construction, which only uses wood. You also need villagers in huts to accumulate mana, and with this manna you can use spells. Only your Shaman can use spells, and every spell has a limited range. To beat a level, you need to kill every enemy villager and their Shaman. When every villager is killed, the Resurrection Site is destroyed, thus making it easier to kill the Shaman. With the site, the Shaman resurrects every time she dies.The levels are all planets in a solar system. You start on the planet farthest out, and work your way in. </div>  <div> Units : Shaman: The player's avatar within the game world- the Shaman is the most important unit in the game, as she is the only one who can cast the spells you have available. She has no other purpose aside from casting spells, and is not very useful as a direct combat unit. She has quite a bit more health than many of the unit types in the game, which allows her to directly fight against very low numbers of Braves and preachers in emergencies. But anything that's even remotely trained for combat, such as Warriors and Firewarriors, will make quick work of her if she's caught alone.Brave: The worker unit of the game, maintaining a strong population of braves is important since they generate the most mana out of all the follower types available. They are also the only ones who can build buildings and gather wood. Outside of these tasks, Braves are very weak in combat- with Spies being the only other kind of follower they can beat on their own. If you're forced to use Braves against Warriors or Fire Warriors, make sure they outnumber them at least 5 to 1- as you're going to lose most of them.Warrior: The simplest combat unit available for training- Warriors have the highest amount of health and direct combat damage output in the game. No other kind of follower in the game comes even close to their damage output in direct combat. These stats don't mean much if the odds are pitted completely against them by well-defended Fire Warriors, Preachers, or well placed spells though.Preacher: A utility combat unit that can greatly snowball the user's war effort if not properly countered. If advanced upon, Preachers are able to stop most follower types in their tracks and make them sit down to listen to tales praising their Shaman and religion. Given enough time, these followers will be converted to that Preacher's faction. The only units that cannot be stopped by a Preacher's sermon are other Preachers and the Shaman herself. Proper use of these units or spells is key in preventing the enemy from converting an entire attack force. If lucky- Fire Warriors can also counter Preachers, as long as they have an elevated position that lets them out-range the Preacher.Fire Warrior: The ranged combat unit of the game- Fire Warriors hurl fireballs at their targets. Most follower types are blown into the air briefly by these- greatly hampering their movement in and out of combat for as long as they are within the Fire Warrior's range. Warriors are the main exception to this- allowing them to completely counter undefended Fire Warriors. In proper numbers though, their damage output can kill even Warriors relatively quickly- and potentially shut down an enemy Shaman who moves too close. Elevated positions greatly increase their range- making Firewarriors ideal for defensive operations from Watch Towers as well.Spy: The spy is the weakest follower in the game when it comes to direct combat- having lower health than even a Brave. His real purpose though is to sabotage enemy buildings. The spy can disguise itself as a Brave of an enemy faction and partially damage enemy structures by setting fire to them. Spies cannot be used to completely destroy enemy buildings in this manner- but this method can still slow down an enemy- potentially briefly stopping the training of a certain follower type or slowing population growth. If a follower's AI has line-of-sight to the Spy's sabotage, or if that faction's shaman right-clicks on the spy, the spy's disguise will be broken, allowing that faction's followers to directly attack him. </div>  <div> Spells : The braves in the village spend a large amount of time in their houses, generating Mana to allow the player's Shaman to use her spells. </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Original Specifications:Pentium 133 MHz, 16 MB RAM, Windows 95,DirectX, CD-ROM drive, and 100 MB hard driveGOG.com Re-Release Requirements:Minimum system requirements: Windows XP or Windows Vista, 1.8 GHz Processor, 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended), 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended), 2GB HDD, Mouse, Keyboard. </div> "

Every member of the roster in Power Move Pro Wrestling is based on their Japanese couterpart in the original game (i.e. The Commandant is based on Keiji Mutoh; Agent Orange is based on Hiroyoshi Tenzan). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Instead of relying on arcade-style gameplay, like many other wrestling titles at the time, Power Move Pro Wrestling features a more strategic pace of play. The slower, grapple-based matches operate under a rock/paper/scissors balance of gameplay: strength grapples override submissions, submissions override strikes, and strikes override strength grapples. This system of balance encourages a more deliberate approach to gameplay, discouraging ""button-mashing"" and encouraging mastery of each wrestler's moveset. The execution of signature moves does not require any specific condition to be fulfilled, but are more difficult to implement earlier in matches due to the balance of the combat system.Power Move Pro Wrestling was one of the first 3-D wrestling games to incorporate an explicit body parts-based hit points system. As matches progress, submission holds and various manuevers cause damage to body parts. As damage builds, the wrestler's ability to move is affected, leading to reactions such as limping. Continued focus on specific body parts enables the attacker to achieve victory via submission. </div>  <div> Roster : The game features seven game modes, all based around one-on-one singles matches:1 Player (Single player exhibition match)2 Player (Multiplayer exhibition match)12-Man Gauntlet (Series of consecutive matches against every wrestler on the roster)Championship (Match against current PPW champion)PPW League (Round-robin style league with all wrestlers competing against each other for total points score, with wins=2, draws=1, and losses=0)PPW Tournament (Single-elimination tournament mode)Demo Match (Spectator mode, allowing two AI-controlled wrestlers to face off) </div> "

The third type is a semi mech game where the player is inside the Lightspeed Megazord and must defeat the enemies on screen. The final game type is sort of a flying game.

The game features numerous blood effects, including an end-of-round fatality system.Along with major arcade revisions (adding new special moves and abilities), the game received numerous ports for home consoles and handhelds in 1995. Other than the SNES version (which was ported by Bitmasters) and the PC version (which was ported by Teeny Weeny), all ports were done by Probe. They were released in North America and Europe by Time Warner Interactive for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, Game Boy, Game Gear, Jaguar CD (exclusively in North America), 3DO (exclusively in North America), Amiga (exclusively in Europe for ECS and AGA systems), and PC (released for MS-DOS in CD-ROM format). It was also released in Japan for the PS1 (on December 13, 1996 by Time Warner Interactive) and Saturn (on February 26, 1998 by GameBank).Along with a short-lived toyline, it also received a four-issue comic book mini-series years after the game's original release. A sequel named Primal Rage II was in development in 1996, adding a new assortment of giant playable human ""Avatars"" (also rendered from model figures) to fight alongside the beasts. Although this sequel was canceled prior to release, some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) of the sequel have been found, one of which is publically playable. Despite its cancellation, both games received an overarching novelization in 1997 (titled Primal Rage: The Avatars). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Glorified execution moves, known as Fatalities, can also be performed this way at the end of the winning round. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground, giving back some of their vitality. Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final endurance round to keep their place as ""king of the hill"". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish ""dinosaur graveyard"", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, they can immediately restore their character's initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes seven playable beasts (six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions). A final boss beast was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped and turned into an endurance match against the entire roster.Sauron and Blizzard are palette swaps of Diablo and Chaos. However, both Diablo and Chaos are smaller in size. Sauron (God of Hunger) Talon (God of Survival) Vertigo (Goddess of Insanity, unavailable in the GB and GG versions) Blizzard (God of Virtue) Chaos (God of Decay) Armadon (God of Life) Diablo (God of Destruction) </div> "

Fights take place within a large transparent cube that designates the level boundaries; however these can smash when an opponent is defeated. There are only three attack buttons in the game; a quick attack, a heavy smash attack, and an energy blast. The three of these can be combined to create simple combos.The fighting also has a strong emphasis on special projectile attacks, the use of which consumes energy from a power bar that recharges while the character is motionless. While the fighting may seem simplistic, a greater priority in the gameplay is usually given to timing and avoiding these special moves. </div>  <div> Characters : The game features eight characters, each of whom fight using a specific element NameGenderAgeElementCountryBurn Griffiths: A young American man who has the psychic ability to control fire.

For its North American Sega Genesis release, it was known as Ultimate QIX. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As with QIX, the goal is to carve out pieces of the playing field by drawing a box that encapsulates a certain percentage of the screen. While drawing these boxes, the player's vehicle is vulnerable to the various enemy craft patrolling the playing field. Areas within the drawn squares turn inert and are inaccessible by enemies. Once the player turns enough of the playing field inert, which is a minimum of 80% for Volfied (up from the 70% needed for QIX), the level is complete and the player earns a bonus based on how far over the minimum percentage amount they managed to achieve. Each screen has one large enemy that cannot be defeated: if the player cuts the field in half with one maneuver, the ""active"" playing field will be whichever side holds the large enemy. Smaller enemies, however, will be destroyed if they are inside the inert area.Volfied introduces small bonus pods that, once enveloped in a box, confer bonuses and power-ups to the player.

A lone space marine must infiltrate the homeworld of a hostile bio-mechanical race known as the Strogg and prevent them from invading Earth.,3030-3207,3207,0,1997-12-09,https://www.giantbomb.com/quake-ii/3030-3207/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Stroggos, the central location of Quake IIQuake II is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter developed by id and published by Activision for Windows PCs on December 9, 1997.The sequel to the 1996 game Quake, Quake II foregoes the Lovecraftian story and atmosphere in favor of a hard sci-fi aesthetic (while still retaining some of its grit). It was originally planned to be an entirely unique IP, although its gameplay similarities allowed it to stick with the ""Quake"" name. Along with being more mission-based (with different types of objectives), the game includes seamless levels that allow players to travel back-and-forth between them (which are required to complete certain objectives). It also includes a harder industrial-metal CD soundtrack, most of which are from the musician Sonic Mayhem (who previously did an alternate soundtrack for Quake).The game's main campaign is set on the planet Stroggos, homeworld of the hostile bio-mechanical race known as the Strogg. In a desparate attempt to prevent the Strogg from invading Earth, the Terran Coalition of Man (TCM) stages a counter-attack against Stroggos known as ""Operation Alien Overlord"". Players take control of a lone marine (later known as ""Bitterman""), whose drop pod crash-lands away from the staging area due to an E.M.P. blast from the Stroggos planetary defense system (or ""Big Gun""). As the last remaining survivor, the marine must single-handedly destroy their way from teleporting to Earth and then eliminate their leader (codenamed ""Makron"").The game's expands on the 3D game engine used in Quake, featuring additional out-of-the-box support for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics (via OpenGL) and new rendering effects (such as different-colored lighting). The game engine, later known as id Tech 2, also revamps the modularity of the game logic by having it use module DLLs instead of using QuakeC. Along with several fan-made mods, the game's engine was used for several third-party games, including Heretic II, SiN, Kingpin: Life of Crime, Soldier of Fortune, Daikatana, and Anachronox. Its complete source code was later released as open source on December 22 2001 under the GNU General Public License, allowing for expanded source ports.Along with two licensed ""mission packs"" (The Reckoning by Xatrix and Ground Zero by Rogue), the game received two official console ports (a Nintendo 64 version by Raster Productions and a Sony PlayStation version by HammerHead), multiple third-party computer ports (for Mac OS, Linux, and the Amiga), and an obscure port for the Zeebo. Other releases include Quake II Netpack I: Extremities (which include fan-made mods and levels), Quake II: Quad Damage (which include the game, both Mission Packs, and the Netpack), Quake II: Colossus (a Linux compilation including the game and both Mission Packs), and Ultimate Quake (which include the original Quake trilogy). An enhanced port of the game was included in the Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 as a bonus disc. The game, as well as its expansions, were digitally released by id via Steam on August 3, 2007 (albeit without the original soundtrack).The game received an updated PC and Linux port by NVIDIA's Lightspeed Studios on June 6, 2019. Titled Quake II RTX, this version makes extensive use of ray-tracing technology of modern GPUs to add several new graphical effects.The game also received multiple sequels, starting with Quake III Arena. While the direct sequel switches the aesthetic yet again, Quake II's story was expanded in both Quake 4 and the spin-off Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Quake II is a fast-paced first-person shooter game similar to it predecessor. Some of the weapons from the original Quake make an appearance in Quake II (Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher) along with many new weapons (Blaster, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Railgun, Hyperblaster, and BFG10K). </div>  <div> Weapons : The single player of Quake II contains nine missions each with one primary objective and several secondary objectives that must be completed in order to complete the primary objective. Along the way there are plenty of weapons to collect and enemies to shoot. The single player focuses on action and contains no puzzles, except for having to press switches to open up new areas, and minimal backtracking.The game does include a few scripted events such as enemies running away from an imminent air strike, but these mostly consist of monster closets. The area for each mission is very large and has several sections, the game loads whenever the player reaches a different section of the area. Sections are identified by two doors in close proximity to each other, the player enters the first door and before entering the second the game loads. In addition, each section has its own separate statistics for secrets, enemies, goals, etc. </div>  <div> Enemies : WeaponDescriptionBlasterThe starting weapon in Quake II. The Blaster has infinite ammo, but has a slow rate of fire and is very weak.ShotgunThe Shotgun fires 12 pellets and does decent damage at close range. Unlike most shotguns, it can be used effectively at medium range but it useless at long ranges.Super ShotgunThe Super Shotgun fires 20 pellets and is significantly stronger than the shotgun, it fires two shells at once.Machine GunThe Machine Gun is a sub-machine gun with a good rate of fire but strong vertical recoil. Fire it in short bursts or maintain the aim until it reaches the top of its climb.Chain GunThe Chain Gun takes a few seconds to warm up but once it starts shooting it has an extremely high rate of fire and will drain the player's ammo supply very quickly. Unlike the machine gun the chain gun has no vertical climb, but is still inaccurate at long range.GrenadeThe Grenade is a simple weapon that can be thrown or used as ammo for the grenade launcher. The grenade can be cooked by holding the fire button.Grenade LauncherThe Grenade Launcher uses grenades as ammo, once fired the grenades take 3 seconds to explode or if they make contact with an enemy they will explode immediately.Rocket LauncherThe Rocket Launcher fires relatively slow moving rockets that have a large radius of splash damage making it a dangerous weapon to use at close range. Jumping while firing at the ground allows the player to rocket jump to out-of-reach areas.RailgunThe Railgun fires a depleted uranium slug at very high speeds. In the hands of an expert, it is one of the best weapons to use in multiplayer due to its accuracy and damage.HyperblasterThe Hyperblaster is an automatic weapon that fires bolts on energy in a circular pattern. The weapon has to spin down after being fired so it can't be fired again for a few seconds.BFG 10KThe BFG 10K is the most powerful weapon in Quake II, and it is a homeage to the famous BFG 9000 from Doom. When fired, it releases a large green energy ball that shoots out green lasers at nearby enemies. It consumes 50 energy cells per shot and can kill most enemies in one hit.Grapple The Grapple is a Capture the Flag only item and can be used to get to areas on the map that would otherwise be inaccessible, it is also very useful to gain high speed very quickly. </div>  <div> Campaign : Enemy (health points)DescriptionLight Guard (20)The Light Guard is the most common and weakest enemy in Quake II. It carries either a Blaster, Shotgun, or Machine Gun and has the lowest amount of health points out of all the enemies in the game. Even in large numbers, the Light Guard posses little threat to the player due to its weak attacks and low health.Barracuda Shark (50)The Barracuda Shark is a rare enemy only found in water and are usually seen travelling in packs.Enforcer (100)The Enforcer is a common enemy in the earlier levels, but in the later levels is much less common. The Enforcer attacks with its chain gun that is attached to his right arm when the player is at a distance. When up close it will attempt to melee the player with his right arm. The Enforcer's low health and slow movements makes it easy to deal with.Berzerker (240)The Berzerker has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to the player and use a melee attack. The player can easily tell if a Berzerker has spotted them because it will shot out ""Trespasser"" when it spots the player. The Berzerker is a quick enemy and its melee attack knocks the player back a long distance or can easily knock the player off of a ledge. However, the attack itself does not do a lot of damage.Gunner (175)The Gunner is a common enemy that has a machine gun on its right arm and a grenade launcher on it left. Despite its relatively low health, the Gunner is one of the deadliest enemies in the game, mostly due to its very powerful grenade launcher. It can fire 4 grenades in quick succession that do massive damage if they directly hit the player.Flyer (50)The Flyer is a small flying robot with low health, it attacks with its blaster cannons at long range and uses its wings to melee the player when up close. They are one of the most annoying enemies in the game because of their small size and the fact that they are flying, which makes them difficult to hit. However, if the player can get them up close a simple shotgun blast will kill them easily.Parasite (175)The Parasite is a four-legged dog-like enemy that attacks by launching a organic tube at the player which drains the players health. The attack is annoying because its almost impossible to dodge and does a lot of damage.Mutant (300)The Mutant is a rare enemy that only appears in two levels. Similar to the Berzerker, it has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to melee. It is more dangerous then the Berzerker due to its higher health and more damaging attacks.Brain (300)The Brain is a strange robotic enemy that appears rarely. The Brain has an energy shield on the front that protects it from damage. It has two attacks, an arm hook and releasing tentacles from its chest. Neither attack has a good range and that coupled with its extremely slow speed make it one of the easiest enemies in the game. The only problem is that its energy shield makes it a bullet sponge.Medic (300)The Medic is another rare enemy that attacks using its automatic blaster attached to its right arm. However, attacking is not its main use, the Medic is able to revive any enemy that is not gibbed.Icarus (240)A flying enemy similar to the Flyer except with a lot more health and no melee attack. The Icarus is more of an annoyance than anything, its attack does very little damage and it poses little threat to the player. However, it keeps its distance from the player making it difficult to hit.Technician (200)The technician is a robotic enemy that contains a head encased in liquid. Other than being an incredibly strange enemy, the Technician posses little threat to the player because it is slow and does very little damage.Gladiator (400)The Gladiator is an enemy with high health and a very powerful shoulder mounted Railgun. The Gladiator is one of the most dangerous enemies in the game as its Railgun does a lot of damage and is difficult to dodge and its up close melee attack also does quite a bit of damage as well.Iron Maiden (175)The Iron Maiden is an enemy with a Rocket Launcher attached to its left arm and a claw attached to its right arm that is used for melee. Its Rocket Launcher attack deals heavy damage.Tank (750)The Tank is the strongest normal enemy in Quake II. It is heavily armoured and slow moving and has three main weapons. Its first weapon is a machine gun attached to its right arm which does low damage. Its second weapon is a blaster on its left arm that fires three blasts in a row which deals high damage. Lastly, it has a shoulder mounted Rocket Launcher which fires a stream of rockets and is the Tank's deadliest attack. The Tank is a very powerful enemy and has a lot of health, but if the player can take advantage of its slow speed it is much easier to deal with. Popping in and out of cover to shoot at it with a powerful weapon such as the rocket launcher or BFG10K will keep the player from getting hit by the Tanks deadly attacks. The Tank also has a more powerful variation called the Tank Commander (not to be confused with the boss enemy of the same name). Tank Commanders have the same attacks that do the same amount of damage, the only difference is it has 1000 health points instead of 800. Tank Commanders can only be found in the games final level.Tank Commander (2500)The Tank Commander is a boss enemy that is encountered twice in Quake II. It has tank-like treads to help it move around quickly, and it has two weapons, a chain gun and a rocket launcher. Its chain gun attack is very dangerous because it can kill the player in a mater of seconds and has no start up delay. Its Rocket Launcher attack fires three rockets that do massive damage.Hornet (2000)The Hornet is the second boss enemy, encountered two times (three counting the secret level) in Quake II. It has less health than the Tank Boss, but is harder to hit because it is able to fly. Like the Tank Boss the Hornet has two attacks, a twin chain gun that does the same amount of damage as the Tank Boss' chain gun and a rocket launcher that fires four rockets rather than the three rockets the tank boss fires. The Hornet is a very tough enemy to kill and its chaingun attack is hard to dodge and does a lot of damage.Jorg (3000)The Jorg is an exoskeleton used by the leader of the Strogg, the Makron. It is tied with the Makron himself for the most hit points in the game, and is equipped with twin chain guns. The chain guns deal similar damage to that of the other two bosses, the main difference being the Jorg's chaingun lasts indefinitely while the other bosses chain guns only fire in bursts making the Jorg's chaingun more dangerous. In addition to the chain gun attack, the Makron himself will fire his BFG 10K. This attack is extremely dangerous because the beams that shoot out from a BFG 10K energy shot are extremely hard to dodge and drain the players health and armor very quickly. One BFG 10K shot can kill the player instantly or cripple them if they don't find cover quickly. When Jorg is defeated it will explode and the Makron is left exposed.The Makron (3000)The Makron is the leader of the Strogg and is fought after destroying the Makron's exoskeleton, Jorg. The Makron still has the powerful BFG 10K attack which he uses in the Jorg battle, but he also has two new attacks. The first is a blaster attack that fires 20 blaster shots, the attack does moderate damage but is easily avoided by strafing. The second is a Railgun attack very similar to that of the Gladiator. It can also be dodged by strafing, but is harder to avoid than the blaster attack. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Unlike id's previous first-person shooters, which had players progressing from level to level (with the game sometimes split into multiple ""episodes""), Quake II has the game split into multiple groups of seamless levels. This system allows players to traverse back-and-forth between levels at different points, which is sometimes required to complete objectives. The included campaign is split into the following:The first series of levels is set in a military base, in which players must reach its communication systems and establish a link to the player's command ship.BASE1 - Outer BaseBASE2 - InstallationBASE3 - Comm CenterTRAIN - Lost Station (hidden level)The second series of levels is set in a warehouse, in which players must shut down a vital supply transport.BUNK1 - Ammo DepotWARE1 - Supply StationWARE2 - WarehouseThe third series of levels is set in a security complex, in which players must shut down the computer controlling the region's security grid.JAIL1 - Main GateJAIL2 - Detention CenterJAIL3 - Security ComplexJAIL4 - Torture ChambersJAIL5 - Guard HouseSECURITY - Grid ControlThe fourth series of levels is set in nearby mines, in which players must traverse in order to reach the Strogg production facility.MINTRO - Mine EntranceMINE1 - Upper MinesMINE2 - Bore HoleMINE3 - Drilling AreaMINE4 - Lower MinesThe fifth series of levels is set in the facility that produces new Strogg from the marine's fallen allies. Players must traverse the facility and shut it down.FACT1 - Receiving CenterFACT2 - Processing PlantFACT3 - Sudden Death (hidden level)The sixth series of levels is set in a power plant close to the planetary defense system. Players must disrupt the enemy defenses by overloading its reactor (after shutting down both the coolant and waste disposal systems).POWER1 - Power PlantPOWER2 - The ReactorCOOL1 - Cooling FacilityWASTE1 - Toxic Waste DumpWASTE2 - Pumping Station 1WASTE3 - Pumping Station 2The seventh series of levels is set inside the planetary defense system itself (known as the ""Big Gun""). Players must disable it to allow the TCM to call in an air strike and demolish it.BIGGUN - Big GunThe eighth series of levels is set inside a hangar that controls the Black Hole Generator (which allows interplanetary travel for their invasion). Players must shut down the Strogg fleet, then destroy the Black Hole Generator itself, and then proceed to the Makron's palace.HANGAR1 - Outer HangarHANGAR2 - Inner HangarLAB - Research LabCOMMAND - Launch CommandSTRIKE - OutlandsSPACE - Comm Satellite (hidden level)The ninth series of levels is set inside the Makron's heavily-guarded palace. As they make their way to the Makron, they must disable the communication laser that allows the Makron to communicate with its distant armies.CITY1 - Outer CourtsCITY2 - Lower PalaceCITY3 - Upper PalaceIn the tenth and final series of levels, the players make their way to the Makron's inner sanctum and must pursue the Strogg leader to the final confrontation.BOSS1 - Inner ChamberBOSS2 - Final Showdown </div>  <div> Modifications : Like Doom and Quake, Quake II can be played in networked multiplayer both co-operatively (with players teaming up to take on the main campaign) and competitively (in arenas suited for deathmatches). </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The base game includes eight Deathmatch maps, with additional maps added as separate downloads.Q2DM1 - The EdgeQ2DM2 - Tokay's TowersQ2DM3 - The Frag PipeQ2DM4 - Lost HallwaysQ2DM5 - The PitsQ2DM6 - Lave TombQ2DM7 - The Slimy PlaceQ2DM8 - WareHouseThe studio later released three additional maps that were intended for 64-player servers, all in a single separate download:Base64 - The Strogg BaseCity64 - Courts at WarSewer64 - The Sewers of StroggosIn addition, the following map was released as a separate download:Match1 - Reckless Abandon </div>  <div> System Requirements : The v3.20 patch of Quake II includes the mod Quake II ThreeWave Capture the Flag, which brings the Capture the Flag game mode to Quake II. Based on the ThreeWave Capture mod for the original Quake, CTF is a team-based mode where two teams fight to steal the enemy's flag from their base and bring it back to theirs.The mode includes a bonus utility weapon, known as the Grapple, which serves as a grappling hook that allows new mobility options. It also adds four unique ""tech"" power-ups, which serve as a player upgrade:Power Amplifier - Increased damage.Disruptor Shield - Increased damage resistance.Time Accelerator - Increased movement speed.Auto Doc - Grants health regeneration.Only one Tech power-up can be equipped per player, and can be dropped for other players using a dedicated command.The first included version, known as CTF 1.02, includes the following batch of levels:Q2CTF1 - McKinley RevivalQ2CTF2 - Stronghold OppositionQ2CTF3 - The SmelterQ2CTF4 - OutlandsQ2CTF5 - Capture Showdownid later released three additional maps with the CTF 1.50 patch:Q2CTF6 - Borders CanyonQ2CTF7 - Boxed InQ2CTF8 - The Hangar ScenarioIn addition, the following map was released as a separate download:Q2CTF4a - Outlands II </div>  <div> Playing Quake II on modern systems : Quake II had a very active modding community which spawned a large number of total conversations, maps, player models and more. </div>  <div> External links : Perhaps the most noteworthy of Q2's mod legacy is Action Quake 2 (AQ2) which implemented a realistic setting and modern day weaponry, it also introduced bleeding and the ability to cripple enemies so that they need to bandage themselves.Some AQ2 developers later went on to develop Counter-Strike for Half-Life. </div> "

It features 321 cars and 8 tracks, all of which are fictional. The game is one of the few on the PlayStation to use the intensive ""Gouraud shading"" for polygons, which gives objects a quality of visual depth that was rarely seen in gaming at the time. It also features, for the first time in the series history, a proper two-player split screen mode. Like previous Ridge Racer installments, Ridge Racer Type 4 featured two different driving models: 'drift' and 'grip' styles.Ridge Racer Type 4 is the only Ridge Racer game to appear on Edge Magazine's 'Top 100 Games to Play Today', where it squeezed in at number one hundred. Its placement was due to it being ""home to the series‚Ä≠‚Äô ‚Ä¨finest tracks"" as well as the aforementioned Gouraud shading. Its soundtrack and drift gameplay were also praised. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The main mode in the game is the ""Grand Prix"" mode. The player here takes on the role of an unnamed racing driver who challenges the game's fictional ""Real Racing Roots '99"" series.This series is divided into three ""stages"": two qualifying races, two quarter-final races, then three semi-final races and a final race. Between these four segments, the player will either receive a brand new car or an upgrade to their current car, based on their performance across the races. In order to unlock all 321 cars featured in the game, the player will have to beat the Grand Prix mode with every combination of team, manufacturer, and qualifying position possible, plus knock out the Extra Trials that unlock after beating Grand Prix with each combination of team and manufacturer. This extreme replay value was unheard of in video games at all, let alone compared to other Ridge Racer titles in its time.Like previous games, cars in the game have one of two disciplines of handling: ""grip"" driving has the player make tight turns almost like real driving, while the series famous ""drift"" driving tasks the player with executing sharp drifts around corners. </div>  <div> Car List : The *-marked cars at the bottom are the ""supercars"" obtained by completing Extra Trials.

It was first released on the Atari Jaguar and DOS in 1995, then released on the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn two months later. The game marked the debut of the Rayman series of video games.The game was later released for the Game Boy Advance under the title of Rayman Advance. It is also available on the US and UK PlayStation Store and on the week of 7th December 2009 Rayman was released for DSiWare. </div>  <div> Story : Rayman's world during the intro sequence.Rayman lives in a peaceful world where the magical creatures and nature coexist with one another. It's not until Mister Dark, a cloaked villain claims the Great Protoon for himself and destroys the balance and harmony in Rayman's world. The electoons that orbited the Great Protoon were scattered across the land and locked in cages. It's up to Rayman to free the electoons and reclaim the Great Protoon stolen by Mister Dark so the world can live in harmony once more. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Rayman is a traditional 2D platformer that involves the player having to reach the end of each side-scrolling stage. Rayman has a health bar that can be increased from three hearts to six by collecting a special power up. If all of his health bar is depleted, Rayman will lose a life.At the beginning of the game, Rayman can't do anything besides walk and jump, but at certain points in the game he is given new abilities by Betilla the fairy. He will eventually be able to use his fists to punch at enemies, hang onto ledges and grab onto various objects, including swinging from floating loops in the air. He can also learn to fly for a short amount of time and also run when a button is held down.As Rayman explores each stage, he is able to collect small blue objects called Tings. He can offer them to the Magician, who can give Rayman access to special bonus stages. Collecting one hundred Tings will also award Rayman with an extra life.The main aim of the game is to collect every single electoon in the stages throughout the game. Every stage has six electoon cages hidden, which need to be found in order to access the final stages and the final boss battle. </div>  <div> Releases : There are many different versions and releases of Rayman. The game's development goes as far back as the Super Nintendo. Due to a shift in technological advancement, the 16-bit platforms were becoming financially unfeasable and bieng overshadowed by newer platforms, giving way for more advanced hardware. After skipping platforms such as the Sega 32X, Rayman would finally make its debut on a cartridge based system. </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Version : Story sequences were told through stills in the Jaguar version.The very first version of Rayman was released on the Atari Jaguar has several differences and features not seen in any other version of the game ranging from level design, presentation and more. For example the Moskito flying stages were shoot-em-up stages where the Moskito shot a laser from its beak to defeat enemies. While it was altered for future versions of the game, this gameplay design would later be seen in Rayman Origins years later. Story elements were told through still images and artwork but still carried the same basic plot featuring Mr. Dark and the protoons. This is also one of two versions of Rayman that features a breakout clone. During development, the game also featured artwork and sprites representinglimbs for Rayman but were cut from the final version due to technical limitations and cartridge space which became an important factor in Rayman's character design. </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Due to the failure of the Jaguar platform, Ubisoft was quick to release the game for the launch of disc based systems. Because of the additional space and longer development time, the developers were able to add in higher quality sound and CD based redbook audio for the music giving way for speech, orchestrated music and even full motion video. Levels were refined and in some cases made even harder than the original version. This version would become the base for future releases of Rayman on modern consoles and handhelds. The MS-DOS version also saw various re-releases usually bundled with a level designer. The Playstation 1 version is currently available for purchase for Playstation 3, Portable and Vita systems through the Playstation Store. </div> "

Players take control of Rayman, a limbless hero whose main attack is shooting his fists and energy balls at his opponents. This is the first Rayman game to be made in 3D. Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers. </div>  <div> Plot : On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs. </div>  <div> Characters : Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience. </div>  <div> Releases : Rayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly.  </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution) : Globox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special ‚Äòrain-dance‚Äô.  </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Following the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game. Murfy can be summoned by the player standing on his corresponding tile.  </div> "

The game was rebuilt from the ground up to take advantage of the new technologies available on the GameCube at the time, featuring new and improved graphics, new gameplay elements, voice acting, script, in-game locations, and music. Shinji Mikami was quoted as stating that the remake is ''70% different'' than the original.To account for the game's size and image quality, Resident Evil comes in 2 discs, with two thirds of the main game situated on the first disc, and the final third on the second.A screenshot taken from the 2002 remake of the same corridorWhile originally exclusive to the GameCube, Resident Evil was eventually ported to the Wii on June 23rd, 2009 as Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil, which included the option to play with the Wii Remote and fitted the game onto one disc instead of across two.In August 2014, Capcom announced an HD port of the Resident Evil GCN remake with a new control option for PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC.In October 2018, Capcom announced a Nintendo Switch version of the game for release sometime in 2019. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Jill Valentine doing battle against a Hunter.Resident Evil plays much like every other Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, mixing in third-person combat, exploration, and puzzles. Though like most survival horror titles, Resident Evil limits the player character's capabilities beyond the norm and ammunition for their firearms is generally scarce, intended to force players to use their supplies wisely and to choose flight rather than fight when possible. There are three different difficulty modes available: Easy, Normal, and Hard, with each one featuring tougher enemies and less ammunition to be found than the last.Utilising the notorious ''tank controls'', players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles. Characters also cannot move and fire their weapons at the same time, and instead the character will 'perch' themselves to the ground when aiming. And while the camera angle perspective sometimes tends to purposely obfuscate the players view of monsters, characters will at least (by default) aim their weapon at the closest enemy when players draw their gun. What is new over the original Resident Evil is the ability to now do an 180 degree turn, which was first introduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis and has continued as a mainstay across the series since then.While the game follows a linear pattern of major events, the player is allowed to explore most of the beginning mansion at will. Many of the puzzles and necessary key items required to move on can be solved/collected in any order.The story is largely portrayed via in-game cutscenes, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next. </div>  <div> Story : Chris RedfieldLike the original, Resident Evil features two different characters--Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine--to select from. Each offers up a differing take on the same narrative, though what separates them the most is the gameplay implications, as Jill Valentine's version of the game is significantly easier and more accessible than Chris's.Jill has more inventory space to carry items; she can potentially find an additional weapon exclusive only to her story, being the grenade launcher; she has with her a lockpick that can open locked drawers; and many more such examples. However Chris is somewhat sturdier than Jill and can withstand more damage before succumbing to death, and he also has better accuracy with handguns giving players the increased chance to pop a zombie's head completely just with one shot.Jill ValentineEach character also has their own unique supporting character that they will often encounter and interact with during the game. Jill Valentine has with her fellow STARS Alpha team member Barry Burton, whereas Chris has the rookie medic of STARS Bravo team, Rebecca Chambers. Both Barry and Rebecca will sometimes have to help the player character from a perilous situation, though Barry will always be an NPC. During Chris' story, however, players may take control of Rebecca Chambers on two separate occasions to help save Chris from dying of poison, and to kill the mutated plant monster Plant 42. </div>  <div> Weapons : Chris Redfield's 6-slot inventory screenDepending on which character the player chooses, they will either have six (Chris) or eight (Jill) inventory slots in total. Each type of item requires only one slot, however. Each character also one additional slot strictly to house a unique item; Chris possesses a lighter, and Jill has a lockpick. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.All items and weapons can be examined by the player, allowing them to get a closer look and turn the object around. This can sometimes change the properties of certain key items, such as unlocking/opening a key item to reveal another inside, or may at least change the title to reflect the item's true identity. </div>  <div> Enemies : One notable feature exclusive to the remake is the addition of self-defense items. Given a separate inventory slot, there are three different self-defense items that players may find and then equip. Once one is equipped, from that point when a player is grabbed by an enemy, the player can then press the firing button which will then show the character using the self-defense item to escape the grab, canceling out any possible damage inflicted upon the character. All self-defense items are one use only, however.There are three different self-defense items, one of which can be found by both characters, and one unique item for each:Daggers - Can be found during both Chris and Jill's and will inflict moderate damage unto an enemy. There's a small chance that when the enemy has been shot, the dagger will fall onto the ground and can be collected once again by the player.Flashbang - Chris' exclusive self-defense item, Chris will shove the flashbang into the attacking enemy's mouth and, once shot by the player, will explode killing the creature completely.Taser - Jill's exclusive self-defense item, Jill will pull out the taser and then zap the enemy doing a high amount of damage. It will kill a zombie outright, though sturdier enemies such as hunters can sometimes manage to survive the current. </div>  <div> Boss Battles : A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine - The character is in good health.Caution - The character is roughly at half health.Danger - The character is approaching death.Poison - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. Whence the characters starts holding onto their hip, that is a sign that their health is at least in the Caution state, or may even be poisoned.Carrying the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, though they only have the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three herb types, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will not restore any health.Red Herb - On its own does nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character by roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% of health and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% of health and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely including poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing. </div>  <div> Unlockables : Like every other main Resident Evil game pre-Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil requires that players find one of the many typewriters located throughout the environments to save, and must also have at least one ink ribbon item in their character's inventory. </div>  <div> HD Remastered Port : One of the two main playable characters, Chris is the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team point-man, and is an exceptionally skilled marksman having won trophies for his skills with handguns. Having also served in the US Air Force before his time with S.T.A.R.S., Chris has some experience with combat. However, none of any such prior encounters could have prepared him for the nightmare he is about to endure.Voiced by Joe Whyte. </div>  <div> Development : The second of two main playable characters, Jill is the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team's machinery expert. Couple her expertise handling such tools with her experience as apart of the US Army's Delta Force training program (specialising in bomb disposal) despite only being 23 years old, Jill has managed to gather an already impressive array of skills.Voiced by Heidi Anderson.Modeled after Julia Voth. </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : One of the oldest and most experienced S.T.A.R.S. members, Barry is apart of Alpha team and is also the unit's weapons specialist.

This version was released 18 months after the original and featured some new elements. The major feature added was the game mode, Arrange Game, in which the main quest items and weapons are moved around, with a few additional alterations. Such notable differences include the corpse of Forest Speyer reanimating as a zombie, and for crows to burst through the window where the player would first notice the helipad.Main characters Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, and Rebecca Chambers were fitted into different costumes for the Arranged Mode, and would come equipped with a custom Beretta M9 handgun. It had a faster firing rate than the original beretta and has a chance to score a critical hit, which in the case of a zombie would completely destroy the head.The Director's Cut edition had two discs, with one being a full demo of the upcoming sequel,  Resident Evil 2, that  Capcom had to delay at the time. The main purpose of the Director's Cut edition was in fact to tide fans over due to the rather large delay. This version of the game hit America in September of 1997, and had a slightly different cover shot. In 1998 the ""Greatest Hits"" version of Resident Evil: Director's Cut released at a discounted price and featured completely brand new cover art, with a bloody faced zombie looking over his shoulder.The Dualshock version of the Director's Cut included a completely new soundtrack -- one that was more theatrical than the original's. </div> "

It follows in the footsteps of the 2002 Resident Evil remake which itself did a lot of restructuring with the original Resident Evil.Resident Evil 2 sees student Claire Redfield and rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy reach Raccoon City just as it is being overrun by a horde of citizens infected by the T-Virus, turning them into ravenous zombies and other monstrous creatures. Both have their own routes through the city as they attempt to escape the infestation, occasionally intersecting and meeting with one another. Depending on the order the player chooses to play the two stories, a character's second route (""Route B"") will be different than if the player had selected that person first (their ""Route A"") due to actions the player may have made as the first character chosen. Thus, the player can either follow Leon A/Claire B or Claire A/Leon B. </div>  <div> Development : Demand for a remaking of Resident Evil 2 has existed ever since the original 1996 Resident Evil was remade from the ground up for the GameCube in 2002. However the remake's poor sales cut short any possibility of Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3: Nemesis receiving such treatment; the poor sales is also what ultimately lead to the series adopting a more action-orientated focus with Resident Evil 4.As the series continued onward, the cries for an RE2 remake went unabated. In 2012, Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated that they would consider remaking Resident Evil 2 if there was enough demand from fans. Though despite this claim, it would take until 2014 for any further hints of the possibility of an RE2 remake to surface. On August 5th, 2014, a remastering of the original remake was announced for PS4, PS3, 360, XB1, and PC. Within the same timeframe was a listing of a ''Resident Evil 2 HD'' being briefly shown up on Amazon.com for a release date of September 29th, 2015. Capcom offered no such comment to the listing.'Biohazard 2: New Rebirth Project'On July 30th, 2015, a member of Capcom's R&D division took to Facebook to inquire interest about an RE2 remake and what ''the brand is all about'', while also expressing concern with the fan-remake that was in development, titled ''Resident Evil 2 Reborn''. Another developer calling himself ''H'' then took to Facebook, providing an update about how his bosses perceive the idea of an RE2 remake.On July 31st, ''H'' posts again, now showing off the logo for an official Biohazard 2 (Japanese title for Resident Evil) remake document and how he was planning on bringing it to his higher ups. Finally, on August 12th, 2015, ''H'' revealed himself to be Capcom producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi and officially confirmed the development of a Resident Evil 2 remake via a YouTube video.When the original director of Resident Evil 2, Hideki Kamiya, was asked in an interview about wanting to work on an RE2 remake, he said no. He further explained that he prefers working on action games and doesn't actually enjoy horror, that he gets scared too easily. </div> "
Resident Evil 3: Nemesis,Capcom,Capcom,"November 10, 1999",ps,"In the third installment of the survival horror series, Jill Valentine must escape the zombie-infected Raccoon City while being hunted down by a genetically-engineered monster called Nemesis.",3030-5587,5587,0,1999-09-22,https://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-3-nemesis/3030-5587/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : The titular antagonist, NemesisTaking place once again in the zombie infested town of Raccoon City, Resident Evil 3 follows Jill Valentine as she tries to escape the oncoming hordes of undead monsters. The game begins one day before the events of Resident Evil 2, eventually surpassing them and extending into the day after.This time the player finds themselves traversing a substantial portion of Raccoon City itself while also taking a few short trips to locales made famous from RE2, such as the R.P.D. (Raccoon Police Station). Throughout the game, Jill is hunted by the Umbrella corporation's latest B.O.W., and title character, Nemesis. Similarly to the T-103 in RE2, the Nemesis will appear at scripted occasions during the story and will relentlessly try to kill Jill Valentine. Unlike the T-103, Nemesis can follow Jill through rooms and sometimes even comes equipped with his own unique Rocket Launcher. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Jill at the hands of NemesisResident Evil 3 largely plays much like its predecessors Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and is split between a mixture of combating B.O.W.s, exploration and puzzles. Fitted with the notorious 'tank controls' the series became known for, players move via a third person perspective throughout a number of pre-determined camera angles.Players are also forced to stay stuck on the spot when attempting to use their weapons, though auto-aim is turned on by default, so the character will at least aim automatically at whichever enemy is closest -- even if it's located outside of the player's own perspective. Climbing up/down stairs is now performed manually, allowing the player and even zombies to walk up/down staircases at their own pace. Furthermore, Resident Evil 3 is the first to include the 180 degree turn, which allows the player character to instantaneously turn around by simultaneously pressing down and the 'run' button.Another new mechanic is that of a dodge maneuver. By hitting the R1 or R2 buttons (Default PS1 controls), or by holding the R1 or R2 button then hitting the X button right before an attack, Jill will dodge out of the way. If the character is equipped with a pistol and should also escape via a roll, Jill will go onto one knee which'll give her a temporary boost to her fire-rate with her handgun. However whichever dodge animation the character would use is random.There exists some destructible objects throughout the game which can help the player in fending off enemies. Such examples include explosive barrels or a loose crane box.The story is largely portrayed via cutscenes, both in-game and CG, however there are also a number of Files (diaries, memos ect.) players can collect. These will often provide additional insight into the goings on across the overall narrative, but some are more vital as they will provide information pertaining to solving puzzles or maybe hinting as to where to go next.Encountering differing enemies across multiple playthroughs was introduced in Resident Evil 3 to add a sense of unpredictability. Where a player may have faced a pack of zombie hounds in a particular area, during another playthrough may then find a group of Beta Hunters there instead. A select few encounters with Nemesis are randomized as well. </div>  <div> Story : Resident Evil 3 only stars one selectable character, being Jill Valentine. Though there will also be a short portion of the story where players will temporarily take control of UBCS soldier, Carlos Oliveira. Carlos functions exactly like Jill, though he does have at least one unique weapon that Jill cannot collect -- two if playing on Hard mode, being his SIGPRO handgun and M4A1 assault rifle.On one specific occasion when fighting Nemesis in either a restaurant or News Office, Carlos may provide assistance as a friendly NPC. He will use his M4A1 assault rifle, but only on its Manual mode setting, giving it a three-shot burst fire. Carlos can also die during this fight, which will result in a game over, however he is significantly more durable than the player during this fight.While not playable from a story context, fellow UBCS soldiers Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef are playable in the unlockable Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal minigame, as detailed further below. </div>  <div> Weapons : Like Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 3 offers up two distinct difficulty settings, 'Easy' and 'Hard', with no in-between. The differences are significantly more drastic than between the 'Rookie' and 'Normal' modes in RE2, however. In Easy mode, players start off with an M4A1 Assault Rifle (which is otherwise inaccessible besides as an unlockable in Hard mode), and located within the first inventory box players find in the Warehouse save room is a hefty selection of the game's weaponry, with a large portion of spare ammunition to go along with them. The player's default inventory is also increased from the eight slots in Hard mode to ten (eventually maximising at twelve during the story), which functions across both the main game and the unlockable Mercenaries minigame.When playing on Easy Mode, however, players cannot acquire the Nemesis briefcase awards for beating him, and the Mine Thrower weapon is removed entirely. </div>  <div> Enemies : Inventory screen, with the character's health up top.All characters across the game feature the same inventory space of either eight slots or ten, depending on the difficulty as mentioned above. Besides the character's inventory, there also exist a number of item boxes where players can store unwanted items. Item boxes are often located within save rooms (though not always) and items will persist throughout all item boxes across the game.When switching between playing as Jill and Carlos in the story, the item boxes will not carry over any items. </div>  <div> Live Selection : A character's health can be seen via the inventory menu, with an Electrocardiograph Machine showing a character's status. The different statuses are:Fine (green) - The character is in good health.Caution (yellow) - The character is roughly at half health.Caution (orange) - The character is roughly at a quarter of health.Danger (red) - The character is approaching death.Poison (purple) - The character is poisoned and their health will slowly deplete.Besides the EKG, players may also note the character's stance. If a character is in the Caution zone, they'll hold their chest, but move at the same speed as if they were perfectly fine. On the other hand if they're in the Danger zone they'll hold their chest and limp, moving incredibly slower than before.Carrying on the tradition set by the original Resident Evil, characters use a small variety of herbs to heal themselves and cure poisons. First Aid Sprays are also available, with the singular purpose of healing the character fully. There exist three types of herbs, all of which can be combined in some way for different degrees of healing:Green Herb - On its own will restore 25% of health.Blue Herb - On its own will cure poison, though will no restore any health.Red Herb - On its own can do nothing.Green + Green Herb - Mixed will now heal roughly 50% of health.Green + Green + Green Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 25% and cure any poison.Green + Green + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character 50% and cure any poison.Green + Red Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, though not of any poisons.Green + Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will heal the character completely, including Poisons.Red + Blue Herb - Mixed will do nothing. </div>  <div> Unlockables : During key moments in the game, Jill will be faced with a ''Live Selection''. These sequences temporarily stall the action and allow the player to decide how they'd like to react to a situation from two possible choices. More often than not these are based around Nemesis encounters. As time still progresses, albeit slowly, in these instances, the player is faced with the added pressure of a timer. If the player doesn't choose quickly enough, a decision will be made for them -- usually inflicting damage upon Jill in the process.A more detailed listing of the choices and their effects can be found further below. </div>  <div> Versions : Gunpowder can now be collected in order for Jill to create her own ammo. This allows for the creation of different types of ammo that would not be available otherwise.There are three individual types of gunpowder in Resident Evil 3; types A and B are found throughout the game and the only way obtain type C is by combining one pot of type A and B. By combining these gun powders with either the Reloading tool or standard grenade rounds, various types of ammunition can be created.By combining the same kind of gun powder repeatedly with the Reloading tool you can create advanced ammo types for the handgun and shotgun. The number of pots used in a single combination will not affect the progression for obtaining the enhanced ammo, so in order to obtain them as quickly as possible it is best to use a single pot each time.Below is a complete breakdown for combining every type of gun powder combination with both the Reloading Tool and Grenade Rounds as well as how many combinations is necessary to unlock the enhanced ammo. Difficulty will only affect the amount of ammo created, it does not have any effect on obtaining the upgraded ammo. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Bases Results for Mixing with the Reloading toolGun Powder A: Handgun RoundsGun Powder B: Shotgun ShellsGun Powder C: Grenade RoundsGun Powder AAB: Shotgun ShellsGun Powder BBA: Handgun RoundsGun Powder AC: Flame RoundsGun Powder BC: Acid RoundsGun Powder CC: Freeze RoundsGun Powder CCC: Magnum RoundsBase Results for Mixing with Grenade RoundsA: Flame RoundsB: Acid RoundsC: Freeze Rounds </div> "

It was a capture the flag game played with four types of vehicles: tanks, armored support vehicles, helicopters and jeeps. Each side had their own base, which was defended by walls, turrets and soldiers. A player would have to invade the enemy base and find the building holding the flag, destroy it, and return with the jeep to pick up the flag and return it to their base without dying.Each vehicle was used for different purposes. The armored support vehicles were slow but heavily armored and could shoot rockets which did a great amount of damage. Tanks were faster and more agile than ASV's but were less powerful. Helicopters were powerful but had to return to their starting points to refuel or restock on ammo, and could be shot down quickly. Jeeps would be destroyed in one or two hits and were only used for picking up the flag. Jeeps could inflate their tires however, and evade tanks and ASV's over water. The game was one of the more popular games on the 3DO, and was highly associated with the system, along with Out of This World, Gex, Masters of Orion 2 and Fifa Soccer. </div>  <div> Music : The game soundtrack consisted of a number of famous classical pieces. The title screen used Verdi's ' Dies Irae' and is a dramatic orchestral and choral track from his Requiem. 'Ride of the Valyries' by Wagner (as used in the helicopter attack in the movie Apocalypse Now) kicks in when the player takes control of the helicopter. 'Flight of the Bumblebee' by Rimsky-Korsakov stars when driving the jeep and then changes to the 'William Tell Overture' by Rossini when driving with the captured flag, 'Mars' from The Planets by Holst is used when driving the tank . Finally, the Armored Support Vehicle uses Greig's 'In the Hall of the Mountain King' as it's musical accompaniment. </div>  <div> Trivia : The game was featured in the Pauly Shore film In the Army Now.An add-on pack titled Maps o' Death was released for the 3DO version, that consisted of 100 additional maps for the game.A port of Return Fire was completed for the Sega Saturn, but was not released, even though the game had gone ""gold"". </div> "

It was originally marketed towards young, female gamers in order to get them interested in role-playing games. The game is designed for beginner RPG players and is notorious for its fully voiced musical numbers, where the characters would break out into song at certain points in the story. Rhapsody is the first game in the MƒÅru ≈åkoku no Ningy≈ç Hime (Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom) series and is the only entry from the series to be released in the U.S. </div>  <div> Story : Rhapsody revolves around a teenaged girl named Cornet Espoire, who has the mysterious ability to communicate with puppets, and also has a magical horn that grants her wishes whenever she plays it. Cornet dreams of meeting her ‚Äúprince charming‚Äù and falling in love with him. She‚Äôs joined by Kururu, a fairy puppet who acts as a guardian angel for Cornet and often ridicules her for her behavior as per use of her large paper fan.One day, Cornet is gathering inotium (a valuable resource and the currency of the game) in the nearby woods for her grandfather, Mustaki. She encounters a strange girl named Myao who tries to steal Cornet‚Äôs inotium. Myao leads an army of cat soldiers who attack Cornet, but she easily defeats. Myao then summons a fierce dragon to attack Cornet, but it‚Äôs quickly slain by a mysterious young man who resembles the same person in Cornet‚Äôs dream. The man introduces himself as Prince Ferdinand. Cornet is so love struck that she is unable to mutter any words. Humiliated by this defeat, Myao escapes to report back to her family of this incident. Myao‚Äôs family includes the voluptuous witch and leader, Marjoly, the dog-like Gao, the crow-like Crowdia, and herself who resembles a cat. Enraged by this act, Marjoly plots to attack the kingdom.Meanwhile, Cornet realizes the prince saved her and decides to meet the prince by entering the Miss Marl‚Äôs Kingdom Beauty Contest. Cornet encounters her rival Etoile Rosenqueen, who is more elegant than Cornet, but is also spoiled rich and enjoys mocking Cornet for her less fortunate upbringing. Learning that Etoile has bought out all of the clothing shops‚Äô dresses, Cornet searches the nearby theater for a costume. As per Kururu‚Äôs suggestion, Cornet wears a giant stuffed bear as her costume. The beauty contest consists of: physical challenge round where the participants will battle each other, a costume round where the participants display their costumes, and a talent round. The contest ends in a tie between Cornet and Etoile and as a reward, both are invited to the prince‚Äôs birthday ball where they will dance with the prince.At the prince‚Äôs ball, it‚Äôs here that Cornet and Ferdinand realize they‚Äôre both meant for each other, but the intimate moment is ruined when Marjoly and her gang crash the party. Marjoly notices Ferdinand‚Äôs handsome looks and attempts to cast a love spell on him, but ends up turning him to stone by mistake. Marjoly then kidnaps Ferdinand and takes him back to her lair, a floating fortress called Beauty Castle.A wise sage named Polansky tells Cornet that in order to rescue Ferdinand and break the curse, Cornet must collect the five Heart Stones: Fire Stone, Thunder Stone, Wind Stone, Water Stone and Earth Stone.As Cornet travels around the world to collect the stones, she‚Äôll visit the village of frog people called KeroKero, a sunken ship, a volcano, an ice tower, and even get swallowed whole by a giant earthworm and team up with Etoile in order to escape. Throughout these travels, Cornet will also encounter and fight the different Marjoly sisters who are after the stones as well.Upon collecting all of the stones, Kururu passes out from what appears to be a fever and is taken to Polansky. Polansky uses his magic in order to let Cornet and Etoile enter Kururu‚Äôs dreams where she revisits a memory and learns the truth behind the accident that killed her mother several years ago. Cornet‚Äôs mother, Cherie, has special powers much like Cornet, but is much stronger. In the dream, Cornet and Etoile see their younger selves and Etoile refuses to recognize that the snot-nosed child version of herself is actually her. The two witness child Cornet and child Etoile playing with each other. The children decide to play near the church graveyard where child Cornet stumbles into the secret passageway below the graveyard. Child Etoile informs Cherie of what happened and together Cherie, Cornet, Etoile, and child Etoile go after child Cornet. When they find young Cornet, they see her crying near the remains of the Ancient Weapon that was used in the war several years ago. It‚Äôs then revealed that the royal minister Golonzo is attempting to reactivate the Ancient Weapon in order to take over the world. Child Cornet is trapped in the middle and in order to protect her and stop Golonzo, Cherie sacrifices herself to block the Ancient Weapon‚Äôs attack. Cherie‚Äôs true form is then revealed as a beautiful angel from ancient times that is said to be responsible for creating the puppets that Cornet uses. Weakened by her sacrifice, Cherie transfers her soul to the inanimate puppet Kururu that Cornet always brings with her and uses this form to watch over and protect Cornet. After Cornet returns from the dream, Polansky admits to Cornet that the Heart Stones are actually needed to teleport Marjoly‚Äôs lair, Beauty Castle, and that only the kiss of Ferdinand‚Äôs true love can restore him to his former self. Cornet leaves Kururu in Polansky‚Äôs care and heads off to Cape Hope to activate the portal to Beauty Castle.Once Cornet enters Beauty Castle, she makes her way to the throne room where Marjoly, Crowdia, Gao, and Myao are waiting for her. Cornet fights and defeats Marjoly and just as Marjoly bluffs that she wasn‚Äôt using her full power and prepares to power up, Golonzo breaks in through the back wall with the completely restored Ancient Weapon. It‚Äôs revealed that Golonzo was working for Marjoly, but in reality he was just using her resources to rebuild the Ancient Weapon and plots to take over the world. Marjoly quickly defeats the Ancient Weapon, and just as she‚Äôs about to finish it off, her spell fails. Kururu appears and gives Cornet the extra encouragement that allows her to finish off the Ancient Weapon. After defeating the Ancient Weapon, Cornet approaches the petrified prince and kisses him, thus, breaking the curse. Marjoly acknowledges this act of love and lets them go.The story concludes with Cornet and Ferdinand getting married and the entire cast celebrates the wedding, including the Marjoly family. During the celebration, Cornet heads outside to the castle balcony where Kururu/Cherie bids her farewell to Cornet. Cherie announces her job was to ensure Cornet‚Äôs happiness and now that‚Äôs been completed she leaves Kururu‚Äôs body and ascends to heaven. Cornet picks up the inanimate Kururu puppet and is joined by the prince as the credits roll.After the credits roll, a bit of dialogue between what is assumed to be Cornet and Ferdinand reveals Cornet is pregnant with their first child. Cornet believes it will be a girl that will be named Kururu. The name isn‚Äôt mentioned in the game, but is evidenced because the game‚Äôs sequel, Little Princess: Marl Oukoku no Ningyou Hime 2, stars Cornet‚Äôs daughter, Kururu. </div>  <div> Characters : At certain points in the story, the characters will break out into song that is related to the current situation. These instances are scripted and the topics for these songs range from Cornet daydreaming about the prince, to frogs singing about their homeland, to pirates singing about lotion. In the U.S. PlayStation version, players have the option to hear the vocals in either English or Japanese. The DS version, however, only featured the Japanese version because there were localization issues with the English version. After viewing these scenes in the story, they can be replayed from the gallery on the main menu. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Cornet Espoire ‚Äì A girl who has the magical ability to communicate with puppets and bring them to life with her horn. She dreams of meeting the prince of her dreams.Kururu ‚Äì A fairy puppet who is Cornet‚Äôs best friend and acts as her guardian angel. She is mischievous and often ridicules Cornet for her absent-mindedness. The story reveals that she hosts the soul of Cherie, Cornet‚Äôs mother.Mustaki ‚Äì Cornet‚Äôs grandfather and only living relative. He is a master craftsman of puppets and repairs any broken puppets that Cornet brings to him. He has a history with Polansky in developing the Ancient Weapon back in the Great War. They both saw this weapon as something that could be dangerous if used with the wrong hands and decided to destroy it.Prince Ferdinand E. Marl ‚Äì Prince of Marl‚Äôs Kingdom, enjoys hunting and practicing his swordplay. Many women dream of marrying him, and he appears to rescue Cornet when she was in danger. He is turned to stone and kidnapped by Marjoly.Etoile Rosenqueen ‚Äì Cornet‚Äôs rival and spoiled rich. She and Cornet were childhood fans, but she got older, she became obsessed with her wealth. Despite her regal appearance, she also packs heavy artillery and is always accompanied by her two bodyguards.Marjoly ‚Äì An evil, dim-witted witch who is said to be more than 1,000 years old, but retains her youthful appearance with the aid of magic spells and copious amounts of make-up. She leads her family of sisters who often mock her for her age. She falls in love with Ferdinand and tries cast a love spell on him, but turns him to stone by accident and is kidnapped by her.Crowdia ‚Äì A beautiful warrior who sports large black wings and is part of the Marjoly family. She fights with swords.Gao ‚Äì A boyish-looking female that has a dog tail and is part of the Marjoly family. She fights with her fists.Myao ‚Äì A child-like witch who has cat ears and is part of the Marjoly family. She is able to summon monsters.Golonzo ‚Äì The royal minister and well-known pervert.

He tells Cornet to collect the five Heart Stones in order to activate the portal to Marjoly‚Äôs lair and to save the prince.Cherie ‚Äì Cornet‚Äôs mother who died in an accident several years ago. She had magical powers like Cornet. A dream sequence reveals the circumstances that led to her death and revealed her to be a powerful angel from ancient times. She transferred her soul to the puppet Kururu in order to watch over Cornet. </div>  <div> Puppets : The gameplay between the two versions is identical, with the major difference being in the combat. Outside of combat, the game plays like a very simple RPG. Traveling to different areas is done through a map select screen. The towns are filled with NPC villagers and puppets that talk to Cornet, as well as shops. There are no weapon or armor shops as the only equipment you can change are accessories. Cornet and her puppet team can each equip up to three accessories at a time. The accessories grant bonuses to attack, defense, speed, magic and so on. In addition to accessories, shops also carry recovery items.The dungeon areas of the game consist of simple maze environments that are filled with treasure chests and random encounters. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The battle system in the PlayStation version of Rhapsody is a SRPG like what is found in Final Fantasy Tactics and would be the basis for Nippon Ichi‚Äôs later work, Disgaea. The DS version of Rhapsody uses a more traditional turn-based system like what is Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy.In both versions, however, each party member has the same set of commands: attack, magic, defend, and item. The PlayStation version has the additional move command for moving your units. In both versions, Cornet has the unique command where she can play her horn in battle to buff her party members. Each time Cornet plays her horn, a music note appears at the top of the screen. When enough music notes have been acquired, Cornet can use her ‚Äúpresent‚Äù command where she unleashes several food-themed attacks; the more music notes you have, the more powerful attacks you can use. These attacks range from the weak candy attack to the powerful gigantic stack of pancakes attack. Each combatant also has an element attached to them in battle. The elements are: fire, water, earth, wind, dark, and holy. Each pair of elements counter each other (i.e. fire and water, earth and wind, dark and holy).In the PlayStation version, Kururu appears in battle as an aesthetic element and has no impact in battle. In the DS version, however, Kururu is fully playable as one of Cornet‚Äôs puppets and is in fact, very powerful. When Kururu is out of commission as a result of the plot, she is unable to participate in battle. </div>  <div> Reception : Over the course of the story, Cornet will encounter several puppets. Some of which will join her party fight for her. Cornet can have up to three puppets actively participate in battle, while the others are put into reserve. Some puppets will join Cornet as part of the story, while others must be found in dungeons and may even test Cornet‚Äôs combat abilities before agreeing to join her. In the PlayStation version, certain monsters could also join Cornet's party as puppets.When a puppet joins Cornet‚Äôs party, they also have a related sidequest for you to complete. These quests vary from recruiting all of the puppets from a certain set such as the three egg brothers, or witnessing a specific event that is related to a puppet. </div>  <div> Sequels and Connections to Other Franchises : Sharte ‚Äì the first puppet you meet (besides Kururu) is searching for her lost sister.Terra- Sharte‚Äôs sister.Kid ‚Äì The youngest egg brotherTell ‚Äì The middle egg brotherBilly ‚Äì The oldest egg brotherFlare ‚Äì A newborn dragonL-Kun ‚Äì A large stuffed bear that Cornet uses as her costume for the Miss Marl‚Äôs Kingdom Beauty ContestLedgem ‚Äì A mysterious creature that has a connection to PolanskyKoro ‚Äì Cornet‚Äôs neighbor‚Äôs dog that recently died, but is resurrected by Cornet as a puppet.Chiba ‚Äì A samurai puppet, one of the Mustaki warriors who have a history with Cornet‚Äôs grandfather.Duke ‚Äì A knight puppet, one of the Mustaki warriors who have a history with Cornet‚Äôs grandfather.Albatross ‚Äì A commando puppet that wields a large rocket launcher, one of the Mustaki warriors who have a history with Cornet‚Äôs grandfather.Knightspawn ‚Äì A corrupted knight.Michael ‚Äì A frog from Frogburg, is killed for breaking into the castle in order to meet his lover Caroline.

It also features a finishing move system similar to the Mortal Kombat series and includes a unique system for choosing player colors (where all combatants use few colors and players slowly cycle through the color tint).The game's story diverts from the original game's ending, with the game's protagonist (the combat cyborg ""Coton"") failing in his mission and instead being assimilated by the nanomorph Supervisor (who uses fragments of his consciousness to improve herself and her robot army). Electrocorp decides to release their own computer virus to counter the Supervisor's, causing the Supervisor's minions to malfunction and wage war on each-other. While the Supervisor's robot army causes chaos in the Electrocorp facility, Coton himself uploads his consciousness to another robot to continue his mission.Similar to the previous game, advertising material hyped in-game music by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). While most of the game's soundtrack is also done in-house, the game's theme (""Cyborg"") was composed for the game by May. This song was later included in his 1998 album Another World.The PC version was later re-released as Rise 2: Resurrection - Director's Cut in September 1996, updating the game to add two additional hidden characters and additional backgrounds while including various goodies on a bonus CD (including a making-of video). </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes 18 playable characters from the start, a boss character, and 10 hidden opponents (some of which can be unlocked with a cheat code).

Several students from each of the targeted schools investigate who is behind it.It was later ported to the Sony PlayStation worldwide in 1998 (July 30 in Japan, September 30 in North America). Along with the secrets unlocked and two additional characters, this version includes a second disc, the Evolution Disc, which adds several bonus mini-games and new features. This version was later digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network (both for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable) in Japan on February 13, 2012.The game later received a Japan-exclusive update for the PlayStation, titled Shiritsu Justice Gakuen: Nekketsu Seisyun Nikki 2, that expands on some of the new features from the Evolution Disc while adding two new playable characters. It also received a full-fledged sequel on arcades and the Dreamcast, named Project Justice. Some of the characters also make appearances in other games, such as Kyosuke in Capcom vs. SNK 2 and Batsu in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Rival Schools is a four button fighting game; there are two buttons for punching (light and heavy) and two buttons for kicking (light and heavy). The player selects two characters as a team and fights other teams of two (with the exception of the boss characters). Matches are fought one-on-one, however, if the player's vigor (super meter) is high enough they can call their partner in for a Team Up attack which can be executed by pressing both light or heavy attack buttons at the same time. Team Up attacks would involve both characters of a team attacking their opponent, or in some cases, the partner would replenish the main character's health or vigor.In between rounds, the player can choose which member of their team they would like to use in the next round; they can keep their main character in play or switch to their partner. The Vigor meter is similar to the super meter in the  Street Fighter Alpha series; Vigor can be gained by deal or absorbing damage during a match. Team Up attacks would use 2 levels of vigor and an individual character's special move would cost 1 level of vigor. The combo system in Rival Schools is similar to that of  Marvel vs Capcom in that each character has a simple launching attack that allows for air combos. </div>  <div> Characters/Schools : The arcade version of the game includes 14 playable characters (and two unplayable boss characters) from the start, split into five High Schools. During the first few weeks of each arcade board's playtime, players can only pick two characters in the same High School. After that (or if the arcade operator enters a special operator code), players could pick any combination of characters (which removes the game's story cutscenes if both are in a different High School).After the Free Select mode is activated, waiting an additional week (or through another operator code) unlocks the two boss characters for play. After that, waiting another week (or through yet another operator code) unlocks both a hidden character (Sakura from the Street Fighter Alpha series) and an alternate outfit for Akira.The arcade version included with the PS1 port unlocks the Free Select mode and all characters from the start, adding two new characters (Hayato and Daigo). The Evolution Disc version also adds unlockable alternate outfits and custom characters (or pre-made characters in the international versions). </div>  <div> Evolution Disc : A standard small-scale academy for carefree students.

Riven: The Sequel to Myst,Sunsoft,Acclaim,"November 30, 1997",ps,"The follow-up to the landmark adventure game Myst continues the story of Atrus and his quest to rescue his imprisoned wife Catherine from a deteriorating Age ruled by Gehn, Atrus' megalomaniacal father.",3030-16230,16230,0,1997-10-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/riven-the-sequel-to-myst/3030-16230/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Bridge approach from Boiler Island to Temple Island's ""Super Dome""Riven: The Sequel to Myst is a puzzle adventure game developed by Cyan Worlds and originally published by Red Orb Entertainment in 1997 as the direct sequel to the highly successful Myst.Development of Riven took place over more than three years, and the game's scope expanded due to a much larger budget and development team when compared with Myst's. Former Industrial Light & Magic employee Richard Vander Wende also joined Cyan Worlds for the project, lending his own unique aesthetic style to Riven in an effort to visually differentiate the game from the environments of Myst.The game's initial release consisted of five CD-ROMs which were swapped during transitions between certain areas of the game. Due to their relatively limited storage capacity, several discs were necessary to contain the large amount of streaming video integrated into Riven's various scenes. Riven was later released on a single DVD-ROM with enhanced visuals, which also eliminated the necessity to swap discs.Riven was a commercial success, becoming the highest-selling game in 1997 despite its late October release; the game went on to sell roughly 1.5 million copies in the first year after its initial release. Although generally well-received by critics, Riven also garnered some negative criticism in regards to its aging presentation and mechanics, which were largely identical to those of its 1993 predecessor Myst, as well as the obtuse nature of some of its puzzles. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like Myst before it, Riven is a first-person point-and-click adventure game set across several pre-rendered environments. Players explore the world of Riven by clicking on different areas of the screen in order to turn, walk, and interact with objects in the environment. Progress is technically non-linear and, aside from sparse conversations with a handful of non-playable characters, completely player-driven. The game does not track any gameplay objectives, requiring players to explore the five islands of Riven with little guidance in order to solve puzzles and eventually arrive at one of a number of possible endings.As with its predecessor, Riven also includes a ‚ÄúZip Mode‚Äù for fast transitions through previously explored areas. </div>  <div> Story : Riven received praise for its distinctive visual aestheticsThe events of Riven directly follow Myst's canonical ending in which the player (unofficially known as ""The Stranger"") frees Atrus from an imprisonment which had been orchestrated by his two scheming sons, Sirrus and Achenar. After dealing with his corrupt children, Atrus requests the player's assistance in rescuing his wife Catherine, who had been tricked by their children into returning to her home Age of Riven.Much like Atrus, Catherine became trapped due to the absence of a functional linking book in Riven that would allow her to return to Myst Island. She was eventually captured by Gehn, the megalomanical father of Atrus and original author of the ""Fifth Age"" of Riven.Thirty years prior to the events of the first game, Atrus was forced to link to Riven by his domineering father and fell in love with a Rivenese native named ""Katran"". Together, they managed to escape from Gehn's tyranny by trapping him inside his own slowly collapsing Age of Riven. Much of the backstory of these three characters is detailed in the Myst franchise's first tie-in novel, Myst: The Book of Atrus.In the thirty years since Atrus and Catherine fled from Riven, Gehn has presented himself as a deity to the Age's indigenous and superstitious inhabitants. He now rules Riven using a combination of fear and his own knowledge of the fallen D'ni empire, including the lost D'ni Art of writing linking books. However, Gehn's grasp of the written Art is highly flawed, and he has long sought to create a functional linking book to free himself from the confines of his deteriorating Age by exploiting its available natural and human resources. Gehn's ruthlessness has also given rise to a resistance movement known as the ""Moiety"", who seek to free all Rivenese from his rule even as their world degrades due to the flaws inherent in Gehn's D'ni writing style.At the beginning of the game, Atrus hands the player his journal, explaining that it will be sufficient to bring the player up to speed on his history with Gehn, Catherine and Riven. He also provides the player with a ""trap book"" similar to those which had been used to ensnare Sirrus and Achenar, with the intention of luring Gehn into it. Because Atrus is preoccupied with rewriting sections of the Riven book in order to delay the Age's destruction, he cannot accompany the player to Riven himself. Atrus is also unwilling to risk Gehn escaping from Riven and admits that the player must link to Riven without any means of returning to Myst.Thus, the player must find a way to signal Atrus once they have trapped Gehn and freed Catherine; afterward, Atrus plans to travel to Riven with a genuine Myst linking book in order to retrieve his wife and the player before the doomed Age collapses completely. Before the player links to Riven, Atrus also reveals the possibility that their success may allow the Stranger to finally return to Earth. </div>  <div> Ports and Re-releases : There are three primary goals that the player must accomplish in order to reach the game's ""good"" ending: trap Gehn inside the false linking book, rescue Catherine from her prison and discover a method to signal Atrus. Signaling Atrus before rescuing Catherine and trapping Gehn will lead to one of the game's several ""bad"" endings.Gehn's telescope at the sealed Star FissureDuring the course of the game, the player will discover the sealed Star Fissure, a tear in the fabric of Riven's reality that purportedly leads back to the Stranger‚Äôs point of origin on Earth. In fact, this is the same fissure mentioned by Atrus in the first game's opening narrative, revealing how the Myst linking book originally fell into the Stranger‚Äôs possession on Earth. In the game's canon ending, the Stranger is able to trick Gehn into using the trap book, thus capturing him and allowing the Stranger to free Catherine from her island prison. Afterwards, the Stranger reopens the Star Fissure to signal Atrus, triggering a cataclysmic event leading to Riven's imminent collapse.Atrus immediately links to Riven with another linking book in hand before reuniting with Catherine. She explains that after Gehn had been eliminated, Riven's inhabitants were able to escape to the Moiety rebels' secret Age of Tay.Atrus and Catherine thank the Stranger for all of their help, and Atrus informs them that by jumping into the Star Fissure, the Stranger should be able to safely return home. The couple link back to their home on Myst Island, ensuring that their linking book falls into the Fissure afterward. The Stranger then falls into the starry expanse, presumably returning to the location on Earth from where they had first linked to Myst as depicted in the original game's opening sequence. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : In addition to the original releases for PC and Mac, Riven was also released on the Sega Saturn, the Sony PlayStation, and the Pocket PC. Riven is currently available for sale through digital storefronts GOG.com and Steam, and a mobile port of Riven is available on Apple iOS mobile devices through the App Store. </div> "

The combat structuring and look of the game are unmistakable, and instead of a class system Koei has implemented character transformations called Werechanges. Interestingly, the Were receive their own experience and level-ups separately from the characters they spawn from. Different strategies must be used to overcome the perils that lie within the varied landscapes and mission objectives.

This version later received a smaller limited-release update in 1998, known as San Francisco Rush the Rock: Wave Net, which added online multiplayer via Wave Net.The Alcatraz Edition of the game was later ported to Windows PCs by Karma Entertainment, released exclusively with some video cards. It was also ported to the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, and PC as part of the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition compilations. Unlike most games in those compilations, the version of this game is a recreation and has some noticable differences.The game later received a Nintendo 64 sequel (Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA), an arcade sequel (San Francisco Rush 2049), and a reboot (L.A. Rush). </div>  <div> Tracks : The original game included three tracks: Beginner, Advanced, and Extreme.

They were later added back into the arcade version with the Rush the Rock update.The Rock - Known as the hidden ""Track 7"" in the N64 version.Downtown (Advanced) - Known as ""Track 4"" in the N64 version.The Heights (Extreme) - Known as ""Track 5"" in the N64 version.Sunset (Extreme) - Known as ""Track 6"" in the N64 version.The PS1 version only includes the original three tracks along with one new exclusive track (Track 4). </div> "

After battling their way through 7 stages Scooby defeats the Phantom Virus who congratulates Scooby and Shaggy but taunts that the game is not over yet. Luckily for the pair, Fred and Daphne arrive with the anti-virus software Fred realised was on his communication device all along and use it to defeat the virus once and for all. With the evil threat gone, as the game ends Fred asks Shaggy and Scooby if they still wanted their own game to which Scooby responses enthusiastically 'Uh, huh'. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game has 21 levels spread out across 7 stages, in which you find clues, explore different locales such as a mine, and other places from the direct-to-video film.

It was developed and published by Acclaim, well know at the time for the Turok series, which also was a comic adaptation. </div>  <div> Story : In the game, players take on the role of Michael LeRoi, a voodoo warrior with supernatural powers. His objective is to stop Legion, a demon from Deadside (where all dead souls go). A demon who asked a serial killer in the 1800 to design a castle in Deadside called Asylum, a place where all killers, thieves, rapists and evil souls could reside. Legion intends to use this structure to build his armies and invade Liveside, the land of the living.In order for Legion to get this serial killer to help, he had to convince him to commit suicide so he could follow him to Deadside. The game takes place in 1999. Many years after the first serial killer was recruited by Legion. By this time, 4 more serial killers have been recruited, and are know as The Five. The Five are Milton Pike, Marco Cruz, Avery Marx, John G. Pierce/Jack The Ripper (who was the architect of Asylum), and Victor Batrachian, who is acting as the leader of The five. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As Shadow Man, players can travel between Liveside and Deadside. They do so obviously by using a teddy bear as a medium that connects Michael LeRoi to his little brother's dead soul that, of course, is in Deadside. Later on in the game players can use the teddy bear to teleport to places they have already been.The game has LeRoi explore different worlds in search of 120 dark souls. These are needed by Legion to create an immortal army, thus, Shadow Man's objective becomes to get them before Legion does and to stop his plan of invading Liveside, eliminating The Five in the process. As players gain more souls, LeRoi becomes more powerful and can access new areas, meaning the game requires players to do some backtracking.Shadow Man faces different monsters throughout the game and in order defeat them, players will have to make use different weapons. Normal weapons from Liveside like shotguns and handguns, and Deadside weapons like the Shadowgun.Other than different weapons and items, LeRoi also finds reports about the serial killers and other game related events that expand the story beyond what you see in the cutscences. These can then accessed from the item menu.Shadow Man gives players the option to face The Five in any order they want and allows them to go the different worlds (if the players has enough souls) in any order without affecting the story.A Playstation 2 exclusive sequel called Shadow Man: 2econd Coming was released in 2002. </div> "

Sheep,Minds-Eye Productions,"Empire InteractivePAL,NA, SyscomJP","November 6, 2000",ps,An isometric real-time strategy-puzzle game where players try to herd a flock of sheep past numerous obstacles. It features a bizarre plot involving alien sheep.,3030-6672,6672,0,2000-11-06,https://www.giantbomb.com/sheep/3030-6672/,," <div> Overview : Sheep is a comedic 3D isometric real-time strategy-puzzle game developed by Minds-Eye and published by Empire for the Sony PlayStation and PC in both North America and Europe on November 2000.Players control one of four characters (humans BoPeep and Adam Halfpint, regular dog Motley, and anthropomorphic dog Shep) as they herd semi-autonomous sheep through each level while avoiding deadly obstacles. The PS1 version also supports local two-player multiplayer, where each player herds their team of sheep to push a soccer ball at the opposing player's goal.The premise of the game is that sheep were once intelligent alien beings that became stranded on Earth and left to become domesticated by mankind. Now in the modern day, their ancestors have come to retrieve them (by abducting the main characters to help herd as many of them as they can to Mount Mouflon).Along with a Japanese PS1 release (by Syscom in June 14, 2001), it was also ported to the Mac (released exclusively in North America by Feral on July 2001) and was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network as a PSOne Classics title in both Europe (on August 14, 2008) and Japan (by GungHo on April 25, 2012).The game also received a handheld port by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance in April-May 2002. Published by Capcom in Japan (as Hitsuji no Kimochi, which loosely translates to ""A Feeling of Sheep"") and by Empire overseas, this port strips all of the bizarre comedic elements while adding a new cutesy art style (with a new playable cast of sheep dogs) and a new ""arranged"" mode (where players level up both their sheep and herder). </div>  <div> Gameplay : When starting the game players must choose either easy, medium or hard difficulty and at the start of each level players can choose a herder: Adam Halfpint, BoPeep, Motley or Shep and a breed of sheep: Pastoral, Factoral, Longwool or Neogenetic.Herding sheep in Sheep involves simply running behind them at which point they will start moving in the opposite direction, however they can be highly sensitive to the herder's movements and odd sheep will often stray from the flock. Herders also have a shout to make the sheep quickly scatter in the opposite direction and can pick up and throw individual sheep. The object of each level is to guide the sheep to the end under a time limit, avoiding the obstacles that can kill them along the way. If all of the sheep in a single level die or the time runs out the player fails the level.The sheep themselves have the ability to jump over certain obstacles, stand on switches and knock down impassable bails of hay but levels often also contain cattle grids which only the herder can pass across. Occasionally additional sheep in need of rescue can be found within a level and each level also contains a golden sheep. If the player manages to collect all the golden sheep in a single world they will unlock a sheep-theme minigame at the end of that world. At the end of each level players are scored on how many sheep they saved, how much time was left on the clock when the level finished and bonus points (which can be earned through getting sheep to eat carrots, knock down scarecrows etc.), players also receive an additional bonus if they have safely rescued all of the sheep in the level. Various powerups throughout the game such as a radio which will make sheep follow the player can also be found. </div> "

Silent Hill,Konami,Konami,"January 31, 1999",ps,Everyman Harry Mason searches the desolate town of Silent Hill for his missing daughter in the first of a series of survival horror titles that rely more on unsettling atmosphere than jump scares for tension.,3030-4312,4312,0,1999-01-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/silent-hill/3030-4312/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Silent Hill's ""Otherworld""Silent Hill is a third-person survival horror game developed by Team Silent and originally published by Konami for PlayStation in 1999. Set in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill, the game follows author Harry Mason as he searches for his missing daughter and unravels the small town's darkest secrets along the way. Unlike prior survival horror titles such as Resident Evil, Silent Hill shifts its focus away from jump scares and ""B movie"" elements to emphasize the game's foreboding atmosphere and psychological horror aspects. The original Silent Hill was a critical and commercial success and went on to spawn a long-running game franchise, as well as a film adaptation released in 2006. It was re-released via PlayStation Network (for PS3, PSP, and PS Vita) in North America in 2009 and in Europe in 2011.A reboot/reimagining of the original Silent Hill titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories was released for Wii, PS2, and PSP in December 2009. While the reimagined game's plot is different, Shattered Memories retains the familiar cast of characters seen in the original Silent Hill. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Silent Hill uses the survival horror template popularized by the Resident Evil franchise for its basic gameplay; players must keep Harry Mason alive through a series of hostile environments by making effective use of limited resources such as ammunition and healing items. Harry must also solve puzzles and defeat several boss characters to progress through the game's story, which is mostly presented through both in-engine and pre-rendered cutscenes. </div>  <div> Story : Players use tank controls to maneuver Harry from a third-person perspective as he explores the town of Silent Hill; however, the game's environments are modeled in full polygonal 3D as opposed to the pre-rendered backgrounds which were more common among its contemporaries in the genre. Thanks to its 3D engine, the player also has limited camera control and can press L2 in most areas to reorient the camera angle towards the direction Harry is currently facing. Like many later PlayStation titles, Silent Hill also supports the DualShock controller's left analog thumbstick for character movement.Taking aim at an ""Air Screamer""Holding the Square button while moving allows Harry to run; he will become short of breath after sprinting for an extended duration, but this has no effect on gameplay. Harry can side-step left and right with L1 and R1 or perform a quick 180-degree turn by pressing both buttons at once. Pressing Down and Square simultaneously causes Harry to hop backwards a short distance, which can be useful for dodging certain enemy attacks. The X button examines objects of interest near Harry, including items and weapons that can be picked up and stored in the player's inventory; this button also allows Harry to kick damaged and prone enemies in order to finish them off.If Harry has a weapon equipped, holding R2 readies the weapon and (if auto-aim is enabled) locks-on to the closest nearby enemy, after which pressing X will execute an attack. As a civilian with no formal combat training, Harry's accuracy with firearms is far from flawless and he will sometimes miss his targets. The player's ability to accurately shoot enemies is affected by several factors, such as visibility and whether Harry is moving or standing still.The Circle button is used both to cancel out of menus and to toggle the flashlight in Harry's chest pocket on or off. Although being able to see in dark areas is obviously important, keeping the flashlight turned off minimizes enemies' awareness of Harry, potentially allowing players to avoid unwanted encounters with stealth. Once the map of a particular area has been acquired, pressing Triangle allows players to view that area's map. Finally, the Select button opens Harry's inventory, while the Start button pauses the game. Silent Hill's default controls can be reconfigured in the Options menu. </div>  <div> Setting : Harry Mason""The fear of blood tends to create fear for the flesh.""-Silent Hill's opening FMVSilent Hill begins with an introductory full-motion video presented in the style of a television series' opening credits. The video displays various scenes and characters that appear over the course of the game; these are intercut with shots of author Harry Mason and his young daughter Cheryl as they travel by car along a dark and winding hillside road towards the small town of Silent Hill, Cheryl's favorite vacation spot.As Cheryl naps in the car's passenger seat, Harry notices a police motorcycle unit driven by a female officer as it overtakes and passes his car. A few minutes later, Harry spots the officer's motorcycle abandoned along the road. After catching a sideways glance at the bike, Harry turns forward just in time to see the figure of a young woman step into the middle of the road and directly into the path of his car. Harry frantically swerves to avoid her, causing his vehicle to spin out before careening off the road and down the hillside. </div>  <div> Development & Re-Releases : Some time later, Harry awakens inside his crashed car with the passenger door ajar and Cheryl nowhere to be seen. Collecting himself, Harry exits the vehicle and stumbles out into the foggy streets of Silent Hill to find his daughter. He immediately notices that snow is falling out of season and that the town itself appears to be completely abandoned. Following the sound of footsteps, Harry spots Cheryl through the fog and calls out to her, but she fails to respond and runs off into a residential alley. A confused Harry pursues Cheryl into the alleyway as the town suddenly turns very dark, forcing him to strike a match for light. His immediate surroundings soon become twisted and hellish as he winds between segments of rusted barb-wire fence caked with gore and what appear to be human remains. Realizing that he and his daughter are in grave danger, Harry tries to escape the alley only to be set upon by a group of diminutive knife-wielding creatures that trap him and repeatedly slash his flesh until Harry succumbs to his wounds.Cybil BennettThe next scene shows Harry awakening inside a diner from what appears to have been a nightmare. Also present in the diner is the female police officer Harry saw earlier on the road, who approaches Harry and questions him about what he knows regarding Silent Hill's current bizarre state. After Harry pleads his ignorance as a simple tourist, the woman introduces herself as Cybil Bennett, a patrol officer stationed in the nearby town of Brahms. Harry asks Cybil about his missing daughter, but unfortunately Harry is the only other person Cybil has encountered within Silent Hill. She also confirms that all telephone lines in town are dead and even radios appear to be non-functional, prompting her to return to Brahms for additional reinforcements. Cybil warns Harry to stay indoors for his own safety, but he refuses to leave Cheryl alone to fend for herself. The officer lends Harry one of her service pistols for protection before leaving the diner, promising to return to Silent Hill with help as soon as possible.Before heading out into the streets himself, Harry hears unusual static emanating from a pocket radio sitting on one of the diner's tables. When he approaches the radio, the windows suddenly shatter and a human-sized flying creature swoops inside to attack Harry, who manages to kill the abomination with his new handgun. Recognizing a link between the monster's presence and the sound of static, Harry grabs the radio along with a few other useful items before striking out to find Cheryl.Map of Old Silent HillHarry first decides to check the residential alley from his ""dream"" for possible leads on Cheryl's whereabouts. More hostile creatures roam Silent Hill's fog-shrouded streets, requiring Harry to avoid or kill the monsters as he makes his way north to the alley. Here he discovers Cheryl's sketchbook and the words ""To School"" scrawled upon one of its pages. Consulting a town map he acquired at the diner, Harry concludes Cheryl has traveled to nearby Midwich Elementary School. He soon discovers the road leading south towards the school is inaccessible except by passing through one particular townhouse on Levin Street; however, its back door is secured by three peculiar locks which can only be opened with three keys scattered around the ""Old Silent Hill"" district of town.Harry locates each of the three ""Keys for Eclipse"" by referring to a marked map pinned to the townhouse's wall and exits through the dwelling's rear door, only to witness Silent Hill once again suddenly grow very dark. Making sparing use of his flashlight, Harry picks his way through the monster-infested darkness and finally reaches the school. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Midwich Elementary's pitch-dark interior offers little respite for Harry as he searches its classrooms, which are occupied by the same unsettling ""Grey Children"" that attacked Harry earlier in his dream. After solving the school's resident puzzles, Harry retrieves two medallions that open the doors of a clock tower located in the school's courtyard. He descends a ladder inside leading to an underground tunnel, where he climbs a second ladder on the opposite side leading back above ground. After emerging from the clock tower's basement, Harry finds himself seemingly back in the school's courtyard during a rain shower. However, he soon notices a strange circular symbol inscribed on the ground that wasn't present before.Reentering the school hallways confirms Harry's suspicions: just as in his dream, he has somehow crossed into an ""alternate"" Midwich Elementary that has been twisted into a rusted and blood-spattered nightmare version of itself, complete with deadlier insect-like enemies. Though he is disoriented by the strange-yet-familiar area, Harry weaves through the reality-bending hallways of the alternate school and eventually encounters a ringing telephone. Lifting the receiver, Harry briefly hears Cheryl's panicked voice on the other end before the line goes dead. He steels his resolve and presses ahead before finally reaching the school's boiler room; here he fights the Split Head, a large man-eating creature resembling a lizard. Once the monster has been dispatched, Harry suddenly finds himself back inside the ""normal"" school's boiler room, where he catches a brief glimpse of the young woman he saw during his car accident before she vanishes like a ghost.Dahlia GillespieStill no closer to finding his daughter, Harry exits the school and hears a ringing church bell. He decides to follow the sound of the bell to its source at the nearby Balkan Church, where he is greeted by a strange-looking middle-aged woman named Dahlia Gillespie. Dahlia claims his arrival was foretold and asks Harry if he wants to find ""the girl"". After dispensing some very cryptic advice, Dahlia hands over a pyramid-shaped artifact she refers to as the ""Flauros,"" telling Harry to ""make haste to the hospital"" before exiting the church herself. Though he is perplexed by Dahlia's words, Harry is able to reach Silent Hill's central shopping district by using a key to the drawbridge leading east across the river.Several humanoid monsters shadow Harry as he explores Central Silent Hill, including its police station; based on some case files found inside the station, it becomes clear the local police had been investigating an illegal drug operation in town involving a hallucinogenic plant known as ""White Claudia,"" as well as the recent mysterious death of an officer. Directly south of the police station, Harry enters the front gate of Alchemilla Hospital, his next destination. </div>  <div> Trivia : Harry scarcely steps foot into the hospital's foyer before hearing a gunshot ring out from very close by. Following the source of the noise, Harry enters an adjacent room and discovers a man dressed in a business suit, who is holding a revolver and sitting over the fresh corpse of an ""air screamer"" creature. The man raises his gun and fires a warning shot in Harry's direction, but Harry's panicked reaction manages to convince the man that he is not a threat.Dr. KaufmannThe man introduces himself as Dr. Michael Kaufmann but claims he knows nothing about the current state of Silent Hill, explaining that he was asleep when the town's population suddenly disappeared. Harry once again inquires about his daughter, but Kaufmann only remarks on her slim chances for survival in such a dangerous place. After apologizing for his callousness, the doctor asks Harry if his wife also accompanied him to Silent Hill, prompting Harry to mention that his wife Jodie passed away four years prior. Kaufmann leaves Harry alone inside the examination room shortly afterward, stating that he ""can't just sit around here doing nothing.""The hospital's interior appears relatively safe as Harry begins investigating its ground floor. Inside the hospital director's office, a strange red liquid can be found splattered on the floor among several shards of glass; this substance can optionally be gathered into an empty water bottle from the hospital's kitchen and serves an important purpose later in the game. By locating the key to the basement, Harry gains access to the hospital's backup generator, which re-enables the elevators; unfortunately, the main hallway doors on both the second and third floors are barred. However, as Harry prepares to exit the building, a button labeled ""4F"" suddenly appears on the elevator's control panel. Harry presses the button, and after a moment the elevator doors open to reveal the dark alternate version of Alchemilla Hospital.Winding through the mouldering hallways of the decrepit building, Harry is attacked by shambling hospital staff members sporting strange, twitching growths on their backs. Gathering four colored plates scattered throughout the hospital allows Harry to enter the second floor's operating room and retrieve a key, which unlocks the storeroom in the basement. Inside the storeroom, a secret door behind a cabinet leads to a hidden sub-basement, where Harry discovers a patient room that appears to have seen recent use. Here he finds a photograph of a girl resembling the ghostly young woman last encountered in the school's boiler room, with the name ""Alessa"" written in the corner. Harry can optionally obtain a mysterious videotape in one of the sub-basement's other rooms, which can be viewed with a VCR on the third floor; however, the image is obscured by static and he can only make out a few disjointed words in the tape's audio.Lisa GarlandA key in Alessa's room opens the first floor's examination room. Upon entering, Harry finds a woman cowering underneath a table. Crawling from her hiding place, she immediately embraces Harry before introducing herself as Lisa Garland, one of the hospital's resident nurses. Just like Kaufmann, Lisa claims to have been unconscious when the town's population vanished and offers no leads on Harry's missing daughter. Harry asks Lisa about the hospital's hidden sub-basement, but she only remarks that the staff were under strict orders never to enter the basement storeroom. During their conversation, a sudden severe headache causes Harry to black out as a concerned Lisa tries to help him.After regaining consciousness, Harry finds himself alone inside the normal hospital's exam room, but he is soon met once again by Dahlia. She speaks of Silent Hill being ""devoured by darkness"" and tells Harry to seek the town's ""other church"" while handing over a green key. Dahlia also identifies the strange symbol seen in the school's courtyard as the ""mark of Samael"" and implores Harry not to let it be completed before abruptly exiting the room. </div> "
Silhouette Mirage,Treasure,Working Designs,"January 5, 2000",ps,"A run-and-gun platformer developed by Treasure and released for Saturn and PlayStation. Help Shyna defeat the two opposing factions of Silhouette and Mirage, using the powers of both. ",3030-19485,19485,0,1997-09-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/silhouette-mirage/3030-19485/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Silhouette Mirage is a run-and-gun action platformer originally released on the Sega Saturn in 1997 and then ported to the Sony PlayStation the following year. The PlayStation port lacks some of the graphics of the original but makes up for it with a few bonus boss battles. The PlayStation version was also the only one to see a localization (from Working Designs) and was later made available via the PSOne Classics range for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. The Working Designs port made further alterations to the gameplay also, increasing the difficulty.The story of Silhouette Mirage concerns a post-apocalyptic warzone where Shyna Nera Shyna, an artificial being created by the supercomputer Gehena, must help unite this fractured world by defeating two factions: Silhouette, and Mirage. From there, Gehena can start working on uniting the two disparate halves of these two factions into their correct wholes. Standing in her way are Hal and Megido, the two faction leaders, and another being like her called Zohar who is fought several times during the story.  </div>  <div> Gameplay :  Shyna has the powers of both Silhouette and Mirage, but can only switch ""polarity"" when she turns around: when facing left, she turns blue and can use Silhouette attacks; when facing right, she turns red and can use Mirage attacks. She can also switch these polarities at any time, but it costs some of her spirit gauge. Most enemies are only weak to their opposing element, so the player has to maneuver themselves to a position from which they can take them out. if the player damages an enemy with their own element, they instead take spirit gauge damage: this won't kill them, but it will reduce the damage they do with their attacks (and this elemental health/spirit damage system applies to Shyna as well).The game uses a combination of platforming and shooting for its stages, with a few melee options also. One useful melee skill is the ""Cash Bash,"" where Shyna will literally shake down enemies for additional funds. Shyna can spend this money at merchants, found most places, to upgrade her weapons or buy healing consumables. Shyna can also use a ""Reflector"" shield to reflect enemy projectiles back to their casters.   </div> "

A Windows playable version, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995. SimCity 2000 was also ported to many consoles, ranging from the SNES to the GBA, and is also available on PSN.What a city!SimCity 2000 adds many features that were missing from the original. With new tools in transportation, zoning, and infrastructure, as well as a isometric view and a smoother UI, SimCity 2000 gives players more freedom than the original SimCity to create cities. With no real goal, the game instead directs players by consequence, being given a set of tools and set loose on a dynamic play area. Given enough money, the player can use the tools in any way they want, but if their cities are not generating income, the money will soon run dry. Players will find that to function, cities need utilities, civic services, transport infrastructure, and a fragile balance between homes and jobs. Playing within (and sometimes outside) the limits of the rules and seeing what works is part of the game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In SimCity 2000, the player starts off with a randomly generated piece of land, which could be terraformed to their liking. The player then builds a city, providing it with necessary utilities and civic structures. They also need to balance their budget, their income coming from rent and taxes, and their expenditure from building and maintaining the city. If they run below a certain budget deficit, they will be kicked out of the mayor's office, losing the game.Undeveloped ZonesThere are 3 main types of buildings in SimCity 2000: Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI). They are not built by the player directly. Instead, the player ""zones"" certain plots of land for specific development. Zones are the main type development in any city in the SimCity franchise, and what grows in those zones are determined by the amounts of utilities and services that plot can receive, and the land value of the area. Players can also zone landfills, air and seaports, and military bases. These zones are not as affected by land value as RCI zones but they will drastically affect their surrounding areas negatively.Land value is an important factor in SimCity 2000, and can be raised or lowered by the presence or absence of water features, trees, and pollution. It can also be affected presence or absence of civic structures, power and water supply, and good transport infrastructure. Rewards, special buildings given to the player for reaching certain population milestones, also help to boost land value of the area. </div>  <div> Expansions : Arcologies are special futuristic buildings, rewarded to players once they reach a city population of 120,000 and they are after the year that they are invented. There are 4 arcologies in SimCity 2000: Plymouth Arco, Forest Arco, Darco, and the Launch Arco. Arcologies provide the city with a huge boost in population, the smallest one (Forest Arco) providing 30,000 residents, and the mighty Launch Arco giving a massive 60,000 residents.Launch Arcos also have a special effect. After building 300 Launch Arcos, a special message ""The exodus has begun."" will appear, and the they will ""launch"" (in reality, just explode). The player will then be compensated for the construction costs after all the Launch Arcos have been launched. This only occurs in the PC and Mac versions of the game. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Disasters will hamper a player's construction of their cities (unless they turned it off). These disasters are random, and range from mundane (a fire), to the extreme (monster invasions). Players can also activate these disasters purposely to destroy their cities for fun. There are 8 disasters in the game:Fire: An inferno blazes through the city. Fire stations help put it out.Flood: Waters flood into the city. Dispatch emergency services to limit floods.Air Crash: A plane crashes into the city and starts fires.Tornado: A rampaging tornado rips up trees and buildings.Earthquake: An earthquake destroys both buildings and underground infrastructure.Monster: A giant sphere with an huge eye descends on the city, and sets things on fire with its laser beams.Hurricane: A hurricane destroys buildings and cause flooding.Rioters: Unhappy Sims protest on the streets and start fires. Police presence helps to limit rioting. </div> "

The game was based on a kid's cartoon show which aired for 13 episodes on CBS in 1993-1994. Both the game and the tv show were quite unpopular and performed poorly commercially. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay is split into two distinct parts, the side-scrolling levels, and the driving levels, with the former making up the bulk of the game. The driving levels are interspersed throughout the game, there being only 5 of them altogether, and involve Lightstar climbing onto his hovering motorcycle, ""The Light Skybike"", and riding it through the valleys of the planet Lumimaire, avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies along the way with the energy from his sword. The side-scrolling levels however involve Lightstar simply battling his way through an environment, the game lacked any puzzle mechanics and was simply straight-up combat, Lightstar would collect power-ups along the way allowing him to use new abilities, in a similar vein to Contra, Lightstar could collect power-ups that would enable his sword to shoot the equivalent of homing missiles, burst fire, spread shot, etc.The game featured 20 levels in total and boasted the presence of 100 different enemies, there were several enemy types including of course the eponymous skeletons, along with killer plants, birds, bats, dogs, and some other animals. Each of the enemy types had different attacks along with varying strengths and weaknesses. For example the armored skeleton warriors were strong against the prince's sword, however would be instantly killed from a missile attack. Mastery of this 'strengths and weaknesses' aspect of the game was vital to succeed as it had a harsh difficulty level, this being one of the major criticisms of the game upon release. </div>  <div> Story : The game is set on the planet of Lumimaire where two opposing forces, the Legion of Light, and the Skeleton Legion, led by Baron Dark, fight for control of the Lightstar Crystal, an ancient and magical crystal that is vital to the survival of the planet but is also rumored to provide unlimited power to its holder. The Legion of Light, led by the hero Prince Justin Lightstar, along with his allies Talyn, Grimskull, and Ursak, spend their lives defending the crystal and trying to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. However, at the opening of the game, it is revealed that Baron Dark has managed to steal half of the crystal, turning him into an undead skeleton and granting him control of a great army of skeleton warriors, which he intends to use to attack the city of Luminicity in order to gain control of the other half of the crystal.The game then begins with players taking control of Prince Lightstar, who has to battles his way through the armies of Baron Dark.

Skullmonkeys,"The Neverhood, Inc.","DreamWorks InteractiveNA, Electronic ArtsPAL, River Hill SoftwareJP","January 31, 1998",ps,"Skullmonkeys is a 2D platforming game in which Klaymen, fresh off defeating the evil Klogg, is taken to Planet Idznak to stop Klogg's plans once and for all.",3030-8992,8992,0,1998-01-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/skullmonkeys/3030-8992/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Careening through space from his defeat in  The Neverhood,  Klogg eventually lands on Planet Idznak, which is populated by generally-dimwitted creatures called Skullmonkeys. He quickly disguises himself as one of them, is shortly-thereafter named their leader, and begins using them in his plan to create Evil Engine Number Nine. Jerrio, the sole intelligent Skullmonkey, sees this and sends out a call for help in the form of a winged suit, which attaches itself to  Klaymen and flies him over to Idznak. Klaymen is initially confused by his predicament, but eventually receives a communique from Jerrio that explains the situation midway through the game. </div>  <div> Aesthetics :   SkullmonkeysThe game is entirely shot with stop-motion animation, mainly made up of malleable clay models, but occasionally diverging into live-action territory (such as with the boss Joe-Head-Joe, whose torso is made up of the head of an actual person).After every few worlds, the player is treated to an animated  FMV interlude. Sometimes these interludes connect with the plot, other times they act as funny and engaging skits to keep the player motivated throughout his or her journey.Skullmonkeys's soundtrack was composed by  Terry S. Taylor, and continues the Neverhood tradition of music with a wide variety of instruments and nonsense vocals. The soundtrack is fully available on his two-disc compilation, Imaginarium: Songs from the Neverhood. </div>  <div> Mechanics : Skullmonkeys is a fast-paced  two-dimensional platformer. Players take control of Klaymen as he progresses toward the goal of each stage. Klaymen is piloted through traditional platformer controls (walking, running, jumping on enemies' heads to kill them), but with a few twists:Klaymen has a gun, with which he fires a limited supply of pellets. Homing pellets are sometimes available.Klaymen shortly gains the ability to ""phart"" out clones made of gas. Players can use these clones to progress through the level without fear of losing a life; if the clone reaches the end of the level, he automatically becomes the real Klaymen.If he collects 100 clay balls, he gets an  extra life.If he collects a halo, he can withstand an extra hit from enemies.If he collects a pink orb, he can grow huge and destroy all enemies onscreen.If he collects a  Willie Trombone head, he can make Willie's head pop out of his chest -- causing all items to gravitate toward him.If he bumps into a  hamster, three hamsters immediately surround him and shield him from damage.In some later levels, he gains a yellow bird that allows him to glide.If he collects three swirls throughout a level, he can choose to go to a ""bonus room"" at the end of each level, during which he's serenaded by  an encouraging acoustic guitar song.If he collects three 1970s tokens throughout the entire game, he can go back to a bonus room that takes place in the 1970s.There are also occasional levels where Klaymen must pilot a vehicle (The Amazing Drivy Finn/The Incredible Drivy Runn), each with their own mechanics. The Drivy Finn is piloted via a top-down interface, where Klaymen must carefully move it through the underwater level without hitting mines; the Drivy Runn is an  autoscrolling level where Klaymen simply makes the vehicle jump to avoid spikes/collect bonuses.The player is taken through the game's ninety levels one-after-the-other, with no navigable  world map and no way to replay previous levels for bonuses. Additionally, Skullmonkeys has often been given negative marks for featuring a password system in place of a memory save. This, combined with the game's notorious difficulty, has made the ending difficult to come across. </div>  <div> Levels : Skullmonkeys has 90 levels split up into 17 worlds:Science CenterMonkey ShrinesHard Boiler SnoElevated Structure of TerrorSkullmonkeys' Brand HotdogsYNT WeedsYNT EggsYNT MinesYNT Death Garden Monk RushmoreShardsSoar HeadWorm GraveyardThe Incredible Drivy RunnCastle De Los MuertosEvil Engine No. 9Skullmonkeys has five  bosses: Shriney Guard, Joe-Head-Joe, Glenn Yntis, Monkey Mage, and  Klogg. </div> "

God of Smith, Hephaestus, spoke to the light which surrounded her. ""You are the one who freed him from the demon's sword. For this I am grateful"". The ray of light grew small, so did her sword, armor & shield. So small now they fit in the palm of her hand. Magically the light shaped to form the gods of Athena, Ares, Nike and all who protected her. Feeling the presence of a holy power, she fell to one knee and lowered her head.

She reached Soul-Edge in excitement and joy for this was to be the sword of salvation. But holding the sword did not bring joy, but only an emptiness she had not yet known. With great effort she tried to carry the weight of SoulEdge on one shoulder. But it was too heavy and she fell to the ground in an ungainly sprawl.

From the rage of battle he knew not if this blood was his or his opponents. Though this be certain, his opponent lay fallen in front of him with SoulEdge in hand. Exhausted he slowly reached for SoulEdge, but his hands gathered only thin air. Weak from the blood of battle in his eyes Li Long spoke the name of his dearest love. ""Chi...e, Chie!""

One long month had passed since Li Long left in search of Chie. So long was it that she knew he failed. His journey could only have ended in death. Her eyes were filled with tears. One half year later, Chie learned she would bear the child of Li Long. Saddened by her loneliness she cried, ""Oh dearest, please watch over our child"".VoldoVoldo's ending.So much time had he spent in search of the sword. Now his journey was completen With the sword now his, he can finally rest his weary soul. Joy is but a cloudy memory of a long time ago. But this purpose is clear, he knows what the Master Vercci would have done. With this thoght he cheek against the cold blade of SoulEdge. Upon his return, Voldo placed SoulEdge ina place of honor along with other such treasures. He now felt at peace with a restfulness long overdue. Fulfilling the wish of his deceased master made his heart swell with pride. Buried deep underground was the Emperor's seat, lavishly decorated in gold & precious jewels. It had long belonged to the Master Vercci. Woe was he, for he was a soldier with no battle to fight. It was time he had now as he his memories of Master Vercci. Voldo knew others would soon come for the sword.CervantesCervantes' ending.Cervantes restored freedom from the disgraceful domination of the evil sword. He became a real owner of Soul Edge. ""Hoist the sails, anchors away, prepare for departure! I will mold the world into my vision of paradise!!"" His words echoed in the vast emptiness. Suddenly, incredible scenes filled the void. Responding to Cervantes's commands there appeared the mighty fleet, prepared to strike terror into the world with total devastation. And now, the fleet was slowly making headway with there sails well taut by dreadful musky wind... </div> "

It revolutionized the game industry and has become a pop culture icon.",3030-5099,5099,0,1978-06-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/space-invaders/3030-5099/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game‚Äôs development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) versionGameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player‚Äôs task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or ‚Äúbunkers‚Äù near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a ‚Äúmystery ship‚Äù will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus. </div>  <div> Development : While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinetDue to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game‚Äôs original title, Space Monsters. </div>  <div> Impact and Legacy : Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins‚Äîand subsequent production increase‚Äîin Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 versionThe 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first ""killer app"" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as ""the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time."" Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the ""Top 10 Most Influential Games"" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of ""The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,"" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which ""were attempts to simulate already-existing things,"" Space Invaders was ""the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else."" In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a ‚Äúhigh score,‚Äù and was the first to save the player‚Äôs score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari‚Äôs Asteroids, Williams‚Äô Defender, and Namco‚Äôs Galaxian series.It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a ""seminal arcade classic"", IGN listed it as the number eight ""classic shoot 'em up"". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry. </div> "

Many of them give Spider-Man certain different abilities. All of the costumes from the previous game are also included in Enter Electro.The gameplay and design of Enter Electro follow the same path as the previous game, one of the main differences including playing at ground level. In the prior game, if a player swung too low, they would be engulfed by a poison yellow mist and fall to their death. Unlike that game however, Enter Electro presented itself as city level streets, that were shown in an almost grid like form, as opposed to fee roaming from the last game.

Intervening, the thieves take off but Spider-Man quickly places a tracer on the leader's motorbike. As Spidey follows them to a warehouse, he finds himself in a warehouse where he takes out all the thugs, saving the leader for last who he then interrogates. The thug tells Spidey where his boss, The Shocker, is, and Spider-Man takes off to battle Shocker. Defeating him, the Shocker mentions an airfield and on his way to the airfield, Spider-Man helps contain a bomb scare. When he finally reaches the airfield, Spider-Man sees a plane being taken off, but when he finds that the supposed pilot is unconscious, he places a tracer on an accompanying helicopter. Spider-Man frees the Pilot who manages to take control of the plane, stopping it from crashing, Spider-Man begins to chase down the helicopter to a train yard where he finds the Sandman. Fighting the Sandman and defeating him, Spidey then flees aboard a train, where he sees Beetle disapear, but not before he leaves a clue for Spidey to find.Following the clue to a Science and Industry ball, Spider-Man witnesses Hammerhead kidnapping Dr. Watts. Spider-Man fights Hammerhead, but by the time Spidey wins, he finds that Sandman has escaped with Dr. Watts in his stead. Spider-Man, out of leads, decides to investigate BioTech for clues, where he encounters the Lizard. After a brief battle, the Lizard morphs back into Dr. Curt Connors who explains to Spider-Man that the mastermind of the plot is Electro, and that he plans to steal a Bio-Nexus device and that Spider-Man should make his way to Dr. Watts' lab.Spidey arrives at the lab and finds out about the Bio-Nexus' power source, when suddenly, the Sandman appears and the two fight. Upon defeating Sandman, Spider-Man sees a news report about the Bio-Nexus' power source; a sapphire on display in a local museum called Zeus's Tear. Spidey makes his way there, finding Dr. Watts and Electro. As Spidey and Electro fight, Electro manages to grab Dr. Watts and says he will give Spider-Man Dr. Watts if Spidey gives Electro the sapphire. Spider-Man throws the sapphire but misses in an attempt to grab it again, once he has Dr. Watts but fails and Electro grabs the sapphire.Using the gem to supercharge himself, Electro becomes Hyper-Electro and flys into a conductor to charge himself up. Electro screams: ""TONIGHT, ELECTRO DANCES WITH THE GODS!""=After an extensive battle, Spider-Man defeats Electro. The game ends with Electro and his cronies in the same cell as the villains from the previous game. As Spider-Man reads the Daily Bugle, he sighs as all his work has been credited to the Mighty Thor. </div>  <div> September 11, 2001 edits : Originally, the game's final boss battle was to be set atop of the World Trade Centre, but the events of Sept. 11, 2001 resulted in the game being pulled and certain aspects edited. Originally, Spidey realised where Electro was going thanks to the clue of Electro shouting ""Top of the world, Man!"" but Spidey just happens to guess correctly in the edited version.At the end of the game, The Mighty Thor is given all the praise for defeating Electro. In the original cut of the game, Thor was intended to have appeared in a video segment, where he speaks with Spidey just after Hyper-Electro was defeated, and Thor is seen later as having defeated Electro.Multiple levels of the game were renamed. </div>  <div> Response : The game recieved rather negative riews in comparison to it's predecessor. IGN gave the game 5.5/10 bluntly stating ""Don't buy this game."" making mention of inconsistent gameplay, and an overall irritable experience.On Gamespot, the game got 7.1 however.

After Spyro defeats him an end clip shows Spyro back in the starting world in the Artisan World discussing his victory over Gnorc with the reporter.After the credits however it is revealed to Spyro that Gnasty‚Äôs treasure portal is locked until the player achieves 100%, and upon accomplishing this and collecting the treasure within the world an alternative ending unfolds in which Spyro is again being interviewed by the news team just as another magic spell suddenly crystallises all of the dragons once more. Spyro‚Äôs response, ‚ÄúHere we go again!‚Äù </div>  <div> Gameplay : Fire! To end all you've become.The gameplay is that of a traditional platformer of the era in that the aims and objectives of the game are to collect all of the dragon‚Äôs stolen treasure, rescue and free all of the trapped dragons and recover all of the stolen dragon eggs taken by thieves whilst all of the dragons were encased in crystal. The game also tasks players with defeating several different bosses sent by Gnasty Gnorc to each of the different hubworlds within the Dragon Realms.As such the game takes place across the various hub worlds within the Dragon Realms and features a free roaming aspect similar to other 3D platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Within each of the six hubworlds are portals which Spyro uses to travel to the various Dragon Realms (think of these as separate stages or levels that work in a similar way to paintings in Super Mario 64 or jigsaws in Banjo-Kazooie) and for the majority of the game each hubworld contains various standard platforming levels as well as a flight stage and boss stage. To traverse between the various hubs players must find the Balloonist NPC who will fly Spyro between the various hubs in their hot air balloon after the player has met some arbitrary goal such as collecting a set amount of treasure, freeing a specific number of dragons or recovering so many of the stolen dragon eggs. The six hubs in which players visit over the course of the game are the following:Artisans World Peace Keepers WorldMagic Crafters WorldBeast Makers WorldDream Weavers HomeGnasty‚Äôs WorldTo combat the various foes Spyro encounters throughout the game, he can either breath fire or charge at them with his horns. Over the course of the game players will also encounter enemies immune to one type of Spyro‚Äôs attacks and so armoured enemies must be dealt with using the charge attack and larger foes incinerated via a burst of fire. He can also perform a glide jump and upon reaching the end of his glide will flap his wings to gain some height before falling. This is particularly useful whilst traversing some of the games more difficult jumps.Another of the games unique elements is the way in which Spyro‚Äôs health is displayed to the player. This is where Spyro‚Äôs companion Sparx comes into play as his color is the method of communicating Spyro‚Äôs health to the player. The various states are:Yellow - indicating Spyro is at full healthBlue - indicating Spyro is at 3/4‚Äôs healthGreen - indicating 2/4 healthA missing Sparx - indicates that Spyro is one hit away from deathSpyro‚Äôs method of regaining lost health is to feed Sparx butterflies which appear when he torches any of the various animals which inhabit the games stages such as rabbits or sheep. Like most other platformers, Spyro‚Äôs amount of lives is finite but free lives are scattered across the various worlds within ‚Äúclam shell‚Äù boxes. Additional lives can also be earned through collecting orbs which are dropped from defeated enemies who no longer hold gems (which they drop upon being defeated for the first time). Finally another of Sparx‚Äôs attributes is to collect any nearby treasure which Spyro has failed to pick up.  </div>  <div> Soundtrack : 1.""Opening (Theme from Spyro the Dragon)""2.""Artisan's Home""3.""Stone Hill""4.""Dark Hollow""5.""Town Square""6.""Sunny Flight""7.""Toasty""8.""Peace Keeper's Home""9.""Peace Keepers (Alternate Theme)""10.""Dry Canyon""11.""Cliff Town""12.""Ice Cavern""13.""Night Flight""14.""Dr. Shemp""15.""Magic Crafter's Home""16.""Magic Crafters (Alternate Theme)""17.""Alpine Ridge""18.""High Caves""19.""Wizard Peak""20.""Crystal Flight""21.""Blowhard""22.""Beast Maker's Home""23.""Terrace Village""24.""Misty Bog""25.""Tree Tops""26.""Wild Flight""27.""Metalhead""28.""Dream Weaver's Home""29.""Dream Weavers (Alternate Theme)""30.""Dark Passage""31.""Lofty Castle""32.""Haunted Towers""33.""Icy Flight""34.""Jacques""35.""Gnorc Cove""36.""Twilight Harbor""37.""Gnasty Gnorc""38.""Gnasty's Loot""39.""Credits"" </div>  <div> Trivia : Spyro is voiced by Carlos Alazraqui who also voiced the Taco Bell dog.The soundtrack was composed by Stewart Copeland, the drummer and founder of the English rock band, The Police. </div>  <div> ESRB : The ESRB rated the game Everyone for Comic Mischief. </div> "

It stars Imperial officer turned mercenary Kyle Katarn, who is hired by the Rebel Alliance to investigate and dismantle a secret Imperial weapons program.",3030-11023,11023,0,1995-02-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-dark-forces/3030-11023/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Star Wars: Dark Forces is a first-person shooter set in George Lucas' Star Wars universe, and developed and published by LucasArts. Released originally for DOS computers in February 1995, the game would also come to Mac later that year, and the PlayStation in 1996. Both the PC and PlayStation versions were digitally re-released in later years.The title cardDark Forces introduces players to Kyle Katarn, a one-time Imperial officer who became disillusioned with the Empire and began to take on mercenary work for the Rebel Alliance. The game is set contemporaneous to the original trilogy, and begins with Katarn stealing the plans to the first Death Star. However, from there it branches off into a storyline that is unrelated to the films, detailing Katarn's discovery of the Empire's covert Dark Trooper Project and his subsequent efforts to prevent it from being brought to bear against the Rebel Alliance.With the exception of the PlayStation version, which was largely deemed to be inferior, Dark Forces was quite well-received upon its initial release, and its success laid the groundwork for future games in the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight franchise. Furthermore, certain aspects of its narrative, such as its protagonist, Kyle Katarn, and the concept of Dark Troopers, would become well-known parts of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Its engine, known as the Jedi engine, would also be used for a later LucasArts first-person shooter, Outlaws. </div>  <div> Development : Dark Forces was created by a team of twenty developers at LucasArts (not including testers and product support), and took roughly twenty months in total to complete. The project was led by one Daron Stinnett, who was hired by LucasArts in 1993 specifically to develop a game for them using the Star Wars license. While Stinnett had originally entertained the idea of a flight simulation game due to his previous flight sim experience working for Spectrum Holobyte, the recent success of id Software's Wolfenstein 3D and the impending release of Doom convinced him to pursue a Star Wars first-person shooter. With the FPS genre still being relatively uncharted territory, Stinnett prioritized raw talent over experience while putting together the development team, even going as far as to hire architectural undergraduates (Ingar Shu and Matt Tateishi) from the University of California at Berkeley as level designers. Stinnett admitted later that the newly-created team, which had neither worked together before nor worked on an FPS, was flying by the seat of its pants in the early goings, saying that ""usually when you develop a game, you have some idea of where you're headed and how to get there. With Dark Forces, we winged it at the beginning"".The Jedi engine is capable of simulating environmental effects such as the red haze of the ""Blood Moon,"" Gromas 16.The Jedi engine, which is primarily credited to lead programmer Ray Gresko, took some six months to coalesce into a working state, and realism was one of the main motivations behind its creation. In order to achieve a heightened sense of realism within the game world, the Jedi engine implements truly three-dimensional environments in which rooms can exist on top of one another, something most contemporary FPS engines, like the Doom engine, were not capable of. The game's programmers also implemented other features that were not common to first-person engines at the time, including the ability to display polygonal 3D objects and atmospheric effects such as fog. In addition, the player's abilities within this game world were intended to match the overall realism of the setting, and thus the ability to jump, crouch, and to look up and down were included.In terms of narrative, Dark Forces was originally intended to star Luke Skywalker, and its story was to adhere closely to the events of the films. However, the designers quickly began to feel limited by this idea, and it would ultimately be the project's lead artist, Justin Chin, who would devise a plotline that branched away from the more well-established fiction of the franchise. Inspired by the setting, he pitched an idea to Stinnett and Gresko involving an elite force of stormtroopers, and after receiving positive feedback, he quickly put together a design document detailing characters, a story arc, and an outline for thirty-two missions (which would later be pared down to fourteen). In addition to creating the story, Chin was responsible for much of the visual design of the game, both through conceptualization and through hiring and managing the game's other artists. Many of the game's new additions to the Star Wars universe, including weapons and enemies, are attributed primarily to him.In order to properly evoke the well-known look and feel of the Star Wars films, the level design team for Dark Forces endeavored to create settings that would feel vibrant and alive when compared to the more abstracted visuals of games like Doom. Various techniques were employed to accomplish this goal; levels in Dark Forces incorporate working machinery like elevators and conveyor belts, ambient activity such as flowing water and roving mouse droids, and free-moving 3D objects like cargo crates and space ships. In addition to the levels themselves, gameplay also drew significant inspiration from cinema. Chin, who was responsible for mapping out many of the game's puzzles and action sequences, cited the original Star Wars trilogy, Die Hard, and James Bond as inspirations for some of the game's challenges. In point of fact, living up to the movies was of paramount importance to the game's project leader. ""This would be the first time anyone could actually walk around in a Star Wars universe,"" said Stinnett, adding ""It had to have the same rich look and feel and sound and detail of the movies, plus compelling gameplay."" </div>  <div> Plot : The events of Dark Forces are told from the perspective of Kyle Katarn, a mercenary and ex-Imperial soldier hired by the Rebel Alliance to complete dangerous missions. Before he became affiliated with the Empire or the Alliance, Katarn grew up within a farming community on Sulon and dreamed of becoming a mechanic like his father, Morgan Katarn. While away at the Academy, his home was attacked by Imperial forces, and his parents killed; Katarn, however, believing the Empire's version of events, quickly enlisted in the Imperial Army. It was there that he met Jan Ors, who was at the time working as a double agent for the Alliance. Sensing a growing discontentment with the Empire, Ors fed Katarn information that revealed to him the truth about the Empire's attack on Sulon, and in return Katarn rescued Ors when her cover was blown, ending both of their tenures in the Empire. Though he did not entirely trust the Alliance, due to his hatred for the Empire and his respect for Ors Katarn began to take on mercenary work for them.As Dark Forces begins, Katarn is participating in ""Operation Skyhook,"" a covert mission intended to steal the plans for the Empire's first Death Star from their secret base on Danuta. Katarn is successful in retrieving the plans, and from here the game jumps forward in time to a point after the Battle of Yavin, in which the Death Star was destroyed. Kyle is now called upon by Mon Mothma to investigate a mysterious development at Tak Base on Talay, which was attacked and destroyed by the Empire with surprising speed. A weapon left behind at the base leads Katarn and Ors, now acting as Katarn's mission officer, to suspect that the attack on Tak Base was related to the Empire's Dark Trooper Project. An inscription on the weapon leads them to a weapon designer named Moff Rebus, who, when confronted, inadvertently tips them off about the existence of an Imperial weapon research facility on Fest. Katarn explores the facility on Fest, and in so doing discovers a sample of a rare metal known as phrik.As always, the Empire is up to no good.Now knowing that phrik is crucial to the production of Dark Troopers, Katarn and Ors track down an Imperial phrik mining operation on Gromas 16. Katarn infiltrates the mine and attaches a sequencer charge to the mine's reactor, allowing him to destroy the entire facility remotely. With the mine destroyed, Kyle turns his attention next to an Imperial detention center on Orinackra where an important spy is being held. Once freed, the spy informs Katarn that the mine he destroyed on Gromas 16 was the first of three production phases for the Dark Trooper Project, with the second being a robotics facility and the third being an imperial ship called the Arc Hammer. By tracking smuggler activity Katarn is able to quickly ascertain the location of the Dark Trooper robotics facility: the ice planet Anteevy. He travels there next, and is able to destroy the operation in short order, once again using sequencer charges to level the entire structure. He then heads to Nar Shaddaa hoping to obtain further information on smuggling routes.Kyle obtains an Imperial navigational card while on Nar Shaddaa, but upon trying to leave, he and Ors are captured by Jabba the Hutt. Jabba attempts to kill Katarn by feeding him to his pet kell dragons, but Katarn is able to overcome the beasts with his bare hands before escaping with Ors and the nav card. Now with a nav card but no decryption key, Kyle travels to Coruscant to decode the card so that it might lead him closer to the Arc Hammer and the final stage of Dark Trooper production. The decoded card leads him to a refueling station where Katarn absconds with a ship bound for the Executor, the only ship with knowledge of the Arc Hammer's whereabouts. From there, Kyle sneaks aboard the Arc Hammer via a cargo container and begins the task of destroying the main Dark Trooper production facility. After setting charges, Katarn moves to escape only to be confronted by Gernal Mohc, head of the Dark Trooper Project, in an advanced armor suit. Katarn defeats Mohc and escapes the Arc Hammer as it explodes. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Kyle Katarn must fight off vicious kell dragons, among other things, in his pursuit of the Dark Trooper Project.Dark Forces is a fast-paced first-person action game in the vein of early FPS titles like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. The player moves about a three-dimensional environment from a first-person perspective, using whatever weapons they may have to overcome enemies they encounter as they progress. New weapons are acquired either by taking them from defeated enemies or by finding them within the game world, and ammunition for these weapons can be found in much the same way. Players can increase their survivability and heal wounds by finding shield units and med kits, or gain powerful temporary boosts through power-ups, which are often hidden. Certain items may also be used to benefit the player in ways not related to combat; a head lamp or infrared goggles can be activated to increase visibility, while an air mask can filter breathable air while in a toxic area. Auxiliary abilities may require constant battery power in order to maintain their use, and if the player expends this power they must obtain batteries to replenish it.While the main emphasis of Dark Forces is combat, missions are story-driven, and they are preceded by briefings of the level to come that outline the player's main objectives as well as the narrative impetus for them. Mission objectives often force the player to solve some manner of puzzle in order to proceed or at the very least to be observant of their surroundings. Dark Forces also allows the player to run, jump, crouch, and to look up and down. Depending on the scenario, these different forms of movement and traversal may also be necessary to employ in order to complete a level. Unlike many PC first-person shooters, Dark Forces does not allow the player to save their game while within a mission; instead, the player is given a set number of lives with which to complete a given level. Should the player lose all of their health, they will lose a life and be respawned at a nearby location with 100 hit points and 100 shield points. Should the player lose all of their lives, they can no longer continue, and must restart the level. </div>  <div> Weapons : Dark Forces includes ten different weapons, many of which possess alternate firing methods. Of particular note is the fact that Dark Forces features shared ammunition types for many of its armaments. Power cells, for instance, are used by not only the Imperial Repeater Gun, but also the Jeron Fusion Cutter and the Stouker Concussion Rifle. This means that players must be cognizant of the fact that depleting their ammo supplies might render multiple weapons unusable. Several of Dark Forces' weapons were created specifically for the game, and had not previously appeared in any other Star Wars medium.Fist </div>  <div> Enemies : Hotkey: 1Ammo: NoneFists are the only melee weapon in Dark Forces, and are available to the player from the start. Kyle's hands seemingly have an area of effect, as he can in fact hit multiple enemies with a single punch, contrary to what one might expect. Enemies may also be knocked back by the force of the blow. In spite of these advantageous properties, fists are mostly a last resort weapon for use when absolutely necessary, though they can be effective against melee opponents.Modified Bryar Pistol  </div>  <div> Reception : Hotkey: 2Ammo: Energy UnitsThe personal sidearm of Kyle Katarn, the Modified Bryar Pistol is a reliable blaster that serves dutifully as the player's default weapon. Its biggest advantage is its range, as it is one of the most accurate long-range guns in Dark Forces. It is also quite efficient, using only one energy unit with each firing. Its slow firing rate makes it somewhat prohibitive in close combat situations, however, and though it is very accurate, to be sure, it also causes less damage at long range.Stormtrooper Laser Rifle </div>  <div> System Requirements : Hotkey: 3Ammo: Energy UnitsThe Stormtrooper Laser Rifle is an upgrade to the Bryar Pistol in some respects, though a step down in others. On the positive side, it fires much faster than the Bryar Pistol, making it far superior in close combat or against groups of enemies. It is significantly less efficient, however, using two energy units per bolt rather than one, and is wildly inaccurate outside of close-to-medium range. Just like the Bryar Pistol, its bolts lose a good deal of their punch when used from a distance.Thermal Detonator </div> "

As the game is non-canon, it also includes nods to other characters in the expanded universe (including Mara Jade and lesser-known bounty hunter Jodo Kast).Along with including the classic characters and locales, Masters of Ter√§s K√§si is known for its weapon-based combat, as players can toggle (on-the-fly) use of their character's particular weapon (either blasters, staffs, and lightsabers) and change their moveset. This is the only traditional fighting game developed for the series (not including the guest appearances in Soulcalibur IV). </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes twelve playable characters, four of which must be unlockable. Each of the characters can be classified by the weapon they can equip (with the exceptions of Arden Lyn, who does not equip any weapon, and Thok, who is always equipped with a battle axe). </div> "

An enhanced port of the original was released for the PlayStation 2 in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation on June 13, 2006 (including new game modes and gameplay mechanics).

This version was further revised in the Street Fighter Collection compilation (for the Saturn on November 30, 1997 and PlayStation on December 16, 1997) as Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (Street Fighter Zero 2' in Japan and Street Fighter Alpha 2' in Europe), adding Cammy in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance as a hidden playable character.The original game was ported to the Saturn and PlayStation on September 30, 1996, featuring an arranged soundtrack and the game's hidden boss (Shin Akuma) as a hidden playable character. It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 1996 (as one of the two games to use the S-DD1 microchip enhancement for sprite data, causing some loading times) and the PC on November 1998. The game was later re-released (alongside a revised Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold) for the PlayStation 2 in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation on June 13, 2006.

The main new feature in Street Fighter Alpha 2 is the custom combo system which replaces chain combos from the previous game. When the custom combo guage is at level 1 or above the player can activate a custom combo by by pressing two punch buttons following a kick. Custom combos grant the player a limited amount of time to chain almost any attacks together into a combo. The time limit is dependent on how much power was in the super meter when the combo was initiated.  </div>  <div> Characters : The game's roster includes 18 playable fighters, five of which are new additions.

The game also includes some new exclusive characters (including minor film character Sawada and masked Bison Trooper Blade).The game was ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn by Capcom on August 10, 1995 (with the overseas PS1 release delayed as one of the platform's launch titles). It was published by Acclaim overseas and was re-titled to Street Fighter: Real Battle on Film in Japan. While featuring the same digitized sprites as the arcade version, this version features a new gameplay engine that closely resembles Super Street Fighter II Turbo (with the addition of enhanced special moves, known as ""super attacks""). In addition, it features different stages, a new soundtrack, an updated character roster, and a dedicated Story Mode. </div>  <div> Characters : Most of the roster from Super Street Fighter II Turbo appears in the original Arcade version of the game, with the only exceptions being Blanka, Dhalsim, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. Both Blanka and Dee Jay were later added in the home versions. Each fighter is portrayed by the same actor as in the film, with the exception of Bison (who is played by the actor's stunt double due to his illness).Both versions of the game include a new fighter: Japanese soldier Sawada (a minor character in the film played by Japanese actor Kenya Sawada). The arcade version also features its own exclusive character: the masked Bison Trooper Blade (played by the game's art director). The game also includes three hidden palette swapped variations of Blade (Arkane, Khyber, and F7).It is the only game in the series where Balrog, Vega, and Bison are addressed by their swapped western names in the Japanese version (rather than their original names), requiring Capcom to put their original names alongside their western names in the Japanese instruction cards and manuals. The arcade version is also the only game in the series where Akuma is addressed by his western name in the Japanese version.Guile - Jean-Claude Van DammeCammy - Kylie MinogueRyu - Byron MannKen - Damian ChapaE.

Street Racer,Vivid Image,Ubisoft,"October 31, 1996",ps,"Up to eight players can race over twenty-seven courses, rumble in a battle arena or play car soccer in this multiplatform cart racer.",3030-22190,22190,0,1994-01-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/street-racer/3030-22190/,," <div> Overview : Street Racer is a cart-racing game, developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft and inspired heavily by Super Mario Kart, and the first of its genre to allow 8 players to race simultaneously on split-screen. The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game. </div> "

This game is considered the true sequel to the original Strider, rather than Strider Returns. Strider Returns is not considered a part of the series, as it was not developed by Capcom, it was exclusive to the west, and most people hated it. Strider 2, on the other hand, was very well received. Unfortunately, despite being hailed by critics and series fans, Strider 2 did not sell well.The Playstation version of the game included the original Strider on a separate disc, for those who had never played it to become accomodated with the series. In the United States, there was a printing error for the game that swapped the labelling of each CD, so the Strider 2 disc was labelled Strider, and the Strider disc was labelled Strider 2. </div>  <div> Story : Not for long, it doesn'tStrider Hiryu has returned, once again wielding his powerful, plasma cypher, called the Falchion. The Grand Master Meio has taken over the world. He rules as a despot, and the world is spiraling towards cataclysmic annihilation. The game follows Strider, as he takes out terrorists, investigates disgusting genetic experiments, takes on Meio's fleet, travels to the Third Moon and ultimately destroys this tyrant, freeing the world from his iron grip once and for all. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Showing off in the tropospehereStrider 2 is a fast paced arcade-style hack n' slash action platformer. The game's primary focus is fast and furious action, even moreso than its predecessor. Strider, Falchion in hand, will run through each level, taking on a plethora of enemies. Each stage is littered with bosses, too, which provide a suitable challenge for our hero. Strider is unique in that there are so many bosses on each stage. Additionally, at the end of each stage, there is a final boss. Strider begins the game with only four life, which he must be cautious to keep. As the game progresses, Strider can increase his stamina by gathering special katakana. The game draws heavily from other platform games as well, with a number of obstacles in the players way, requiring tricky jumping and expert timing. Strider is more than up to the task, as he can double jump, climb up walls, and hang from ceilings. Throughout each level are flame spitting jets, moving platforms, and other obstacles that break up the action, for a more platforming style gameplay. In true Strider fashion, the game features a number of gravity-defying segments that see our hero running upside-down on walls in altered gravity, as well as spinning around and floating in zero gravity.Like the previous game Strider 2 plays rather simply. Most of the gameplay is done with two button, one to perform acrobatic jumps, and the other to slice and dice with Strider Hiryu's Falchion. Strider 2 allows Hiryu to run, as well, with a double tap on the directional pad. Strider Hiryu also gains the ability to slide with down jump. Hiryu's prowess with the blade has improved as well, as he gains the ""rapid"" attack,That dude is about to get an unpleasant surpriseinitiated by holding down the attack button. There are many powerups for Hiryu to collect, which are both hidden in each stage in special capsules, and dropped by enemies. These include sword powerups and ""boost"" icons. Sword powerups will increase the effectiveness of Strider Hiryu's Falchion, increasing its length, and improving its power. The ""boost"" powerups are new to the series, and drastically increase Hiryu's power. When activated, Strider Hiryu will go into ""boost"" mode, creating a colorful aura around Hiryu, and making him a force to be reckoned with for a brief period of time. His Falchion's power is boosted, and each slash of the sword will send out a colorful prejoectile, which flies around, damaging enemies.As an arcade style game, points are a major part of Strider's charm. Strider Hiryu will gain points for defeating foes, which are collected when he grabs lorge, colorful orbs that they drop. Each stage also has a number of hidden score tokens, coming in the form of cows, barrels, and other nonsens items, which provide a sufficient score boost. At the end of each stage, performance will be graded, which can drastically increase Hiryu's score. Strider Hiryu is awarded points for remaining life, items picked up, and the ""special"" bonus, requiring that Hiryu make it through the level uscathed. The game provides leaderboards for top scorers, and the fastest completion times. </div>  <div> Stages : Strider HienUpon beating the game, players will unlock a second character, Strider Hien. Strider controls essentially the same as Hiryu, posessing the same running, jumping and climing prowess as Hiryu. The major differences in gameplay come in combat. Hien wields two cyphers, which he throws at enemies to attack. Each cypher will target a certain enemy when thrown (though they still damage anything they come into contact with) before returning to Hien like a boomerang. Hien's weapon powerup will give him a third cypher to use in combat. Hien has a single close range move, the Savage Slash. Unlike Hiryu, Strider Hien cannot select his level, and must play them through in order. </div> "

Originally planned as a single game, it has gone on to spawn five sequels and multiple spin-offs. The game was first released in Japan in December 1995, United States in December 1996, and Europe in 1996 for the Sony Playstation. In 1998, the game was released for both the Sega Saturn (Japan) and the PC (Japan, China, and Korea). In its lifetime, Suikoden has sold roughly 216,542 copies.In 2008, it was released as a PSone Classic on the PlayStation Network. A Japanese-only mobile version was released the same year. </div>  <div> Story : The game is set in a fantasy world resembling feudal China. It begins in Solar Year 455 and ends in 457. The game follows the adventures of Tir McDohl, a young staff fighter. He learns early on that he is destined to be the ""Tenkai Star"", a prophesied hero that will unite the 108 Stars of Destiny and bring forth a new age of prosperity. Throughout the game, Tir learns of the 27 True Runes, which hold great power. These same runes, if in the wrong hands can be used to destroy or enslave the world. Early in the game, Tir inherits the Rune of Life and Death, also known as ""Soul Eater"", which grants him great power, but that power comes at a price.Tir and his entourage encounter many enemies throughout the game. Their main foe is the Scarlet Moon Empire. Tir's father, Teo McDohl is one of the Six Great Generals of the Scarlet Moon Army. Tir briefly joins the army, but soon becomes entangled with a rebel force known as the Liberation army. Tir and his friends join the rebel army after learning of its' goals and the tyrannous ways of the empire. They then begin the long journey to stop to the empire's evil ways, and restore it to its former glory. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Suikoden was one of the first (traditional) RPGs for the Playstation. There are three types of combat in Suikoden: standard turn-based, large army battles, and one on one duels. The turn-based battles are much the same as any traditional Japanese RPG, giving the player time to choose their actions and fight at their own pace. The large scale army battles work on a glorified rock, paper, scissors type system, with players choosing from 3 different units and going against the enemy's unit until one side defeats the other. The one on one battles work largely the same as the army battles with the player choosing one of 3 different attack types each turn. A wrong choice in any battle could result in the permanent death of one of the 108 stars. Losing one of the main characters effects the outcome of the game.The major goal in the game is to recruit all 108 stars while progressing through the story. All of the 108 are usable at any time after they have recruited. Some of the characters you recruit are Active, meaning that you will be able to add them to your six person entourage. Others are Passive, meaning that they are not available for your entourage. Passive characters will stay at your headquarters and setup five different kinds of stores. Those stores are a blacksmith, an appraiser, an armorsmith, a runemaster, and general goods. Other passive characters will be available for mini-games such as a dice game, a memory game or a coin-and-cup game. Others serve as an outlet to customize your menu window theme, sound theme, and bathhouse decorations. There are many characters who serve as both Active and Passive.A major perk of the game was the ability to transfer your data from Suikoden I to its sequel, Suikoden II. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The OST Cover ArtThe Suikoden soundtrack was released as 2 discs and with 48 tracks on April 5, 1996. Published by King Records and was composed and arranged by Miki Higashino, Tappy Iwase, Taniguchi Hirofumi, Mayuko Kageshita and Hiroshi Tamawari.

He stated that the limited moral choices in the game, some of which turn out to be false choices, are what inspired him to explore the concept much further and attempt to offer meaningful choices that actually matter. In turn, modern choice-based role-playing shooters like Mass Effect and Fallout 3 are considered ""descendants"" of Deus Ex.  </div> "
Suikoden II,Konami,Konami,"August 31, 1999",ps,Suikoden II is set three years after the events of Suikoden and tells the story of how young friends Riou and Jowy become caught up in the conflict between the Highland Empire and the City States of Jowston. Can you recruit all 108 Stars of Destiny and unite a nation?,3030-10120,10120,0,1998-12-17,https://www.giantbomb.com/suikoden-ii/3030-10120/,ESRB: T," <div> Gameplay : Suikoden II is a role-playing game with some light strategic elements woven throughout. The player controls a silent protagonist and travels around the world map, advancing the plot by completing tasks and talking with other characters. The player can also recruit new characters to his cause, 108 in total, often involving a short sidequest to do so. In towns, the player can gather information, rest, recover and save at Inns, attach Runes (the source of spells/magic found in the game), sharpen characters' weaponry, and buy items and equipment; wilderness areas generally feature random encounters with monsters.The battle system to Suikoden II features six person parties. A variety of statistics determine in-game combat ability. If all six characters lose all their hit points and are thus incapacitated, it is game over and the player must restart. Exceptions exist for certain plot battles in which winning is optional; the player can lose and the plot continues on, albeit in a slightly different fashion.Runes, the source of all magic in the world of Suikoden II, are handled the same as the original Suikoden. Characters have a certain number of spell usages per ""spell level;"" for instance, a character with 4 level 1 spell slots and a Water Rune could cast ""Kindness Drops"" (the level 1 Water Rune spell) 4 times. Other runes offer different benefits, and some may be used as often as desired. Runes can also be affixed to character's weaponry for added effects, elemental bonuses and status enhancements.Updates from the original Suikoden include a grid and unit based tactical battle system, the addition of a three rune slot system which allows for three different runes to be equipped at once (left hand, right hand and head -- some runes can only attach to a specific slot), a party inventory system, and a ""dash"" button that allowed the player to move around the screen quicker and vast graphical improvement. A transfer of data from the prior game in the series enables returning characters to enter the fray with higher levels and improved weapons. With this data the player is also given the option of recruiting a secret character, the hero from the original game Tir McDohl. References to the events of the original Suikoden are also adapted accordingly for a greater feel in continuity. </div>  <div> Characters : Following the formula of the original Suikoden, Suikoden II contains three different types of combat: </div>  <div> Story : A typical random battle. The party the player has selected of up to 6 allies faces off with 1-6 enemies in standard, turn based combat. This battle type is considered typical in RPGs, containing options for attack, magic (Runes), items etc. One of the more unique features of the Suikoden series is the option to utilize the 'Unite' option in battle -- this allows certain combinations of characters to combine a more powerful attack as one unit. Uniting groups can simply make use of 2 characters, such as Riou and Jowy's 'Buddy Attack' which is available from the start of the game, to larger groups of 4 and 5 characters at once. This is the only battle style where the player can gain experience, items or Potch (Suikoden II's currency). </div>  <div> Legacy : At several points during the game the player character is pitted against another character in single combat. This style of fighting only has three moves: Attack, Wild Attack, and Defend. This duel is played in a Rock, Paper, Scissors style where ""Attack"" beats ""Defend"", ""Wild Attack"" beats ""Attack"" and ""Defend"" beats ""Wild Attack"". Each round the player must select one of the three attacks while their opponents choice is hidden. The player however can usually tell what kind of attack the enemy is going to perform by the taunts displayed. </div>  <div> Soundtracks : Branching out from the massive battles from Suikoden I which were more like a large-scale duel system, more interactivity was added to this element of the gameplay over that of its predecessor. This time, the Massive Battles take the form of a light SRPG. As the main character recruits characters for his castle, this opens up more options for more units. Certain characters are 'unit leaders' while others are 'supports'. Every character adds a certain amount of defense or attack to a unit. In addition, certain characters also add special abilities to the unit they are attached to. The numbers affect the chances of win or loss as much as the type of units being pitted against each other. Every unit may take up to a total of two 'losses' which are counted when a unit suffers a severe amount of casualties. Each skirmish they take part in might result in no loss, loss on one side, or even loss on both sides. As mentioned before, certain characters add special abilities to the units. Examples of these abilities include being able to take more losses than usual, magic or archery to allow attacks from a distance, healing of itself or others, etc. When a unit suffers its maximum losses it will retreat from battle, when this happens there is a possibility of the characters in the unit being wounded or even killed. Should a character be killed in a massive battle, they are considered permanently dead. </div>  <div> The 108 Stars of Destiny :  Riou is the protagonist of the game. A member of the Highland Army's Unicorn Brigade. Brother to Nanami and best friend to Jowy. Flees the army after his unit is slaughtered where upon he joins up with Flik and Viktor's mercenary group. He wields half of the Rune of the Beginning known as the Bright Shield Rune, one of the 27 True Runes. </div> "

If at anytime four of the same colored gem is matched in a 2X2 fashion, they will conglomerate into one giant gem. The bigger then gem the more points one can score when the matching color of exploding gem is attached. This is a very High Risk, High Reward puzzle game, in that the bigger sets of gems, the less work space you get. The reward is when exploded, the gems will move onto the opponents playing field. When gems hit the opponents side, the gems start off as gem counters with a number on them and a color. Every time the opponent drops a set of blocks on his side the counter will drop by one. This See-Saw style battle goes back and forth until one of the players has no more room to drop gems.Occasionally the game will drop down a Multicolored Diamond gem. Any color that the bottom point of this diamond touches will explode without having the need to be adjacent to it. As a result, the Diamond gem is best used when in a tight situation or a lead up to a chain combo as when exploded gems disappear, they fall prey to the laws of physics. Any Counter gems that get sent to the playing field via the Diamond gem only start the counter at half the amount rather than the full amount, thus reiterating the High Risk, High Reward strategy.The Playstation/Sega Saturn/Game Boy Advance versions of the game included ""Street Puzzle"" mode, where players would take on specific match fights pitting the selected character against a certain enemy of varying difficulty in order to unlock secret characters, alternate costumes, intermission cutscenes, music BGMs ( Including the vocal song ""I Want You to Know"" by Sakura Kasugano), etc. The HD Remix version of the game has some of these unlocks available from the beginning, yet this mode and a large portion of the goodies are entirely discluded. </div>  <div> Characters : There are 8 main characters you can play as. 4 are taken from the Street Fighter series ( Ryu, Ken, Chun Li and Sakura) and 4 are from the Darkstalkers series ( Morrigan, Donovan, Felicia and Hsien-ko) Character selection is more important then just aesthetics in this puzzle game as it determines the pattern of the gems you drop on your opponents side. Your fighter was represented by a super deformed tiny version of your character who stood next to your puzzle board and would do their signature special attacks when you did a fair amount of damage. They were just for show and had no effect on the game.There were also 3 secret characters: Akuma, Devilot and Dan </div> "

Tail of the Sun,Artdink,SCEA,"April 30, 1997",ps,"Tail of the Sun (Wild, Pure, Simple Life) is a cave man simulator that takes place on a pre-historic Earth. It's your mission to guide a tribe of cavemen in creating a tower of mammoth tusks that will lead them to the sun.",3030-20239,20239,0,1997-04-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/tail-of-the-sun/3030-20239/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Gameplay : Many of the usual game conventions are discarded in Tail of the Sun. For example, rather than having a set number of ""lives,"" you choose a tribe member, of which there are a nearly infinite supply, to play as until his or her death, repeating the process until the end. The world consists of one large landmass consisting of different environments (such as desert, tundra, and grasslands) with no breaks or loading screens. Additionally, the game doesn't present a normal health bar, but rather a ring of flames that slowly burn out, symbolizing the cave person's lifespan. Typically, death occurs due to an attack by wildlife, old age (as denoted by the flames), or drowning, after which you are returned to the tribe to select a new avatar. Your cave person will also get tired from time to time and fall asleep, and will be vulnerable for the duration (usually no more than 1 minute) although this can be manually overridden.Due to the open-ended nature of the game design, and the difficulty in collecting mammoth tusks, completing the game is seen as something of a challenge. Building the tower to completion can take many hours. </div>  <div> Exploration & Cultural Level Ups : South of the main village are a number of stones which can power up a specific aspect of your tribe including jumping, running, and swimming (for example, the ""swimming"" stone allows your tribesmen to swim, which is essential for exploring many parts of the expansive game world). You will also acquire cultural level ups from time to time that will improve your tribe's capabilities: lung capacity (for holding your breath); fertility (for making more tribe members); legs (stamina for running); and intelligence (crafting better weapons). For example, though you begin the game with just a stick you will eventually build better weapons, culminating in a spear, which is more effective at taking down large beasts.The game also keeps track of what animals you kill (in a long scrolling cave painting titled ""History"" documenting every kill). It appears that killing too many of one type (especially mammoths) leads to a sharp decline in their population numbers, making it difficult to achieve the game's goal. Certain beasts will leave behind meat, which you can choose to eat on the spot or send back to the tribe (the effects of which are unclear but may lead to cultural development).The game world is very large, especially considering it is contiguous (no load screens) and on the PS1. You will find snow-laden mountains, deserts, jungles, rivers, islands, and caves. Caves can be incredibly deep mazes that often contain hidden treasure troves of mammoth tusks. You will also find a series of strange statues around the world which represent different body parts (including hands, eyes, and a nose) and appear to have been left by an even older civilization. </div>  <div> Graphical and Musical Style : Tail of the Sun uses simple polygonal models and surreal textures to depict the world and its inhabitants. As a result the animals look like simple cave paintings. The world rolls over at the horizon, similar to games like Animal Crossing Wide World (which would be released much later). Weather effects such as rain and snow occur. There is also a progression from day to night, and at night many strange stars and planets stream across the sky with seemingly no rhyme or reason. Scattered around the world are edible plants, flowers, fruits, and nuts, which are actually scanned images of baked goods made by one of the game's staff.

Each team are a different color, but have no different specialities to other teams. The teams available as are, red, blue, green, yellow, pink, purple, orange, and brown. The game is an RTS game with a twist. Players control one buddy and give out orders to the rest of the team. The team consists of four buddies including the player. Building teammates and weapons is very simple. The main resource is crates. Each stage has one or more crate drop points where crates constantly drop, which can be taken back to base to build stuff.At the base is a 2 x 2 x 2 stacking grid. Players can put crates on the grid in different combinations to get different weapons. All the crates are red except for blue super crates, which turns weapons into a super weapon.If a base is destroyed, the stacking grid can no longer be used, which means the player can't build any buddies, weapons, or vehicles. One of the objectives in the game is to destroy the enemy bases to obtain a huge advantage in the battle.Some single player missions start the player at a disadvantage by providing a limited number of crates to build with, which means the player must be efficient or try and steal an opponents crates. Some of the boss battles destroy the player's base right at the start. </div>  <div> Plot : Buddy Land is a surprisingly peaceful land. All the buddies were friendly and happy. Until one day, something came out of the sky and blocked the sun. The buddies called it The Great Eclipse, which started dropping crates. The buddies kicked them open to find weapons, which led to the buddies splitting themselves into colored teams and starting a full blown war.The single player campaign lets the player choose one of the colored teams and taking missions from eight different worlds. As the player progresses, they unlock more weapons to make through crates and even new buddies to make like ninja and cyborg buddies. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Being an RTS, Team Buddies strong point is its multiplayer games. Up to four players each control a team and commence beating the hell out of each other's buddies. There is no option for co-op battles.There are four different multiplayer match types. </div>  <div> Crate Formations : Out smart the opponent or rush in with all guns blazing and wipe out all the buddies off each teams to be the last buddy standing. There is always a time limit on this match, which means the player loses if time runs out. Players can choose which weapon set to use as well. Depending on what weapon set is chosen, different weapons will be created through crate combinations.In some maps, mega crates are dropped when something is triggered. These mega crates are hard to find, but they contain either a mega vehicle or a mega gun. These weapons can normally only be found in mega crates. In single player, mega crates allow players to use weapons from the next worlds weapon set. </div> "

The only way for you to come back is to make a deal with Satan to bring you back to life and make you the new Master of the Castle. After your revival, you notice many visitors coming into the castle for varying reasons, and you must choose whether to set traps and kill them or allow them to escape. Your main goal in Deception is to exact revenge against your brother, while Satan is using you to bring his dark powers to the world.

The traps can break and do not offer 100% success rates, so you have to use a combination of traps in order to take out your intruders. In order to lay out traps, however, you will need Magic Points and Gold. Both of these are gained when you kill an intruder and take their soul.  </div> "

While it follows the gameplay of traditional one-on-one fighting games (such as Virtua Fighter), Tekken is known for its unique four-button control scheme, where each button correlates to attacks from each of the fighter's limbs (left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg). It received numerous sequels and spin-offs, along with an animated film adaptation.As the game's hardware is based on the Sony PlayStation (the first game to do so), the game quickly received an accurate console port for that system, with a release on March 1995 (in Japan) and November 1995 (worldwide). This version is known for making all boss characters unlockable and for its video cutscenes, and was later digitally re-released for supporting PSOne Classics consoles in May-July 2011. This version was also included in the Japanese PlayStation 2 compilation namCollection. </div>  <div> Plot : Heihachi Mishima is the ruthless owner of the multi-national Mishima Zaibatsu company. He announces to the world the beginning of the first King of Iron Fist Tournament, with a prize reward of one billion dollars. 8 of the finest competitors in the world arrive to take part in the tournament. One of them, Heihachi's own son Kazuya, is not drawn towards the enormous cash reward but is fueled by revenge.When Kazuya was five years old Heihachi cast him from the top of a cliff, as he wanted to judge the power and determination of his son. Kazuya indeed survived the fall but it left a deep scar on his chest. Kazuya's blood loss would have proven fatal had the Devil not shown up to offer him the chance to seek revenge on his father in exchange for his soul. 21 years later and Kazuya is an undefeated fighting champion, he hears about the existence of his father's tournament and considers this his opportunity to seek revenge. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Tekken immediately sets itself apart from most other fighting games with its button scheme. Whereas most fighting game control schemes have different buttons corresponding to the power of the attacks (such as strong kick or light punch), in Tekken, each button corresponds with a limb (square for left punch, circle for right kick, ect.). Like most fighting games, there is a default setting of two rounds per match, and Tekken consists of the usual 1 on 1 combat found in fighting games, where you win after you deplete your opponents health bar. The player can get a ""perfect"" if they win a round without suffering any damage, a ""great"" if they win a round with a health bar that had less then about 5% health left and double K.O.'s can also occur. If the time limit expires (usually 60 seconds), the player with the least health loses. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes 17 characters, only eight of which are playable in the arcade version. Each character follows a standard arcade ladder: the rest of the main roster, followed by that character's rival (as the sub-boss), followed by final boss Heihachi.Each character also has an alternate costume. </div>  <div> Stages : Kazuya Mishima (has a unique unlockable ""Devil"" form in the PS1 version that serves as the final boss for Heihachi)Paul PhoenixMarshall LawJackNina WilliamsKingYoshimitsuMichelle Chang </div> "

It was originally made for Namco's own proprietary System 12 arcade hardware, an upgrade from their prior PS1-based System 11 boards.The game is set nineteen years after the events of Tekken 2, in which Heihachi Mishima defeated his own son Kazuya in the second ""King of Iron Fist"" martial arts tournament in order to reclaim his position as head of the powerful Mishima Zaibatsu. Tekken 3's plot centers around new character Jin Kazama, the orphaned son of Kazuya and Jun Kazama who has been trained by Heihachi over the last four years to fight in ""The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3"". However, Heihachi plans to use Jin and the other tournament participants as bait to lure out an ancient immortal being known as Ogre, believing he can harness the creature's power to further strengthen his own organization.A console port of the arcade version was released exclusively for PlayStation in 1998. In addition to various audiovisual and gameplay changes, the console version adds two new unlockable characters and game modes, including a beat-'em-up called ""Tekken Force"" and the volleyball-inspired ""Tekken Ball"".Tekken 3 was later used as the basis for the 1999 spin-off title Tekken Tag Tournament, which adds a tag team mechanic and restores most of the characters featured in prior Tekken entries. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Tekken 3 follows the same general control setup and fighting gameplay established by prior Tekken entries. The game uses eight-way directional controls and four buttons (as opposed to the six-button setup commonly used by Street Fighter and its derivatives), with each button roughly corresponding to one of the player character's limbs: Left Punch, Right Punch, Left Kick and Right Kick. By performing specific sequences of directional and button inputs, players can execute advanced character-specific fighting techniques, or link together successive strikes to form combo attacks.All characters can execute grapple throws which cannot be blocked by an opponent and usually deal significant damage. Typically these throw moves must be performed at very close range, though there are a few exceptions. A character on the receiving end of a grapple can potentially cancel their opponent's grapple by performing a certain timed input accordingly, such as pressing Left Punch or Right Punch at the moment the grapple is initiated.The 3D movement system has been completely revamped for Tekken 3 and plays a much more important role compared to previous Tekken titles. Players can now side-step into and out of the background in order to avoid an opponent's attacks and potentially set up their own counter-attack. </div>  <div> Characters : The original arcade version of Tekken 3 features eighteen unique playable characters, as well as the three clone characters Anna, Tiger and Panda that appear as alternate costumes for Nina, Eddy and Kuma respectively. Only ten characters are available upon the arcade hardware's initial activation: Jin, Forest, Hwoarang, Eddy, Xiaoyu, Paul, Nina, King, Yoshimitsu and Lei. The remaining hidden characters are time-locked, each one becoming available in succession after the machine has been in operation for a specified length of time.The home console version has different requirements for unlocking the hidden characters as specified below.

The North American version is a localized port from Japan and co-published by Sony Music Entertainment Japan and Activision. Known for its stealth gameplay and its feudal Japan setting, it was one of the first games that simulated the actual experience of being a ninja, incorporating elements of fantasy and mythology and used motion capture for character animation.The US version added two missions not found in the Japanese version and included slightly better graphics and animation. The game is compared to Metal Gear Solid, which came out only a few months later. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Rikimaru and AyameTenchu: Stealth Assassins is about assassination and stealth, as the name implies. You play as one of two ninja: Rikimaru, a scar-faced, white-haired ninja armed with a sword, and Ayame, a female ninja who uses wakizashi as her weapons. The two play differently, with Rikimaru being stronger, but Ayame being faster and having more combos. Both are equipped with grappling hooks, which let the ninja climb up and down rooftops, adding some fluid movement and flow in action/adventure games not seen at the time. All levels take place at night, due in part to graphical limitations of the PlayStation. The two ninjas also use other tools, including poison rice treats, smoke bombs, sleeping potions, explosives, and throwing stars to get past dogs and guards. There is a puzzle element to the game, as the objectives are vague enough to tell the player what to do, but don't really explain what steps need to be taken, unlike contemporary stealth game Goldeneye.There are ten missions total in the game, but it does offer replay value in if you beat levels without being detected: the ninjas get special items varying from a spell that makes you look like an enemy to sleeping potions. </div>  <div> Plot : Rikimaru and Ayame are two members of the Azuma ninja clan and grew up and trained with each other. Their heroic master, Lord Gohda, employ the two as spies to root out corruption and gather information in his province. The demonic sorcerer Lord Mei-Oh, king of hell, wants to kill Gohda and sends his ninja Onikage to cause terror in the land. Onikage and Rikimaru are rivals, having faced off several times, with Onikage being more of a demon and Rikimaru being more human. Mei-Oh is the final boss of the game, but Onikage persists in the series as the main antagonist.Towards the last mission, Gohda's daughter and Ayame's close friend Princess Kiku is kidnapped by Onikage, but rescued by the two ninjas. </div>  <div> Expansions and Versions : Following critical success, the game was re-released in Japan in 1999 as Tenchu: Shinobi Gaisen with updates including the levels found in the American version, different mission layouts, and notably, a mission editor where players could create their own levels.100 of the levels created through this in-game mission editor were selected in a competition from the game's original developer and released in November 1999 as a standalone disc called Tenchu: Shinobi Hyakusen. These missions, which included 22 secret missions bringing the total to 122, were not story-related, but did have levels focused on one mechanic, varying from elimination missions, to assassination levels, to escorting Princess Kiku.The Greatest Hits version of the game added the original Japanese intro movie. </div> "

To progress to the next level players are required to meet certain criteria e.g. 500 lives saved, 200 deaths. During the course of a level you may deal with; epidemics in which you need to keep under wraps from the health authorities; emergency patients who require immediate attention; impressing the hospital inspector and discovering treatment for a number of different illnesses.The PC version of the game contained a number of funky music trackswhich were left out of the PlayStation version.

The menus allow you to select from a range of different rooms for different needs. More rooms unlock as you progress through the game and will help you cure more illnesses, the rooms have different types of machinery to cure the illnesses. Each room requires a doctor or nurse with a certain qualification to operate it. The player is able to choose the size of the room as well as place doors, windows and various props inside the room to satisfy patients and staff. However, the bigger the room and the more props placed inside it the more expensive it will be and it will come out of your current budget. It is also possible to place staff rooms for employees to rest in and entertain themselves as well as toilets for patients to refresh themselves. Rooms will become dirty and fill with litter unless you employ a handyman to clean up all the mess.Often the player won't have enough space to fit all rooms that they need so they will have to buy more land which contains a separate building to place more rooms in, they will often find they have to buy 2 or 3 more buildings to have the required rooms.Apart from rooms and buildings it is also possible to buy props to make your hospital a more comfortable place to be. Firstly the player can buy a reception desk which is very important and they can also buy plants to make the hospital look nicer, radiators to make sure staff and patients don't get too cold, fire extinguishers to put out possible fires, benches for patients to sit on while they wait to see a doctor and vending machines for patients to buy a snack when they get hungry or thirsty. </div>  <div> Rooms : GP's OfficeRequires a doctorMinimum Size is 4x4General DiagnosisRequires a doctorMinimum Size is 5x5CardiogramRequires a doctorMinimum size is 5x4Requires Handyman for repairScannerRequires a doctorMinimum size is 5x5Requires Handyman for repairUltrascanRequires a doctorMinimum size is 5x5Requires a Handyman for repairBlood MachineRequires a doctorMinimum size is 4x4Requires a handyman for repairX-RayRequires a doctorMinimum size is 7x7Requires a handyman for repairPsychiatricRequires a psychiatristMinimum size is 5x5Also a treatment roomWardRequires a nurseMinimum size is 6x6Also a treatment roomMultiple patients may us at same time </div>  <div> Staff : PharmacyRequires NurseMinimum size is 4x4PsychiatricRequires a psychiatristMinimum size is 5x5Also a diagnosis roomWardRequires a nurseMinimum size is 6x6Also a diagnosis roomMultiple patients may us at same timeOperating TheaterRequires two surgeonsMinimum size is 7x6Requires a handyman to repairRequires a ward </div>  <div> System Requirements : InflationRequires a doctorMinimum size is 5x4Requires a handyman to repairDNA FixerRequires a researcherMinimum size is 6x5Hair RestorationRequires a doctorMinimum size is 4x4Requires a handyman to repairSlack Tongue ClinicRequires a doctorMinimum size is 4x4Requires a handyman to repairFracture ClinicRequires a nurseMinimum size is 4x4Requires a handyman to repairElectrolysisRequires a nurseMinimum size is 5x5Requires a handyman to repairJelly VatRequires a doctorMinimum size is 4x4Requires a handyman to repairDecontaminationRequires a doctorMinimum size is 5x5Requires a handyman to repair </div>  <div> Cheat Codes : Staff RoomMinimum size is 4x4Research DepartmentRequires 1 researcherMinimum size is 5x5One researcher per desk in roomToiletsMinimum size is 4x4TrainingRequires a consultantMinimum size is 4x4One student per desk in room </div>  <div> Open Source Versions : NurseThe player must employ a variety of staff to keep their hospital running.

The story revolves around two characters, Rue and Mint, which each have their own story but both quest for the same goal: the Dewprism, an ancient relic that can grant any wish, although each want the relic for different purposes. </div>  <div> Story : Threads of Fate distinguished itself at the time of it's release for it's separated plot that weaves and merge throughout the game as you follow the adventure of two very different characters, Mint and Rue through their quest for the same thing: The Relic. Created by a group of ancient and powerful magicians, the Relic is thought to be the most powerful artifact that ever graced the lands.For Rue, he wishes to revive his companion Claire. One night, a visitor (called the Arm of Death) came for Rue and killed Claire because was trying to protect Rue by attacking the Arm of Death.Mint's story is highly comical. Opening on a giant feast for the princess of East Haven Kingdom, she gleefully runs from table to table delighting in the food. When she discovers that pumpkins, her most hated food have been served, she throws a tantrum. Her sister Maya bursts into the room, and scolds her for her bratty, spoiled behavior. Maya informs her that she will be ousted from East haven Kingdom, and will no longer be princess.The two main CharactersLater, Mint hears of the Dewprism, and embarks of a quest to achieve omnipotence. Her goal is simple, to become princess again and ""make Maya scrub the toilet."" Hopefully, no pumpkins will get in her way! ""It's World Domination time!"" she declares.The story, though fairly simplistic, is impregnated with strong concepts such as destiny and fate, and the will to fight against it (Most of these elements are better shown on Rue's side of the story though). Rue's story has indeed a stronger narrative than Mint's, making him the character players will want to begin with. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game showcased the power of the PlayStation with some of the best graphics seen on the console.An action-RPG at it's core, Threads of Fate bears resemblance to titles like the Mana games and takes cues from platformers and action adventure titles such as Alundra and The Legend of Zelda. Simplistic in it's execution, imbued with a lot of mechanics from the Secret of Mana game (an example would be the return of the ring menu), the combat system proved to be the only lacking point of the game, it's strongest being the narrative.As with the story, the characters are played quite differently:Both Rue and Mint are able to take part in combat, with Rue being more action based and Mint being more magic based. Rue, with the special stone on his forehead, can transform into defeated enemies and use their powers to fight other enemies. There are a total of 24 enemies he can transform into, however, he can only transform into four at a time. When Rue defeats a fifth enemy, the oldest enemy disappears from his list of available transformations. When he is in his main human form, he can use his blade, the Arc Edge, to chain attacks and defeat enemies. Mint is skilled in magic and can use seven different types of magic with different elements and seven different effects of magic, ranging from a wide area effect to an extremely strong burst. Some effects can‚Äôt be used with certain magic, and with that being said, there are a total of 35 different combinations that can be used to attack enemies. Mint can also use her rings to chain attacks and she can use her kicks to defeat enemies as well.You will need to finish both sides of the game to know the entire story, though sadly only one dungeon per character is unique, the rest of the game being alterations of the same places. </div>  <div> Stat Raising : While ToF is an action RPG, there is no set-in-stone level up system. The only thing you can raise is your HP (Health Points), MP (Magic Points) Strength and Defense. For HP and MP, the way you can raise them is by using them. If you take damage, over time you will raise your max HP. When you use magic abilities, over time your MP will raise. You can also purchase potions from Hobbs that will raise your HP and MP by 10 points each. To raise your strength and defense, you can buy items from Tonio. Another way to raise your stats is by collecting the ‚ÄúLegendary Items.‚Äù You can find the Legendary Sword, Shield, and Helmet, which turn out to be a kitchen knife, a frying pan, and a pot, respectively. You can give these items to the bartender and he will make certain dishes for you, provided you provide him with a certain amount of monsters for him to cook. </div>  <div> Additional Info : Threads of Fate was more of a cult following than a big hit, mainly due to the fact that it was released extremely close to both Chrono Cross and Legend of Mana as a part of Squaresoft's ""Summer of Adventure."" The game was ended in such a way that a sequel is possible. Given the number of franchises Square has resurrected, many fans hope Mint and Rue's story continues. </div> "

In addition, the game introduces the cover system to the genre, in which players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire and hazards while automatically reloading their weapon. The cover system makes use of a large floor pedal (the ""Action Pedal""), which must be held down in order to get out of cover. To prevent players from abusing this system, players cannot fire their weapon while in cover and are timed (forcing players to take risks in order to not lose their credit). The game was sold in both standard and deluxe cabinets and is single-player only.Time Crisis includes three stages, each with a unique boss encounter. Along with the main Story Mode, the game includes a ""Timed Mode"" which limits the player to one stage (of their choosing) but grants infinite lives. The game received numerous sequels and spin-offs since its original release.The game was later ported to the Sony PlayStation in 1997 (June 27 in Japan, October 31 in North America, and November 30 in Europe). The Japanese and European versions also had a bundle with Namco's GunCon peripheral, which used an auxiliary button on the sides of the gun for the Action Pedal system. In addition, this version includes a bonus story mode (known as ""Special"") in which Richard must infiltrate a hotel (which is a front for a weapons factory) to hunt down the leader of the ""Kantaris"" syndicate. The Special mode features alternate paths and multiple endings.It was also ported to the PlayStation 2 as part of the 2002 Japanese compilation Gunvari Collection + Time Crisis. This version supports Namco's GunCon 2 peripheral. </div>  <div> Story : The plot of this game is that there is an attempted coup in the republic of Sercia. The Garo family had ruled Sercia for a millennium. But in 1995, the VSSE Interantonal Intelligence Agency sent William MacPherson, who was able to topple the Garo regime and become the first democratically elected president.Sheruda Garo, the last member of the Garo family, sought to recapture the throne from the new president, President MacPherson. Sheruda sends a mercenary to kidnap the president's daughter, Rachel. Garo tries to blackmail the new government by demanding military secrets in trade for the president's daughters life. If the secrets were not delivered by sunset or else Rachel would be killed. The VSSE decides to send an agent, Richard Miller (The Player), to infiltrate Garo's castle and rescue Rachel. After being sent into a trap, Miller discovers the real location of Rachel. He battles his way up Garo's castle to the upper levels and eventually finds Rachel. But as he attempts to rescue her, the mercenary, Wild Dog, captures her again and and drags her away. Miller pursues Wild Dog outside of the castle to their final battle point, a bridge. Wild dog begins to blow up the castle in a last ditch effort to escape. Miller is able to get Rachel and escape before the castle and WIld dog is engulfed in the explosion. </div> "

The video game shares many themes with the novel, including a heavy emphasis on terrorism and anti-terrorism, covert operations, and international politics. Rainbow Six has been ported to many consoles following its original PC release. Depending on the console, Rainbow Six is played in either a first-person or third-person perspective, allowing players to take the role of a covert anti-terrorist heading into action and giving commands to teammates in order to tactically defeat the enemy. The PC version was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment, except in Europe where it was published by Ubisoft.   </div>  <div> Story :  Team Rainbow is an elite international group of anti-terrorist experts, covertly sent on missions around the world in an attempt to smother out the flames of rising terrorism. The team is often assigned hostage rescue missions from director John Clark, during the course of which Rainbow is alerted to the actions of a radial terrorist organization the Phoenix Group. During several mission infiltrating the many bases of operation for the Phoenix Group, team Rainbow successfully gathers intelligence from the Phoenix Group‚Äôs biological research facility. It is revealed that the terrorist organization is planning to unleash a biological weapon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Team Rainbow immediately prepares to infiltrate the large underground network of the Olympic Village, seeking the location of the weapon, and thwarting the Phoenix Group‚Äôs plans. The Rainbow Team concludes it‚Äôs mission against the Phoenix Group by entering the group‚Äôs main facilities, resembling an ecosphere for botanical and viral research. Team Rainbow successfully incapacitates the enemy leader, taking out a major threat to world peace.   </div>  <div> Gameplay :  The gameplay in Rainbow Six forces players to strictly plan each mission, examining every tactical angle before thrown into action. Levels are prefaced with briefings that provide the player with a map of the area, suspected locations of terrorists and hostages, and entry and exit points. The player is encouraged to plot their own waypoints on the map, while choosing different alert status for the team (i.e, ‚Äúescort‚Äù or ‚Äúengage‚Äù). However, stock execution plans are available in the player chooses to bypass the planning stage. Four teams are at disposal to the player, one of which is in direct control through either first person or third person view. Sixteen individual members comprise Rainbow Six, each of which can be either promoted or assigned to different color coded teams, such as Gold, Red, Blue and Green. Once the mission has begun, players have access to the wide range of weapons chose during planning. For example, flashbangs temporarily debilitate enemies, which is the player‚Äôs advantage when approaching guarded hostages. The player also has the ability to advance other teams in the field, either by switching the control and view to a different colored team, or executing Go-Codes such as ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù or ‚ÄúHold Position.‚Äù When a team member of Rainbow is incapacitated by the enemy, vital signs display the status of the downed member. If a member has been killed, he or she will be unavailable for the roster for the remainder of the game. Incapacitated members must wait to recover at least one following mission before returning to action.   </div>  <div> Multiplayer :  Rainbow Six is notable for it‚Äôs online multiplayer during a time when internet gaming was in its early stages. Many maps were multiplayer specific for the PC, such as City Street Large, a training level.¬† Multiplayer on the console was limited to split screen co-op gameplay. Each player controlled one of the colored Rainbow teams, coordinating infiltration of dangerous areas and evacuation of multiple hostages.¬†   </div>  <div> Different Versions :  The Nintendo 64 version made use of nearly every button on the controller, forcing players to constantly switch between the middle and left handle. Aiming was controlled with the analog stick, for example, while reloading was designated to the left shoulder button. The Nintendo 64 version received both criticism and praise for this control scheme, as critics cited the layout‚Äôs awkwardness, while the positive reviews noted a parallel to real world actions. It was developed by Saffire. The Dreamcast version was developed by Pipe Dream Interactive¬†and published by Majesco.

As of the shutdown of Gamespy's servers on May 31st 2014, there is no longer any official multiplayer support for Rogue Spear. Rogue Spear also featured a ranking system called ladder play. Several websites provided this service throughout the game's lifespan, with the four most notable being Clanladder (CL), Xtreme Gaming Network (XGN), Starlance (SL) and International Gaming Syndicate (IGN). While all of these websites provided a ranking system, they also provided anti-cheat applications developed by the staff and community. More notably, SL and IGN both employed anti-cheat squads that would pose as players and monitor the playstyles of suspected cheaters. Their findings would often result in the banning and deletion of offenders from the ladder system.  </div>  <div> Game Modes : The game featured single player Campaign, Training, and Terrorist Hunt modes, and two online game modes: Team Deathmatch and 1v1. The game also featured a Replay mode, allowing players to save and watch clips of single player missions.  </div>  <div> Expansions : Rogue Spear's first expansion was released on April 4, 2000.

Tomb Raider is an action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics. It is a full reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise; the game's story, written by Rhianna Pratchett and Susan O'Connor, tells the tale of a young and inexperienced Lara Croft's first adventure. The game was developed by 80% of the team that worked on previous Lara Croft games and features a brand new engine dubbed the Crystal Engine.Tomb Raider's development was first announced by publisher Square Enix on December 6, 2010. Initially scheduled for Fall 2012, release was pushed after Crystal Dynamics received a directive from Square Enix President Yoichi Wada to make the best game that they could possibly make. It was finally released on March 5, 2013 to general acclaim. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like its precursors, the new Tomb Raider involves a mix of puzzle solving, platforming and combat in an open world environment. In terms of tone and mechanics, however, the game is more serious and realistic ‚Äì Lara does not dive in slow motion while using dual pistols with pinpoint lock-on accuracy, but rather takes cover behind the environment and eliminates enemies with a carefully aimed arrow from her bow. Unlike the typical franchise enemy roster, consisting largely of various wild animals, players' opponents in this game are almost universally human, with few exceptions. This decreased diversity is offset by an increased depth to the combat. Lara uses four different ranged weapons, each with its own unlockable upgrades, alt-fire mode, and out-of-combat utility. Upgrading weapons requires resources in the form of salvage which can be found in various containers throughout the island or by looting corpses. She can also use salvage to unlock limited close-combat capabilities, being able to dodge and counterattack, as well as perform executions on incapacitated enemies.Action-packed sequences abound.Tomb Raider's platforming follows in the vein of the Uncharted series, with cinematic set-pieces and dynamic features, as well as limited use of quick-time events. These set-pieces led to some initial negative publicity for the game (the first in the franchise to receive an 'M' ESRB rating), as failure frequently results in gruesome, fully-animated deaths, such as being impaled through the chin or crushed under a boulder. Increased control over jumps and the ability to scramble up walls, among other enhancements, make the platforming feel more polished mechanically than previously in the franchise. Puzzle-solving is also a more active process, as Lara must take into account variable elements such as fire, wind, and momentum. To aid her, Lara can activate her ""Survival Instinct"" at any time while standing still, which will highlight objectives, enemies, collectibles, and interactive elements.Base Camps allow Lara to fast travel across the island. These camps are also where the player upgrades Lara's skills and weapons. Use of fast travel is essential for getting all the collectibles, as many are hidden or blocked behind obstacles that Lara obtains the tools to overcome later in the game. These collectibles include journals from past island inhabitants and the Endurance crew, relics reflecting the island's legacy, and GPS markers which reveal hidden caches. They can be found through exploration, by use of Survival Instinct, or by clearing each area's tomb to retrieve the treasure map at the end. </div>  <div> Story : Don't look down.Travelling aboard the Endurance, Lara and her boss, archaeologist Dr. James Whitman, are seeking the ruins of the legendary island of Yamatai, which was ruled by the shamanistic Sun Queen, Himiko. Accompanying Lara is the Endurance's captain, Lara's mentor Conrad Roth, as well as her friend of Japanese descent, Samantha, who is fascinated by the story of Himiko. For Lara, the quest is inherited from her father, also an archaeologist, while for Dr. Whitman the primary appeal is as material for a TV series. Against Dr. Whitman's wishes, they follow Lara's hunch that Yamatai is to be found in the Dragon's Triangle, an infamously stormy and dangerous area of the ocean southeast of Japan. The Endurance is caught in a raging squall and shipwrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors soon encounter a band of homicidal madmen, and are split up in the ensuing melee. Most of the game focuses on Lara's journeys across the island to reunite with and rescue her friends, and find a way home. Early on, she manages to send an SOS message, and a plane arrives to evacuate the survivors. However, a freak localized storm forms and strikes the plane from the sky.Trial by fire.As she fights the hostile inhabitants of Yamatai it is revealed that they are a fanatical cult led by the ruthless and insane Father Mathias, who was stranded there in 1982. As more people are shipwrecked by the Dragon Triangle's storms, the men are captured, tortured, and indoctrinated into the Solarii, the warrior core of the cult. The women, however, can be found crucified and burned to death across the island in some twisted ritual. Lara eventually reunites with most of her companions, including Joslin Reyes, the mechanic, who is repairing an escape boat, but discovers that Samantha has been abducted by Mathias for a sinister purpose. Pursuing him into the island's ancient temple, Lara discovers that the storms that surround Yamatai are caused by Himiko's vengeful spirit, still trapped in her ancient corpse. Mathias believes if they offer Himiko a ""living successor"", she'll stop the storms and allow them to escape. However, the ritual for the transferal of power involves a trial by fire, which every woman thus far has failed. Samantha miraculously survives the trial, and Mathias takes her into the inner sanctum to continue the ritual. This angers the Guardians, magically preserved but mindless soldiers of Yamatai who defend Himiko's remains. Lara fights her way through both Solarii and Guardians to finally reach Mathias and Samantha in the midst of the transference process. There, Lara finally learns the secret that Mathias knew but she didn't. Namely, that Himiko was a sorceress who cheated death by stealing the bodies of young women as she grew old again and again; the last 'successor to the throne' learned of this ahead of time and poisoned herself during the ritual, so that Himiko's evil soul was trapped in the girl's dead body. Mathias intends to sacrifice Sam to Himiko, giving Himiko the living Sam's body, killing Sam in the process. Therefore, to save her friend, Lara kills Mathias (finally wielding her trademark dual pistols) and torches Himiko's body, sending the witch-queen to Hell once and for all.With the storms finally eliminated, Lara and Samantha escape with what few companions survive (only Reyes and Jonah, the galley master). They are picked up by a passing ship, and given the opportunity to go back home. However, traumatized by her experiences, Lara now believes that she is an adventurer at heart, and there are many more questions that need answering. She has become a survivor, and will go wherever she must to find answers. </div> "

A captured TIbetan monk, named Brother Chan, informs her that the ship carries an artifact, called the Seraph, which serves as the key to another artifact, called the Talion, which, in turn, is the key to Dagger of Xian. Chan also tells Lara that he is from an ancient order of monks who live at the Barkhang monastery and have sworn to protect the Tallion.

(originally released as Tombi! in Europe) is an action-adventure platforming game by Whoopee Camp for the PlayStation. Players take control of the pink-haired, primal Tomba on his quest to rid his land of the Evil Koma Pigs, which have mutated and warped the landscape and nature. At its core, Tomba! is an 2D platformer, but it differentiates itself from other 2D side-scrollers by having multiple planes, RPG puzzle solving, and 130 quests guided a unique missions system that reduces the game's linearity. The game was a critical success, but did not sell very well; it is regarded as a cult classic nonetheless.It was subsequently re-released via PlayStation Network in Japan in 2011 and in North America and Europe in 2012 (the latter being based in the US PlayStation version, hence retaining the original name ‚ÄúTomba!‚Äù, unlike previous European releases), as a part of the ‚ÄúPS One Classics‚Äù line ‚Äì a version which was ultimately compatible with PS3, PSP, and PS Vita. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A lot of the gameplay in Tomba! is that of taking missions from NPC's around the world and completing them. Over the course of the game players will do battle with a variety of enemy but the majority of the game will be spent fighting evil pigs. The most basic pig is the pink pig where all they have that can hurt you is a lousy old pitchfork, but later players will run into different types of pigs which can shoot fire, ice, and other elements. The fighting isn't all that complex, as players can just simply jump on an enemy's head and then that will make Tomba grab the pig. Once players have grabbed the pig they simply hit the jump button again to throw the pig, killing it. </div>  <div> Story : The first level of Tomba.Tomba is a eccentric young jungle child from a mysterious island. The Island that Tomba lives on has been invaded by The Koma Pigs and their evil pig followers. Using their magical powers, they transform Tomba's lands into a bizarre landscape. In the Opening for the game. Tomba attacks a number of evil pigs that are raiding a near by man's buggy. Tomba is knocked out during the scuffle and the pigs steal his Grandpa's gold bracelet.Tomba sets out on a quest to retrieve the bracelet, which requires vanquishing the 7 Evil Koma Pigs leaders. Trapping them involves finding Evil Pig Bags, keys to entering each realm of each Evil Pig. When Tomba confronts an Evil Pig, he can throw and seal them into their Evil Pig Bag. Along the way Tomba will help the other inhabitants of his island fight against the evil swine invaders to receive Evil Pig Bags and other key items. Some side-missions are purely for fun and irrelevant to the Evil Pigs storyline. </div>  <div> Reception : Even though Tomba! was received well by critics, it did not do well in sales. It never even reached Sony's Greatest Hits status. However it did gain a sequel, Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine, but Whoopee shortly went out of business afterwards. </div>  <div> Backwards Compatibility Issues Legacy and PSN Re-Release : Although many players enjoyed Tomba when it first came out, many gamers have been unable to properly play it since the original release. When the PlayStation 2 first came out, it was announced that it had complete backwards compatibility. All PlayStation 1 games were suppose to be playable on the new console. Later in its release, the PS2 was revealed to not be completely backwards compatible in that it could not play the original Tomba!. The problem was never fixed. The problem carried over to the PlayStation 3 as well.Due to legal issues surrounding the property, re-releases, reboots, or sequels proved troublesome. It was thought that the rights to Tomba! may be in legal turmoil forever, but in May 2012 MonkeyPaw Games announced that they had successfully acquired the rights to re-release the original Tomba! on PSN, and they did on June 19, 2012 in the US for $9.99. </div> "

At that point, Tomba can move in either direction the arrow points. Town areas in the game enable the player to explore them in a top-down view, allowing Tomba to move around freely.Tomba! 2 is mainly an adventure game with some platforming bits thrown in. The game that is the most analogous to Tomba! 2 is the Legend of Zelda. The game gives you a main story quest to go out and capture five evil pigs. These evil pigs all have different elemental affinities including fire, earth, water, ice, and ghost. These pigs are captured through the use of pig bags which not only capture the evil pigs, it also reveals the evil pigs' hiding spot. The game is actually so similar to the Legend of Zelda that the game has a final quest where it makes you backtrack through all the different towns to unlock the final boss.

Each quest usually involves solving a problem for somebody whether its collecting a bunch of crabs for somebody or helping out with an ancient ritual.The game doesn't have a whole lot of combat but it does utilize combat some parts.

The first game in the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brings real skateboarders (such as Tony Hawk and Bob Burnquist), signature skateboarding brands (including real skateboard decals), and easier accessibility into the scarcely-populated skateboarding video game genre.The game was ported to the Nintendo 64 on February 29, 2000 (ported by Edge of Reality and published by Activision), the Dreamcast on June 29, 2000 (ported by Treyarch and published by Crave), and the N-Gage on October 23, 2003 (ported by Ideaworks and published by Nokia). The Nintendo 64 version is known for its censorship of both blood and vulgar song lyrics (granting it an ""E"" rating by the ESRB, as opposed to the original ""T"" rating). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is included in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x for the Xbox and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).A separate game was released on the Game Boy Color on March 2000 (developed by Natsume and published by Activision) featuring elements from the console versions but focused on skating on a half pipe in a side angle (Half Pipe Mode) and racing opponents in an overhead angle (1on1 Vs. CPU Mode). </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, players control their skater as they participate in two-minute runs (one-minute for special ""competition"" runs) where they complete specific goals in that time (such as earning a large score count by performing tricks and collecting symbols scattered around the level). </div>  <div> Levels : Getting huge air off a ramp while performing a Grab Trick.Players steer their skater with the D-Pad and jump by pressing the Jump button. Holding down the Jump button while on the ground causes the skater to crouch down, increasing their speed. While in the air, they can hold down a direction on the D-Pad and either press the Flip button to perform a Flip Trick (simple tricks that can be easily chained with other tricks) or hold down the Grab button to perform a Grab Trick (tricks that can be held constantly for more points).Holding down a different direction on the D-Pad performs a different Flip or Grab Trick, which changes the point value of the trick (inversely proportional to the time required to execute the trick). Some advanced Flip Tricks can be held like Grab Tricks. If the player attempts to hit (or land on) a surface while a trick is in effect, the skater bails.Also, while in the air, they can spin around by holding left on the D-Pad, right on the D-Pad, or either shoulder button, increasing the point value (for every 180-degree spins) of the trick in effect (also adding points for simple jumps). However, landing with the skateboard in the wrong position causes the skater to bail.While in the air and close to a grindable edge (such as rails), they can press the Grind button to perform a Grind Trick (which lets them travel along the edge, earning points along the way). If they are close to a wall, they can press the Grind button to Wall Ride off the wall (earning points while increasing the skater's height). In both cases, they can press the Jump button to perform another jump. Pressing Up on the D-Pad and pressing the Grind button approaching straight on a halfpipe lip performs a Handplant.After a trick is successfully executed, they can perform another trick, adding onto the current combo chain (adding to the overall point value of the chain while increasing the chain's score multiplier). The score derived from the chain is added to the overall score counter if the skater lands successfully on the ground. The score is lost completely if the skater bails at any time. Extra points can be added to the chain by collecting special pickups, and hitting Gaps (hidden locational points reached by performing a specific jump, grinding specific edges, and interacting with specific objects).As the player lands more chains, their Special meter increases. Once the meter reaches its maximum capacity, the bar flashes yellow, allowing players to perform special Signature Moves (flashy Grab, Flip, and Grind Tricks that give a lot of points when successfully executed). When the bar is flashing yellow, it slowly depletes (and stops flashing yellow when the meter fully depletes). The meter fully depletes at any time when the skater bails.Holding Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Nollie, and double-tapping Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Fastplant, each adding points during the jump. Players can also perform a Nollie by pressing either shoulder button on the ground (switching their stance) and pressing the Jump button. </div>  <div> Playable Skaters : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater includes three single-player game modes (Career, Single Session, and Free Skate) and three multiplayer game modes for up to two players locally (Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE). Levels, skaters, and boards can only be unlocked by playing through Career Mode (or by cheat codes).Career Mode is the single-player campaign, as players lead one of the ten standard skaters (and two unlockable skaters) through all nine levels, unlocking new levels, skaters, and boards by collecting videotapes and winning competitions. Each standard level has five videotapes to collect, each by completing a specific objective in one run:Achieving the level's High Score.Colliding or grinding with five level-specific objects.Finding and collecting five letters (S-K-A-T-E) scattered throughout the level.Finding a videotape pickup somewhere hidden in the level.Achieving the level's Sick Score (which is larger than the High Score).Three levels ""competition"" levels, in which players are ranked (by score) in three one-minute runs. The best two runs are averaged out and compared against the competition, and the player wins by placing in the top three.Along with Career Mode, players can play Single Session, which are simple two-minute runs with the only objective of obtaining the highest score of each level, and Free Skate, which allow players to freely roam each level with no time limit or objectives.Two players can play competitively in three multiplayer modes: Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE. Grafitti and Trick Attack are split-screen simultaneous multiplayer, while HORSE is single-screen alternating multiplayer. In Grafitti, both players race against the clock to ""paint"" the level by performing tricks on objects. The player with the most objects painted wins. In Trick Attack, both players race the clock to achieve the highest score. The player with the highest score wins. In HORSE, players alternate ten-second turns to land a higher scoring chain than the previous one. If a player fails to land a higher score, then he/she gets a letter penalty and the required score resets.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,Neversoft,Activision,"September 20, 2000",ps,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater returns with new levels, skaters, gameplay mechanics (including the introduction of the Manual), and the ability to create custom skaters and levels.",3030-990,990,0,2000-09-20,https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/3030-990/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : New ground moves in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 20, 2000. Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the ""collecting videotape"" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from ""T"" to ""E""). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater. </div>  <div> Gameplay Enhancements : While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes. </div>  <div> Levels : Create-A-Skater editor menu.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create a skater, allowing the player to progress through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar or a custom-edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for this character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gapThe ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign. </div>  <div> Characters : The Park Editor's toolsetAlso a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the ""Manuals"" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash CollectablesCash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : HangarLocation: Mullet Falls, MontanaHangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.

The level is built around a volcano and if the player hops out of the level, an ominous voice (Most likely to symbolize God) either laughs at the player or proclaims ""You suck"" . In the Game Boy Color version, the volcano is absent, but there are different colored nebulas in the distance instead. </div> "
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3,Neversoft,Activision,"October 29, 2001",ps,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 brings the skateboarding franchise to the sixth generation of game consoles, bringing new levels, new skaters, new tricks (such as hidden trick variations and the Revert), and online multiplayer.",3030-5688,5688,0,2001-10-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Now you can skate with your friends!Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a skateboard stunt riding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2 (on October 28, 2001), GameCube (on November 18, 2001 as a launch title), and Xbox (on March 4, 2002).The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds a new roster of skaters and new trick types (including the ""revert"", a trick that can be executed to continue a Vert combo chain once the skater hits the ground). Career Mode has been updated (removing the currency system from THPS2) while the PS2 and GC versions support online multiplayer for up to four players.The game was ported to the PlayStation in October 29, 2001 (by Shaba Games), PC in March 28, 2002 (by Gearbox), Nintendo 64 in August 20, 2002 (by Edge of Reality as the last official release for the system), and Mac in January 2003 (by Gearbox). The PS1 and N64 versions run on a slightly-modified version of the engine used in THPS2, changing the levels to fit the memory capacity. Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 15, 2001 (developed by HotGen) and the Game Boy Advance on March 4, 2002 (developed by Vicarious Visions), both of which are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint.Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, this game features crossover characters from different franchises as playable skaters. Darth Maul (a Sith apprentice from the Star Wars franchise), Wolverine (a superhero from the X-Men franchise), and Kelly Slater (a surfer from Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer) are included as hidden unlockable skaters. The PC version of the game features Doom from Quake III: Arena (as Doom Guy).Some of the levels were later released as downloadable content in the 2012 downloadable game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD (for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The revert is a move that allows players to link vert tricks into a new or in-progress combo. It is a flatland trick that is performed immediately when landing off of a vert surface like a quarter-pipe or pool lip. The more times it is used in a single combo, the slower the player's speed will be when exiting the revert. To link vert tricks into a combo, a manual must be performed immediately after the revert animation. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Despite Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 featuring large, open-ended levels, THPS3 used it's current generation of systems' power to its advantage and brought the large-scale environments to life. Areas were now filled with NPCs, moving cars that would stop at obstacles, complex animated objects and real-time level shifting. Every level in THPS3 features a large or minor-scale change that can be triggered through the player's actions and either unlocks a previously hidden area or completely changes a part of the level altogether. These could either be part of a level goal or simply a hidden secret for the player to discover. </div>  <div> Levels : One other major addition to the game was the Trick Modifier system. This is a system that has been with the franchise since, although being refined in THPS4 and perfected in Tony Hawk's Underground. The trick modifier system are ""Hidden moves"" that can be performed by actions on the face buttons. For example, hitting the button combination for a kickflip while hitting the flip trick button twice will perform a Double Kickflip. Hitting it three times will perform a Triple Kickflip. Though THPS3 refers to them as Hidden Moves (An on-screen pop-up appears with a bonus score being awarded), they have become the standard in the series for performing modified versions of standard tricks. </div>  <div> Secrets : A breakthrough addition to the series is the addition of online multiplayer. This would later be refined in later entries of the franchise but the base concept remains the same. The game allows for up to 4 players in one lobby and drops them in a Free Skate session. The host then decides which game type will be played. The various game types can be found below. Players could either play through a Broadband connection or, on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, a dial-up connection. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features a wide variety of game modes thanks to the addition of Network Play. Some new, some returning from past entries. </div> "
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4,Neversoft,Activision,"October 23, 2002",ps,"The fourth Pro Skater game changes up the single-player structure, while making some tweaks and additions to the established skating gameplay.",3030-2101,2101,0,2002-10-23,https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4/3030-2101/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube on October 23, 2002. The fourth installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Pro Skater 3, Pro Skater 4 was the last main game in the franchise to bear the Pro Skater name until Pro Skater 5, adding new levels, skaters, and tricks (such as Flatland Tricks, Grind and Lip Trick Extensions, skitching vehicles, and Spine Transfers, which allow players to switch between connecting quarter-pipes or self-right themselves to exit quarter-pipes without bailing), as well as a new Career Mode system (where players skate around levels similar to Free Skate mode, and are given objectives and mini-games by talking with NPCs). A limited version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2's currency system returns (by completing objectives and special mini-games, as well as collecting cash pickups, players can buy clothes for the Create-A-Skater mode, decks, movies, cheats, secret skaters, and hidden levels).The game was ported to the PlayStation alongside the original release, and came to PC in 2003. The PlayStation version runs on a slightly-modified Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 engine, changing the level structure of most levels while replacing the Zoo, Carnival, and Chicago levels with two new levels: Sewers and Little Big World (the counter-tops of a giant kitchen).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Advance and the Zodiac in 2004. Both games feature a 2D isometric viewpoint, and carry over several elements from the console versions.As in THPS 2 and 3, hidden crossover characters are included: Jango Fett, a bounty hunter from the Star Wars franchise, and Eddie the Head, mascot of the band Iron Maiden. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core skating mechanics are mostly unchanged from previous games, but one major new feature is the spine transfer, which allows players to either switch to a ramp on the other side of a vert, level off when launched away from a ramp, or land correctly into a ramp if entering from a flat area.Also new to the game are pogo tricks, performed during manuals by tapping one of the face buttons. Depending on the trick, the skater will perform a handstand on the board or stand on the side of the board. Extensive use of the pogo system is effective during combos.The way goals are received is much different from previous games, adopting a sandbox-style system where goals are given by characters around the level. Completing a goal is rewarded with stat points that can assigned, and sometimes special trick slots. The game also reintroduces the concept of money, which was present in THPS 2 but not 3. Small amounts of money can be found throughout the level, usually by going up a ramp or grinding rails.Each skater, including the custom skater, has a unique ""end"" goal, which is often very elaborate. Completion of the goal nets a highlight video of the chosen skater, if using a pro skater. </div>  <div> Characters : Tony HawkBob BurnquistKareem CampbellSteve CaballeroRune GlifbergEric KostonBucky LasekBam MargeraRodney MullenChad MuskaAndrew ReynoldsGeoff RowleyElissa SteamerJamie Thomas </div>  <div> Levels : Eddie (Iron Maiden Mascot)Jango FettMike VallelyDaisy (Jenna Jameson)Little Person (resembles an Oompa Loompa - PS1 version only)Frycook (GBA version only)Mindy (GBA version only)Momo (GBA version only)Roger (GBA version only)In the game's Create-a-Skater mode, apparel can be unlocked to create Officer Dick and Ollie the Magic Bum from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : CollegeSan FranciscoAlcatrazKonaShipyardLondonZooCarnivalChicago (A level from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2) </div> "

A Game Boy Color port of the game was also developed by Tiertex Design Studios and the publishing of the port was handled by THQ. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Toy Story 2: Buzz Lightyear to the Rescue is a traditional style 3D platformer in which players take upon control of protagonist Buzz Lightyear as he attempts to rescue his best friend Woody after he is kidnapped by the evil Al McWhiggin.As is typical with the genre players have access to both a single and double jump and have to variations of attack to defeat the various enemies and bosses scattered throughout the game. The first form of attack utilises Buzz's wrist layer and fires a single projectile to damage enemies. This can be done from either the third or first person perspective as the game allows players to make precision shots from a first person viewpoint. The second of Lightyears' attacks is a spin attack to damage enemies with his pop out wings. Both of these attacks may also be charged resulting in a more powerful form of the attack although charging the spin move will leave players vulnerable for a short period of time after its execution. The game also features 5 different power-ups which are needed to help players complete certain tasks and these are permanently unlocked to be used in other levels once players recover one of Mr Potato Head's missing body pieces during the first level of each zone. The five power-ups are:Cosmic Shield - a shield which protects Buzz from damage and hazards in the environment.Disk Launcher - the disk launcher helps to defeat enemies in the harder to reach places.Rocket Boots - these give Buzz a speed boost for a short period of time.Grappling Hook - this allows Buzz to reach high places.Hover Boots - these allow Buzz to hover for a brief moment in order to reach specific platforms.Finally scattered throughout the stages often on harder to reach platforms are limited use upgrades such as a more powerful laser upgrade which increases the damage of the laser attack but comes with a limited amount of potential shots.The game contains 15 levels in total split into 5 zones consisting of 3 levels per zone (which follow the pattern of two objective based levels followed by a boss level). The gameplay centres around collecting Pizza Planet tokens to advance onto further levels in the game and although there contains five tokens per stage only one is required to progress onto the next level in the game and a set number of tokens being required in order to access the boss stage at the end of each zone.The five ways to unlock the Pizza Planet tokens within each stage are:Collecting 50 coins for Hamm.Finding 5 of Bo-Peep's lost sheep.Defeating RC Car in a race or completing Slinky's time trial challenge.Solving a puzzle or reaching a typically hard to reach location.Defeating a mini-boss within the stage.Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.As previously alluded to on the first level of each zone Mr Potato Head appears requesting Buzz recover a missing body part of his, rewarding the player with one of the five aforementioned possible power-ups for doing so. Obtaining these power-ups are essential to collecting all of the tokens within the game as several of the tokens are only obtainable using specific power-ups.Finally Buzz's dinosaur pal Rex provides advice and hints about the current level and tells players where in the level they can find the mini-boss to defeat in order to obtain the token awarded for doing so. </div>  <div> Levels : Example level select screen.Andy's HouseAndy's NeighbourhoodBombs Away!

The game then follows Buzz Lightyear and his companions as they set out to rescue the captured cowboy as the traverse the nearby neighbourhood, Al's Toy Barn, Al's penthouse and finally the airport terminal and tarmac at the film's end.Unlike the film however the game closes after Buzz Lightyear defeats Stinky Pete (aided by two henchmen) in a final battle, contrary to the films actual ending. </div>  <div> Differences Between Versions : There are many noticeable differences across the different versions of the game. This includes the game having a different soundtrack across the multiple platforms on which it was released. An example would be the first level of the game (Andy's House) which featured a unique soundtrack in the PS1, Dreamcast and PC release of the game. The N64 release though featured significantly different audio from the other versions of the game most likely due to the hardware differences between the various consoles. </div> "

Transformers: Beast Wars Transmetals is the name of two sci-fi 3D fighting games published by Takara in Japan and by bam! in North America:The Nintendo 64 version, known in Japan as Transformers Beast Wars Metals 64, which was developed by Locomotive and published both in Japan on October 1, 1999 and in North America on November 15, 2000.The Sony PlayStation version, known in Japan as Transformers Beast Wars Metals - Gekitotsu! Gangan Battle, which was developed by WAVEDGE and published both in Japan on December 9, 1999 and in North America on March 15, 2000.The final game based on the 1996-1999 Transformers: Beast Wars CGI animated series (after Beast Wars: Transformers), Transmetals is a 3D fighting game adaptation loosely based on the series plot (pitting the war between the Maximal and Predacon factions on Earth).Despite the similarities between both versions of the game, each version uses a radically different game engine and have different rosters. One notable gameplay mechanic similar in both versions is the ability to transform between multiple forms: Beast Mode, Vehicle Mode, and the limited-use Robot Mode.The N64 version is notable in North America for originally being a rental exclusive to Blockbuster stores. It is also notable in Japan for its Transfer Pak compatibility with Kettou Transformers Beast Wars (which unlocks Megatron X). Compared the PS1 version, it is also notable for multiple mini-games and character-specific endings (rather than faction-specific endings). </div>  <div> Characters : Both versions of the game have different rosters of characters, with only eight characters appearing in both games.

As such, more emphasis has been placed on expanding the single player experience through a unique story mode in addition to including a multiplayer component that had been missing from the previous game. Also, the game was published by Capcom for the home market; while the previous game  Steep Slope  Sliders had been distributed by  Capcom in  arcades, it was published by  Victor  and  Sega when it was released at home. With Capcom handling the home publishing duties, it was possible to include three Capcom characters as hidden bonuses within the game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Controls remain unchanged from the previous game; the player is able to independently rotate their snowboard from their character's turning by using the L and R buttons while the directional pad is used for turning/leaning and in helping determine which trick is executed. Again, there are buttons for jump, grab and flip.New to the game is a ten stage scenario mode where the player joins a film crew to record snowboard videos around the world. The player is required to hit certain types of stunts at specific points and/or is required to meet a certain point goal prior to the end of the run. At three points within the story, the player is approached by a challenger that must be beaten on the course just played. Challenges range from outscoring the opponent on the half pipe, getting more trick points for a single jump or simply racing to the bottom of a difficult course.Two player versus mode makes its first appearance in Trick'n Snowboarder, as well. Players can choose to play each other via horizontal or vertical split screen and if desired, via the Playstation link cable. All of the courses are available for any game mode, such as racing to the bottom or scoring the most points.  </div>  <div> Characters : There are three hidden  characters, each from  Resident Evil 2:Leon KennedyClaire RedfieldZombie   Throughout the Scenario Mode, the player runs into the following  characters:Ashley - Ran into in Russia  during the night time ""One Jump"" competition.Majagh - Competes  in Canada during the half pipe competitionJack - Races the  player down the X-Treme slope in Italy  </div>  <div> Reception : Despite Steep Slope Sliders' relative success with reviewers, Trick'n Snowboarder  faced a harsher reception. The previously lauded control system that reviewers called easy to learn was now considered by some to be awkward due to its differences from  Cool Boarders 3  and other snowboarding games on the market at that point. Gamepro said,  ""The controls take a bit to get used to"" in their review while  Gamespot reviewer Nelson Taruc more positively stated, ""This makes for highly fluid control, making the game very easy to play while giving it an accurate feel. At no point does the gameplay feel mechanical, which is a great plus"". </div>  <div> Legacy : Trick'n Snowboarder  would be the final Cave snowboarding game released in the US. Its successor, Snowboard Heaven remains a Japanese exclusive title and despite not resonating with critics or being particularly successful in sales, Trick'n Snowboarder has since developed a positive reputation amongst fans of Steep Slope Sliders who are only now discovering of the game's existance ( link).¬† </div> "

The Twisted Metal carnival of vehicular combat and destruction arrives in young Sweet Tooth's town, prompting him to enter into the tournament. This competition is held by the leader, Calypso, who promises ""any wish the victor could possibly desire"" as a grand prize. The cost of losing though, is the participant's immortal soul. Sweet Tooth creates his insane, clown-like persona and enters the contest. He soon rises to the top, and wins, in his machine-gun outfitted ice cream truck. Upon winning the contest, he enters Calypso's trailer and wishes to be ""the star of Twisted Metal."" Calypso grants Sweet Tooth's wish, which is used to explain his head of flames.

This is also the only level in story mode in which it is possible to fall to your death, but the cheat, hyperspace, allows for teleportation to random location on the map, escaping death. Super Auger uses a drill, mounted on the front of his vehicle, to impale enemies. Super Slam is basically just a bulldozer, and uses his shovel to pick up and appropriately slam down enemies repeatedly.Minion's Maze ( Minion) - A dark and complex maze which contains the same green flammable fuel found in the Amazonian level.

When she finally arrives, Lammy finds that her band has a new vocalist, Chop Chop Master Onion. By the end of the song, Lammy's guitar has suddenly become a vacuum and everyone in the audience begins to leave, which causes her to become distressed because she believes she is nothing without her guitar. Chop Chop Master Onion tells her of how he lost his dojo, but the dojo remains in his mind and it even had a casino, giving her the message, ""Dojo, casino, it's all in the mind. You have nothing to lose."" This teaches Lammy that her guitar will always be with her in her mind no matter what troubles she must face. This whole situation turns out to be a dream, to which she wakes up from only to find out she has 15 minutes to make it to the gig she just dreamt about. Thus Lammy dashes out the door to try to make it to her real first gig on time, keeping in mind the dream she had. </div>  <div> Stages : Teacher: Chop Chop Master OnionIn this dream sequence, Lammy arrives to her first gig to find that her band has a new vocalist, Chop Chop Master Onion, who teaches her that her guitar is in her mind. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Teacher: Chief PuddleOn the way to the venue, the path is blocked off by the fire department due to a huge fire from a pizza place. As Lammy tries to reason with Chief Puddle to let her through, he bargains with her that if she wants to go past so badly, she should help put the fire out. Lammy sees a nearby billboard for Joe Chin's Casino reminding her of the dream she had, which gives her the confidence she needs to help put out that fire. </div>  <div> Arcade Version : Teacher: Cathy PillarWith the fire out, the pizza place awards everyone with lots and lots of pizza. Everyone gorges themselves on the pizza, including Lammy. She eats so much, that she quickly becomes visibly bloated. She quickly recalls about her gig and rushes to the venue, still having a bloated stomach. She shortly runs into a large group of pregnant women and their husbands who are all going to a hospital. Unfortunately, nurse Cathy Pillar mistakes Lammy's bloated look as her being pregnant and takes her into the maternity ward. Shortly after, Lammy digests the pizza and her stomach shrinks. Cathy Pillar realizes this and suggests that Lammy at least help putting all the babies to sleep while she's here. Lammy sees some of the children playing with a roulette wheel, again reminding her of Chop Chop Master Onion's Dojo and Casino, giving her the determination to help calm the babies down. </div> "

The fighting, known in the game as Mayhem mode, took place in a 3D arena in a similar fashion to something like Power Stone, allowing for full free movement of the character. Pick-ups, traps, hazards, teleporters, bounce pads, and more filled each arena, with some characters being better suited to different stages.The strategy mode of the game took place on a hexagonal grid and was a simple turn-based affair where players could buy, move, and attack units, with the eventual aim being to destroy the enemy's base before losing your own. </div>  <div> Story : The game takes place on the planet Xsarra, upon which dwell the native, and mostly monstrous inhabitants, the Arcanes. Another race, known as the Teknos, consisting predominantly of cyborg warriors, crash-landed on the planet, and upon discovering its rich resources, instigated a war with the Arcanes for control of Xsarra. The war lasted over two decades, before a truce was formed between the two races, calling for peace and civility, and allowing both races to live together harmoniously, with only one rule: no Arcane may have a child with a Teknos, and vice versa. After a few years of peace, an Arcane male falls in love with a Teknos female. The couple do not procreate, but their relationship is cause enough for war to re-emerge on the planet.The game begins at this point, with the player choosing their side and attempting to win the war.The story is only really relevant in the Strategy mode, with the Mayhem mode having no cut-scenes or exposition of any kind, and allowing for the races to fight amongst themselves. </div>  <div> Characters : ArcanesBrontu - A large, slow-moving Rhino-like creature, with the ability to unleash a shockwave, a charge attack, and a toxic gas cloud.Prana Devil - The blue, reptilian creature seen on the game's cover.

Through her contact with a man who identifies himself only as ""Roper"", Stern realizes that their eventual goal is to take over Union City. As D'arci makes her way deeper into the criminal underworld and uncovers more information about the Wildcats, she discovers that the gang has connections to mayoral candidate Bane, as part of their overall plans to wage war against the UCPD. As a Wildcat riot breaks out, the UCPD largely manages to bring the city back under control, mostly through D'arci's direct intervention.The second part of the plot deals with a criminal investigation into a brutal murder.

First released in February 2000 for the PlayStation, it was highly praised by critics, and still has a devoted cult following.The game was produced by Yasumi Matsuno, led artistically by Akihiko Yoshida and musically scored by Hitoshi Sakimoto, the three of whom collaborated on several other acclaimed Square projects, such as Ogre Battle and Final Fantasy XII. </div>  <div> Story and Setting : Lea MondeThe game tells the story of Ashley Riot -- an elite agent called a Riskbreaker -- as he follows the trail of mysterious Mullenkamp cult leader Sydney Losstarot through the ruins of the fabled and magical city of Lea Monde. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay may be roughly described as combat-intensive dungeon crawling with deep weapon and armor customization as its primary focus (along with the occasional box puzzle and platforming sections). There are an intimidating number of elemental affinities and weapon types, a largely mysterious weapon synthesis mechanic, and combat that focuses on chaining attacks together with rudimentary timing. </div>  <div> RISK Combat System : The combat system in Vagrant Story is highly unique. On the press of the attack button, a wireframe sphere appears around the main character which represents the attack range he has with the currently equipped weapon. The player is then able to target the enemy's individual body parts which fall under this sphere. Attacking each body part can yield different results, as they can have different defense points and weaknesses.Note the weapon affinity changes in the lower-left corner of the screenThe game introduces the concept of Risk, where the player is free to create a chained attack combo for as long as they desire at the expense of an increased chance that a subsequent attack will miss. Using combo attacks activated by pressing face buttons at the designated time, the player can focus on specific limbs or the enemy in general while attacking to maximize damage output. The Risk system encourages a play style in which the player is careful to stop attacking after a few hits, subsequently giving the enemy an opportunity to attack, thereby balancing the game. It also offers the player an emergency last-ditch effort by allowing them to continuously attack an enemy without interruption if no other strategies appear to be effective.Complementing the chaining abilities are the defense abilities, which like chaining relies on timing. Pressing the allocated defense button precisely when the enemy's attack connects will activate the defense move which have varied results (such as reducing damage by half or reflecting damage) based on the ability allocated to that button.Another core aspect of the game's combat system is the concept of enemy and weapon affinities. As you use a specific weapon (ie., Short Sword) against a specific type of enemy (ie., Dragon), the weapon's effectiveness against that enemy type increases. Likewise, when using that same weapon against a different enemy type (ie., Undead), the weapon's effectiveness towards Dragons would be weakened. By the end of the game, most successful players will have specific weapons prepared for specific enemy types and will switch between them all as the situation requires. </div>  <div> Equipment Synthesis System : Vagrant Story features a synthesis system, which allows the dismantling and reassembling of weapons and other equipment that drops during the course of gameplay. Lea Monde contains six different workshops at which players can combine metals to make stronger gear. Crafting weapons is more in-depth, allowing for a higher level of dismantling and reassembling, while armor crafting mostly involves combining of gear to make higher quality versions, or new gear entirely.Managing affinities is a matter of life or death for AshleyThe order of material quality in the game goes as follows: wood/leather, bronze, iron, hagane, silver, and damascus. The quality of a weapon specifically is important, as it helps determine the amount of durability points (or DP) is available to a weapon before it will break. DP can be repaired as any of the workshops. Dismantling a weapon can produce various spare parts (blades, hilts, mace heads, etc.) to combine into new weapons. Each piece of the weapon will carry a specific material property of metal to it (including wood, although it is not a metal). Combining different materials, such as mixing bronze with iron, can increase the type of metal being used for the weapon.Gems can also be attached to the various weapons and armor you create which will give different attributes, such as piercing damage, blunt damage, and even stat boosts in strength, intelligence, etc. The gems generally drop from either the monsters in the world or become available after dismantling a weapon.Three rare weapons in the game are available after reaching 100% game completion and finishing the required tasks to gain possession of them. These weapons (The Hand of Light, Rhompaia, and Holy Win) contain some of the most powerful gems and metal combination possibilities in the game. The weapons are found in locked areas and require multiple playthroughs in order to unlock them. </div>  <div> Localization : Someone had a good thesaurusVagrant Story's Japanese-to-English localization was praised by critics. Headed by Alexander O. Smith, who would go on to localize Final Fantasy XII, the translation is flavored with Middle-English words and other stylistic details at a time before this type of effort was common in Japanese releases to other markets. This is in contrast to its Ivalice Alliance cousin Final Fantasy Tactics which, though released only three years prior to Vagrant Story, contains more of a direct translation with numerous grammatical errors. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Vagrant Story's music was composed by team Matsuno mainstay Hitoshi Sakimoto. The score is darkThe soundtrack was released as a two-disc set on March 8, 2000 in Japan and contains 55 tracks used in the game along with two remixes. The soundtrack was reprinted on March 24, 2006 and featured some remastering that was previously unable to be completed with the initial release. Some fans, however, have complained that the remastering affected the quality of the audio. </div> "

The player character and game's protagonist is  Lenneth, a Valkyrie under the service of  Odin and  Freya, who is awakened and tasked with recruiting the souls of strong-willed individuals to be trained as warriors to fight for Asgard at Ragnarok, Valhalla's prophesized End of the World. In the course of performing this duty, Lenneth will bear witness to the often-tragic final living moments of those whose souls she is tasked with securing. With each character featuring their own unique backstory, characters of all shapes, sizes and backgrounds are drawn together by a fate thrust upon them by the legendary battle-maiden Valkyrie, but will their combined powers be enough to save Asgard and Valhalla from ruin? </div>  <div> Story : As Platina, a pure innocent little girl, returns home after drawing water from the river she bumps into two strange men leaving from meeting with her abusive mother.

With hardly any thought, Platina and Lucian desperately run away with only the hope of finding a better life. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes as the two stumbled aimlessly into the Weeping Lily Meadow, a yawning field of beautiful flowers that exude lethal pollen. Platina inhaled the pollen and collapsed in the arms of Lucian, who barely manages to escape and survive. The soul of Platina is put to use by Odin, who casts her in the form of the battle-maiden Lenneth Valkyrie, his agent in the human realm. Thus begins Valkyrie Profile. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Lenneth Valkyrie wakes up on a weeping lily patch in  Asgard and she mulls the nostalgia as she proceeds to meet Lord Odin, who has summoned her. Ragnarok, the end of the world, has been long forthcoming and Odin fears it will finally soon arrive. With this in mind, Odin gives Lenneth the task of collecting  Einherjar to help Asgard in the upcoming war. Upon the issuance of these orders, Freya awakens Lenneth's powers and they descend upon Midgard, where the human world lies. </div>  <div> Version Differences : Performing an overkill attack on an enemy.Valkyrie Profile has three different endings. The ending earned depends on the difficulty level to which the game is set at its start, whether Lenneth accomplished certain tasks during the course of the game, and a pair of numerical values, the Evaluation Rating and the Seal Value. The Evaluation Rating, which starts at 100, represents how effectively Lenneth is executing Odin's orders and and will rise or drop based on how fully Lenneth completes her tasks assigned by Freya. The Seal Value, which also starts at 100, represents Lenneth's personal bond of obedience to Odin. It rises or falls based on specific actions in the game. The basic requirements for each ending are as follows:Ending C:  The bad ending, earned by failing to satisfy Odin's orders. This ending is very easy to get if the player simply blows off Odin and Freya's requests and plays through the game without sending any recruits to Asgard. This ending is triggered when the Evaluation Rating drops to zero, and can be acquired on any difficulty level.Ending B: The normal ending. If the player progresses through the game normally by following Odin's orders and does not meet the narrow requirements to activate the best ending, the game will end with a confrontation with Surt. Lenneth leads her army of Einherjar against the Vanir forces, seeking ultimate victory for Odin. Lenneth follows her orders dutifully, without striving for answers to the deeper questions about her own nature, Odin's, and why the gods are at war. This is the best ending the player can earn on the Easy difficulty level.Ending A: The best ending. If the player carefully guides Lenneth to reject blind obedience to Odin and explore outside her mission parameters while simultaneously meeting the necessary requirements of Odin's orders to keep him assuaged, Lenneth can break free from Odin's control and awake to the truth about herself, Odin, and what the gods' war is really about. If the player performs a very specific set of tasks and intently monitors Lenneth's Seal Value to ensure it is under 37 points at the end of Chapter 6, then, if the game is being played on Normal or Hard difficulty, the A ending path is unlocked, in which Lenneth pursues a destiny of her own creation and the final boss is not Surt, but  Loki. </div> "

The village is destroyed!Vanguard Bandits is fantasy turn based strategy game developed for the PS1 by Human Entertainment. It is very much a traditional turn based strategy game (grids and everything!).¬† Unlike other fantasy games, you actually fight in giant mechs that resemble knights in plate mail armor more than actual robots.¬† You play as Bastion and your choices effect the different turns the story takes and who you end up getting in your party. Different characters may be friends because in one storyline, and enemies in another. </div>  <div> Combat : Action!  V anguardbandits, as mentioned before, is a very traditional style turn-based RPG.¬† You have grid based movement/combat. You have an HP bar. Everything costs so much AP/FP.¬† Movement always costs AP. Combat costs you both AP and FP. Every attack has different costs for AP and FP.Your AP bar starts at 100 and drains whenever you attack or move. Some different terrains cost more AP to move over for different ATAC‚Äôs (the mechs of the game). A good example is how most ATAC‚Äôs are terrible at moving in sand except for a very specific one. It costs you way more AP to move and thus reduces your combat effectiveness when you have to move distances.Your FP bar is another story. It starts at 0 and moves its way up to 100. You really don‚Äôt want to reach 100 though, because then your ATAC gets ‚Äòfrozen.‚Äô This is shown by a little star floating in a circle around. Enemy ATAC‚Äôs will have a¬† 100% chance of hitting you if you are frozen, and there is nothing you can do! Different attacks have different FP costs. Some cost as low as 5. Others may cost you as high as 90! So make sure you watch that FP bar. Each and every attack in the game has a hit percentage that all depends on statistics. Your dexterity effects your accuracy. Your agility effects your ability to dodge said attacks. Before each combat animation, it will give you the choice to avoid, defend, counter, or just use an attack in response.¬† Let‚Äôs talk about the effects of each. Avoiding costs no extra FP and has the highest dodge rate.  Defending costs a little extra FP but weakens attacks considerably and lowers your dodge at the same time a large amount.   Counter costs a little extra FP and lowers your dodge rate. But you have a chance or parrying their attack and using your own.¬† You also have a chance of taking extra damage. It‚Äôs a risky move, but one that could pay off considerably.   Using your own attack costs the most FP (depending on the attack you choose) but is also the least risky. They do the same damage as if you‚Äôd avoid, but you do have a lower dodge chance. But your own attack has a good hit percentage too.  As a side note., some attacks have different hit percentage add-ons. Some attacks also have different ranges attached to them. This is shown when selecting any attacks. You also have something called  Skills which cost AP as well. Most of the time, these are used to 'effect' ATAC's. Whether it be lowering defense, healing, raising dexterity, etc... When your ATAC dies (or any ATAC for that matter) it flashes in a brilliant light that could only be brought to life by the power of the PS1 system. </div>  <div> Story : A big part of the game is deciding which ""elemental stones"" you will imbue your characters with. Some of the ATACs have their own special stones built into them that can't be removed or exchanged. These stones are usually more powerful than the average. Each element gives the chosen ATAC a specific move set. The different basic elements are:Wind - Has more range and accurate attacks Fire -¬† Lots of powerful and FP consuming attacks Water/Ice - Probably the weakest, there's some range attacks and effects attacks, but nothing super damaging Earth - Has some healing/range attacks  </div> "

By driving over a ski, aqua jet, or hover icon in a level a vehicle's tires will be replaced. Skis offer better traction over snow, aqua jets can drive over water without sinking, and the hover attachment enables a car to fly.Each stage in the game has a specific objective for each faction: a target must either be protected for the Vigilantes, destroyed for the Coyotes, or a non-destruction related objective must be met for the Drifters. Sometimes items must also be collected and delivered. As well all opponent vehicles must be destroyed. Almost every object in a level can either be destroyed or damaged by weapon's fire. Some will drop special weapons when broken, while others will change the level, such as the giant model doughnut on a cafe which will fall off and roll around the level after the cafe is destroyed, or bridges that collapse after being weakened.Destroyed vehicles drop upgrade points that increase a character's car's parameters; at 50 points in a stat the vehicle is upgraded with an accessory and at 100 in all four stats the vehicle is upgraded to a completely new design. </div>  <div> Characters: : Dallas 13Nina LocoMoloLord Clyde (unlockable)Obake (unlockable)Boogie (unlockable) </div>  <div> Levels : SheilaJohn TorqueFlying All Star TrioHouston (unlockable)Convoy (unlockable)Dave's Cultsman (unlockable) </div> "

Somewhere on other parts of the map are one or several opposing armies advancing towards you.There are many different types of squads and hero units with special abilities or spells that joins the cause over the course of the campaign.

It was one of the first games with full, 360 degrees rotation of the battlefield and had a fine (for it's day) mix of 2D unit sprites on a 3D landscape. </div>  <div> Plot : An experienced commander of a small mercenary force, conisting of a cavalry and infantry unit, Morgan Berhardt is at first doing his usual job - eliminating small time bandits and goblin warbands in the region of Border Princess and getting a tiny bit of gold for it. But soon he becomes a part of a bigger picture, as one of the powerful Skaven mages, grey seer Tuhanquol gives one of the Orc warbosses a powerful axe and uses him and his huge greenskin horde as a distraction to further his plans, namely - conquering the Empire. Berhnardt unwillingly becomes the main force foiling Tuhanquol's plans, at first accidentally, as his army grows bigger and stronger, and he employs the help of the Dwarves, the Elves of Loren Forest and the Emperor Karl Franz himself. </div>  <div> Game Mechanics : The game is divided into two parts - the tactical battles which form he core of the gameplay and the map view of the Old World, where the player can choose his next mission, hire additional mercenaries and replenish his losses.The tactical part of the game sought to apply the rulesets of the tabletop wargame, Warhammer: Fantasy Battles in a real time strategy context. At the beginning of each mission you select a number of units from your reserves to send into battle. Units are hired with gold, their cost based on the unit's size, strength, and skill level. There's also a constant retainer cost just for keeping a unit in the army. If your gold reserve is depleted you will no longer afford to hire the essential core unit, and the game will end. Once units are selected, most missions allow you to deploy your army however you wish, though some feature an ambush and you can only determine the marching order of your army. Some missions feature no battle at all, and any money spent to employ units is wasted. When the start button is pressed a peal of thunder is heard and the battle commences. You can then select and give orders to units on the battlefield. There are a variety of roles each unit can perform in combat: shooting ranged weapons, charging into melee, casting spells, and using magic items. During combat, the player is able to spur a unit to fight harder, at the cost of his attention to the rest of the battle. Many of the concepts of morale, and flank attacks are features of the tabletop game. As a result, a player that has not encountered the tabletop iteration of Warhammer may have issues with these concepts at first. A mission can turn badly quite suddenly when a single bad ""round"" of combat can result in the player's elite cavalry fleeing from a unit of pitiful goblins. </div>  <div> Difficulty : The learning curve of this game can be steep. The beginning has small battles with few units, though even those can turn nasty quite quickly. Replacing casualties in a unit costs money, and is always limited. Some locations may not offer any replacements at all, while some may offer only 10 across the your entire army. Even worse is that if a unit is completely destroyed it is usually gone for good, which includes the rare, valuable, and fragile wizards. As the game progresses the difficulty of individual scenarios and the overall situation compounds. The player gains more units and battles get larger, but you can't pause the game to give orders. It will often be necessary to manage multiple wizards, target ranged units, launch charges, and set up flank attacks in very short spans of time. It's easy to end a battle successfully and only then notice that a key mortar was destroyed in combat, requiring a restart.As a result of a difficulty so hard, that even the experienced RTS players had a tough time finishing the game, many of the game's more painful elements, like the retainer cost, the constant need for attention for every single unit and clunky interface were changed in it's more aproachable (yet still very hard) and more succesful sequel, Warhammer: Dark Omen. </div> "

Though the player begins as a bare soldier armed only with a combat blade and pistol, he can jump into an assortment of land-based vehicles, turrets, as well as the titular Warhawks, which are essentially futuristic harrier jets, able to switch between a hover and a forward-thrust mode. The game includes Sixaxis support when piloting a Warhawk, though you can also opt for traditional, analog-stick-based controls. There are six match types in Warhawk: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Zones, Hero and Collection.The game is divided into two different factions the names of the factions are Eucadians and the Chernovans. Each have unique uniforms and vehicle designs for each, gaining experience and leveling up unlocks different uniforms and designs for vehicles, as well as various insignia that are displayed on different parts of the player and their Warhawk / Nemesis.¬† ¬† </div>  <div> Weapons in Warhawk¬† :  Assault¬†Rifle- Shoots very fast but does little damage when far away.¬† ¬†RPG- Shoots¬†missiles¬†and also allows you to lock on to Warhawks and take them down.¬†  Pistol- You always have the pistol when you spawn good weapon for close combat situations. It also has infinite ammo.  Knife- This weapon kills anybody in 1 hit if you manage to hurt somebody with it.¬†¬†  Mines- Lay these on Warhawks or Vehicles and be ready for a pretty explosion. These explode on proximity.  Binoculars- These handy little¬†weapons¬†are used for ""air strikes"" you paint whatever you want to¬†air-strike¬†and seconds later the¬†air-strike¬†will happen.  Sniper Rifle- use this weapon for very long range shooting. This is the only weapon in the game that you can aim with-press R3 to zoom in, and press it again to zoom it further.  Wrench- You can use this weapon to heal your troops vehicles or your own. You can also deal damage to the opposing teams vehicles if you hit their vehicle with the wrench.  Health mines- These devices have a spray that heal your team if they are close enough to the mine, or they hurt the other team if they get to close to the mine.  Flamethrower- This weapon can be very deadly to anybody to close to the flame and is very handy for taking care of enemy vehicles. </div>  <div> Vehicles in Warhawk :  Tank- Very slow but very powerful. This vehicle is mainly used to defend bases or just steam roll through another teams base. The front of the tank shoots a shell that explodes on impact damaging or even hurting anybody around the¬†explosion. Also if you are very accurate if you hit a Warhawk with a tank shell it will automatically be taken down. Jeep- These little cars are used to move troops across the map. The jeep has a 50¬†Caliber¬†turret¬†on the back which can damage other ¬†vehicles and players.¬† Warhawks- These vehicles can be very deadly in the right hands. Warhawks are what this game is all about. They are very fast and can deal massive amounts of damage with all the weapons they can carry. They are fragile so watch out for RPG's or tanks before flying to¬†close¬†to other players. ¬†APC- Included in Operation Broken Mirror. The APC is a large ground based transport unit that can also serve as a mobile spawn point. The APC has no weapons, but includes a deployable shield generator that units on the outside can not shoot through. However, the generator can be short circuited by a fully charged lightning gun. If you spawn into to APC you are awarded a random weapon. The APC also has a charge move that will cause it to accelerate forward at high speeds. The charge move can damage and destroy ground units. Jeep in one hit. Tank in two. Ect.. ¬†Dropship- Included in Operation Omega Dawn. The Dropship is a air based transport and attack unit that can carry people as well as jeeps. The Dropship has two flight modes similar to the Warhawk: a hover mode were it can fire weapons and a flight mode for faster travel. For each teammate that is traveling in the Dropship another rocket turret becomes controllable. This makes a fully loaded Dropship a powerhouse. The pilot of the Dropship can also control side mounted guns while in hover mode. If you fill a Dropship with players you will receive a trophy.¬† ¬†¬†¬† ¬† </div>  <div> Weapons for the Warhawk and Dropship : ¬†¬† Aside from your normal machine gun turrets, the Warhawk and the Dropship can obtain weapons which are in the air for more damaging effects to air-based strategy/choke points, turrets, bases, or even enemy Warhawks. ¬†Swarm Missile-You start off with 5 of these when you are within a Warhawk. Multiples of these can lock onto an enemy Warhawk, but they don't do very much damage. They also don't lock on very well and can be evaded fairly easily. However, they are great for applying constant pressure in dogfights. ¬†Homing Missile-These are insanely strong missiles that are much harder to avoid. These are brutal. ¬†Air Mines-Like mines, but in the air. They're pretty easy to see, but can ensure that your opponent does not get to a specific point in the map. Also can be hidden in clouds, and be careful! They can blow you up as well.¬†Lightning Bolt-Lightning bolts are one of the most deadly things to use on your opponent's base. You get 10 ammo, but you can shoot one charged burst by holding R1. This makes the lightning bolt last for a while, destroying anything within its radius.Stealth-Stealth makes you-almost-invisible. You can still see an outline, but unless you are an idiot, they shouldn't be able to see you. Perfect for getting behind your enemy. ¬†TOW Missile-Missiles that you can direct and have a pretty large blast radius. Perfect for getting rid of choke points and bases from afar. ¬†Cluster Bomb-Little bombs that bombard the ground below and blow up. Great for objective based games like Capture the Flag, since you can stop them in their tracks from way up in the air.¬† ¬†Flak-Gets rid of any incoming locked on missiles. Useful for getting out of a hairy situation.¬† </div>  <div> The points system : During a round you earn 3 types of points: Combat, Team & Bonus. Combat points are earned for killing the enemy. Team points are earned for non-combat activities like capturing bases. Bonus Points are earned via the¬†Ribbons received in a round.   </div>  <div> Rank System : Warhawk features an in-game ranking system based on the points accumulated during online matches, and a few other requirements, including obtaining certain badges and ribbons.  </div>  <div> Additional Content :   </div>  <div> Trophy Support : [Update] A Warhawk room has been released early this year in which players launch a game from.  </div>  <div> Soundtrack :  Warhawk has been supported with additional content, including Maps and new vehicles. Two booster packs have been released so far (as of end of July 2008) with a rumoured third booster pack currently in developmentOperation Omega Dawn - this booster pack includes one massive new map and introduces the Dropship, which enables you to carry passengers and carry a vehicle around the map.

Warriors of Might and Magic,The 3DO Company,The 3DO Company,"February 7, 2000",ps,"Warriors of Might and Magic is an action role-playing game developed by 3DO. Step into the shoes of Alleron, a soldier framed for a crime he didn't commit, and seek to discover the truth behind this conspiracy.",3030-3030,3030,0,2000-12-22,https://www.giantbomb.com/warriors-of-might-and-magic/3030-3030/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Published and developed by The 3DO Company, Warriors of Might and Magic was released for the Playstation, Playstation 2, and the Game Boy Color. Each version was essentially a different game, though they all follow a similar storyline. All three versions star Alleron, a guard captain accused of necromancy. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Warriors of Might and Magic follows a traditional route of Action RPG gaming. Players start in a hostile environment from the start, and are given their first equipment and spell at the start. The game requires caution, and wise use of health potions, as they are the only means of recovering hitpoints.There are of a variety of weapons, shields, armor and items, all with different elemental bases and effects.Combat itself takes place in a real-time fashion, allowing players to dodge, guard and counter-attack as they see fit. With 27 available spells total, Magic also plays a key role in battle, and it may be used for anything from slowing an opponent, to buffering your own strength and defense, to causing a foe to fight for you. From summoning an army of phantoms, to burning your enemy to a crisp, to increasing your speed for a short time. There are many different spells to choose from, and they all have their uses. Like in most RPGs, players gain experience by defeating enemies. Upon leveling up, players may distribute points to their attributes as they see fit. Alleron's stat categories are as follows: Might, Speed, Intelligence, and Endurance.  The Status Screen at level-up.  Might - helps to determine Alleron's total attack rating. Speed -determines Alleron's movement speed and attack speed. Intelligence- determines the effectiveness of spells, as well as Alleron's total mana points. Endurance- determines Alleron's total hitpoints. </div>  <div> Story (Spoilers) : The game opens with Alleron on trial for necromancy. This seems to be a formality, rather than a real trial, as sentence is passed right away. The Inquisitor places a cursed mask called ""The Mask of the Accused"" upon Alleron's face to mark him as a necromancer. The mask seems to take a life of it's own, driving claws into his neck so that it cannot be removed. Alleron is then cast into the Pit of the Accused, and the game starts immediately.Alleron must escape the arena area they have been thrown into, and through a series of prison cells and sewers that are crawling with monsters and undead creatures. From here, it is up to the player to escape the Pit, and reach the outside world. Apok  Along the way, he meets and rescues an orc named Apok from the undead, and Apok in return helps Alleron by giving him a magic ring, and later aiding him in escaping the Orc Mines. This leads him into a ravine, where he meets a talking raven named Carlon that has somehow had his feet magically trapped in a rock. The raven agrees to help Alleron remove his mask, if he will find a potion to dissolve the stone. Alleron meets Carlon the raven.  Following the ravine floor, Alleron finds himself in the orc-populated Village of Draklor, which holds even greater dangers. Draklor, the new orc chief, is preparing to have the old chief killed as per some kind of tradition. The old chief's wife is distraught and asks Alleron to save her husband, which he does. Though grateful, the reunited couple then asks that you recover their food. Draklor has taken all they had to eat in order to celebrate. Alleron once again rises to the occasion and confronts the cruel orc chieftain, managing to slay him. Alleron uses the potion to free Carlon.   The old chief and his wife are extremely grateful and tell him about a way out of the ravine. In a small cave near the top of the cliffs, Alleron finds a potion that can free the raven, and in return, the bird directs him to the Monastery of Enroth. At the monastery, Alleron meets a monk named Saelo, who introduces him to his apprentice, Daria. Though he mentions the quests of Enroth, but insists that he cannot help a known necromancer. As Daria leaves the room, he slyly directs Alleron's attention to a tapestry saying ""For example, I could not direct ones attention to this map, detailing the first Quest of Enroth."" Alleron then makes for the site detailed on the map.  After battling countless gargoyles and golems, Alleron has both the Red and Green Gems of Enroth in his possession. We then see Daria speaking with The Inquisitor, and complaining that Alleron is still alive. The Inquisitor mentions a prophecy and says it forbids her to kill Alleron. Daria retorts that she would never bloody herself, and The Inquisitor assures her that so long as Alleron wears the Mask of the Accused, his mercenaries can kill him, but Daria does not seem convinced. Passing through a magic gate requiring both gems to pass, Alleron finds an ancient tome revealing a startling secret: It has been foretold that only a child of Einar, one of the immortal ancients, could complete the Quests of Enroth. It begins to foreshadow Alleron as the world's guardian, and a son of Einar. The book also states that the children of Einar cannot kill each other. Upon his return to the surface-level of the Monastery, Alleron finds Saelo preparing to leave. He questions the monk, and Saelo replies that he is planning to go to the City of Magic, a dangerous trip to be sure, and that it is there that the magic vial exists that can be used to remove the Mask of the Accused. Alleron offers to go in his stead, leaving Saelo to marvel at his bravery, and to question if he might truly be the ""one"".  After battling his way into the City of Magic, Alleron meets a wizard who aids him in passing through a magical doorway in exchange for finding his rune and scroll. In the next chamber, he finds the potion he was sent for, the one that can finally remove the Mask of the Accused. However, to his surprise he also finds Daria. She blasts the entrance to the chamber, making it impossible for Alleron to return the way he came. She chuckles, telling him he must now travel through the Maze, and the lair of the dreaded Talinthraxus, a dragon who is under her control.  The helpful coyote. Arriving at the maze, Alleron finds his way through with the help of a mysterious coyote. The coyote also leads him to people who have been imprisoned in the walls by dark magics. After fighting through and navigating the maze, Alleron comes face-to-face with the ""Minotaur Twins"" who are to blame for the trapped people (they also guard the exit). Stronger than the dozens of minotaurs he has already faced in the face, Alleron manages to overcome them, and returns to the people to find they are free. He then proceeds to the lair of Talinthraxus, parting ways with the helpful coyote. The mighty dragon proves to be a powerful adversary, but Alleron defeats and slays him, finally escaping the City of Magic. As he arrives at the Monastery of Enroth, it is immediately apparent something is wrong. The entire Monastery has been overrun by the undead! A surviving monk explains that Daria has betrayed them and summoned the undead that are laying siege to the once peaceful place.  Alleron manages to kill all of the undead in the Monastery, and he goes to find Saelo. Saelo then explains that Daria is one of the offspring of Einar, and that she was placed in his care. He had tried to turn her from her ways, but to no avail. Daria had dabbled in witchcraft in its darkest form: necromancy. He explains that everything that has been happening has been according to prophecy and that now, according to prophecy, Daria will attempt to resurrect Daglathor, an evil spirit creature who was sealed away in a volcano by the Ancients.  According to Saelo, it is foretold that only Alleron can stop Daria. He then hands Alleron a potion, commanding him to drink it. As he does, he looks into a mirror, seeming to come to the realization of who he really is, a son of Einar. He then removes the mask, leaving scars in his neck where its claws had dug into him. Saelo tells him to keep the mask, and that it will ""bring him luck"", and then sends him to the Temple of the Depraved. </div> "

Warzone 2100,Pumpkin Studios,Eidos Interactive,"May 31, 1999",ps,Rebuild mankind out of the ashes of nuclear winter as you attempt to recover pre-collapse artifacts and discover the true cause of the nuclear devastation.,3030-17004,17004,0,1999-04-10,https://www.giantbomb.com/warzone-2100/3030-17004/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Released in 1999, Warzone 2100 was one of the first RTS games to be truly 3D. Rather than being merely an aesthetic feature, Pumpkin Studios used the game's 3D engine to allow modular unit customization and terrain features such as lines of sight and mortar arcs. Thousands of unit combinations are possible as players can create everything from heavily armored VTOL aircraft to lightly armored hover-tanks with command sensors allowing them to direct other units. The game features a single-player campaign where base and units are retained from one mission to the next. In order to prevent players from simply amassing an unstoppable force as a result of this the majority of missions have a timer. This proved to be one of the main points of criticism however as a single enemy unit left on the battlefield could cause the player to lose a two hour mission if they ran out of time - no small matter when the PlayStation and pre-patch PC versions only allowed the player to save between missions.  </div>  <div> Plot : On November 3rd, 2085 the NASDA satellite system, designed to be the ultimate nuclear deterrent, misfired in an apparent malfunction. Every major city on earth was obliterated causing a world-wide nuclear winter. A year later a small group of survivors fight off bands of marauders and make their way to an abandoned military base in the Rocky Mountains. There, using the old military technology, they begin the Project, a group designed to rebuild civilization. In 2100 drop ships are dispatched to several sites in an attempt find technology from before the collapse. Team Alpha are dispatched to Arizona; there they initially encounter only disorganized scavengers but as they set up a forward base and discover pre-collapse technology they come into contact with the New Paradigm, a military survivalist group intent on seizing control of the desert. However, the New Paradigm end up simply being a provincial nuisance compared to the other groups awaiting the Project in the cities and mountains of a post-apocalyptic America.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game begins with the player in charge of Team Alpha in the Arizona Desert. First the player establishes a base and constructs oil derricks from which the game's only energy currency is derived. As the player takes on scavengers artifacts are recovered and new technologies can be researched. These allow units to be build with the usual assortment of machine guns and rockets but there are also sensors such as the commander turret which allow more advanced strategies to be used. The commander turret can have units assigned to it which will follow its commands and it can also act as a rally point for new units, avoiding the need to ferry units between the main base and the front line. Units assigned to a commander unit share its experience level which would normally take thousands of kills to amass.  Team Alpha fight the New Paradigm in an attempt to recover cyborg technology. The second mission sets the scene for much of what is to come as the mission timer is introduced and the player is asked to load a drop ship with units from the first mission to explore a separate map away from the player's base. The missions that follow alternate between base development and defense as the existing map is expanded and these off-site missions which usually involve scouting and then assaulting an enemy base. Base defense offers almost as many options as unit creation; towering lines off hardcrete walls can be created with machine gun bunkers in front and artillery units behind guided by sensor and counter-artillery towers. The game features a sprawling research tree in which a concept is researched from an artifact before branching practical applications can be researched. Thus researching a heavy cannon allows the player to then go on to research a heavy cannon turret for a tank and a heavy turret emplacement. Multi-player in the PC version supports up to eight players and allows players to specify technology levels and even pre-design a list of units so that custom units do not have to be created from scratch for each new game.Along with the base defense and sensors, the game has a heavy focus on long range artillery, some of which can reach across the entire map, similar to Total Annihilation's high tier artillery. Artillery emplacements can be coupled with sensor towers to automatically assign targets based on the type of sensor (regular ground sensors will target incoming enemy units, while counter-artillery sensors would determine the origin of enemy artillery fire and return fire), and can also be assigned to commander units, which are self-contained control groups that can handle both repair and construction of new vehicles and artillery support independently.  </div>  <div> Factions : The player takes on the role of a commander as part of the Project and is given mission briefings by an unnamed female narrator. Although the ideology of the Project is never made explicit its main goals are to attempt to rebuild humanity and find new technologies.  </div>  <div> Open Source release : The New Paradigm are a survivalist group based in the Arizona desert who are using synaptic link technology to create cyborgs in an attempt to become the dominant force in the region.  </div> "

Each backstage area is connected with another one, so the player can travel through every area in a match if so desired. Each room has several weapon crates which the player can smash to reveal more damaging weapons than the ones already at the players disposal.The Truck Arena - 1 Room - Fire HazardThe Loading Bay - 2 RoomsThe Locker Rooms - 2 RoomsThe Bathrooms - 3 RoomsThe Block - 2 Rooms - Fire HazardThe Media Center - 2 RoomsThe Parking Garage - 2 Rooms </div>  <div> The Game Modes : Backstage Assault features the following game modes.Exhibition: This is a standard exhibition mode: you are given the freedom to choose where you fight, who you fight, and the rules by which you fight, allowing you to fight to your heart's content. Some of the options include: first blood, the person who cause the opponent to bleed first wins; human torch, the first to set their opponent on fire wins; and the option to have pins and submissions count, or not.Hardcore Challenge: This is the game's main mode, similar to an arcade mode seen in most fighting games. The idea is to battle your way to a championship title shot by fighting a different opponent per backstage area. Once everyone has been beaten, the title match is unlocked. The championship belt corresponds to the difficulty, Hardcore Championship being easiest, U.S Championship being normal, and the World Championship being the hardest. Throughout the mode, the player can complete certain requirements in a match to unlock additional wrestlers and moves. Completing each difficulty rewards the player with one of three unlockable backstage areas, The Block, The Media Center and The Parking Garage; the latter being the hardest to obtain. Once completed, the player's score -- which is shown at the end of every match courtesy of a score breakdown -- is entered into the ""Hall of Champions"". The player also recieves attribute points at the end of the Hardcore Challenge.Hardcore Gauntlet: Described in the game as ""only for experts"" the Hardcore Gauntlet is a more advanced survival mode, facing 7 opponents in succesion with little time for breathers, meaning no stamina is replenished, and no re-tries. Once defeated, the player has to start the whole thing all over again. Some of the better unlockables are obtained through the Hardcore Gauntlet. Speed and efficiency are the key to winning here. </div>  <div> Commentary : WCW Backstage assault features commentary from Tony Schiavone and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan. The lines of commentary are mostly recycled from WCW Mayhem, with a handful of new lines to fit accordingly with the game's unique setting and location. </div>  <div> Reception : At the time of release, Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann, then at Gamespot, awarded the game a 5.1, citing a lack of variation as its downfall. David Smith of IGN was even less favorable, scoring it a 2.0. The PS1 version has a 40 rating on metacritic, while the N64 version has a slightly better 48 rating. </div> "

Wild Arms,Media.Vision,Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.,"April 30, 1997",ps,"Wild Arms tells the tale of a treasure hunter, princess, and dream chaser on a quest to save the world of Filgaia from the invasion of the metal demons.",3030-2222,2222,0,1997-04-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/wild-arms/3030-2222/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The beginning of this long-running franchise was overshadowed in its day, much in part to  Final Fantasy VII's dominance in the domain of Playstation RPGs. Nevertheless, Wild Arms is a solid RPG. It's rather unique in that it employs both 2D and fully-3D environments; towns and dungeons are presented in glorious 2D fashion (reminiscent of  Chrono Trigger and the SNES-era  Final Fantasy games), while the battle engine is presented in fully-rendered 3D. It plays out like most other RPGs of its time: fully turn-based, plenty of dungeon-crawling and item-collecting, and a ""teenagers save the world"" story.The three characters start out on separate paths and it's your job to unite them. Each has an introduction chapter that lets you get to know them. You find  Jack the treasure hunter deep in ancient ruins, searching for something to help him become stronger.  Princess Cecilia, the mage of the group, is studying magic at a secluded abbey and begins to learn the true meaning of her bloodline.  Rudy, the rogue who has the ability to wield the ancient relic machines (also known as ""ARMs""), is trying to find his place in the world by helping out in the village of Surf. Fate brings them together, and a good forty hours of gripping storylines and crazy plot twists await. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  An early boss battleThe main distinction Wild Arms has from its contemporaries is its heavy use of puzzles in dungeons. Each of the party members can acquire up to four tools that help solve these puzzles and progress further and including a  lighter to start a fire and a  grappling hook to cross gaps. It gives the dungeons the feel of an adventure game in the vein of  Legend of Zelda or  Alundra in that it requires some puzzle-solving skill. The combat in Wild Arms plays out like many turn-based RPGs of its era, it features a force system that is similar to limit breaks. Of note is the auto-battle command which has the AI take your turn for you. You can adjust whether you want it to act offensively, defensively, or balanced; this is similar (albeit in an extremely basic form) to the auto-battle and paradigm shifts of  Final Fantasy XIII. </div>  <div> Story :  Filgaia is a dying world. A weapon developed to defeat the invading Metal Demons a thousand years ago succeeded, but it came at the cost of the planet. Its life continually drains, and what once used to be lush green forests are now desolate wastelands infested by dangerous monsters. Mother - the leader of the Metal Demons - was defeated but not killed. Her heart was split into three pieces and hidden in statues around the world to combat her ability to constantly regenerate. However, the Metal Demon threat has resurged; a group led by Ziekfried, the 'Quarter Knights', stole Mother's inactive body and plot to reclaim the pieces of her heart in a bid to revive her and take over Filgaia. The Guardians - an ancient race who protected Filgaia in the past - grow weak. With what little power they can still muster, the descendant of an ancient bloodline -  Princess Cecilia - is called upon to help protect the planet. Her destiny is intertwined with a trouble treasure hunter -  Jack Van Burace - and a young dreamchaser called  Rudy Roughnight.The trio are employed to excavate an ancient golem on the outskirts of Adlehyde, but the city is attacked during this time by the demons. Princess Cecilia, distraught at losing her father in the attack, agrees to give the demons the Tear Drop crystal - a family heirloom that they believe could be crucial in reviving Mother - in exchange for sparing the city. Witnessing first-hand the danger the Quarter Knights pose to Filgaia, the trio vow to stop Mother's revival.With the help of technology left behind by the Elw - the ancient race who repelled the demons in the past - to navigate Filgaia and the support of the Guardians, the group pursues the Quarter Knights across the land. Unfortunately, they are unable to prevent them from acquiring all three pieces of Mother's heart, and she is revived. To the knights' surprise, Mother's plan for Filgaia is to destroy it and everyone on it (including the demons), whereas their own plan had been to take over the planet and enslave its inhabitants. Meanwhile, the heroes venture into the tomb of Asgard, an earth golem that will allow them to penetrate the heavily guarded Photosphere - the Metal Demons' base of operations. They manage to infiltrate the base, and with the help of a mysterious stranger, reclaim Cecilia's Tear Drop crystal and defeat a weakened Mother. As the Photosphere begins to sink into the ocean, the stranger is revealed to be Ziekfried, playing the group to eliminate Mother and continue with his plans.The Demons plan to destroy the network created by the Guardians - the Ray Line - used as a last resort to consolidate their power and maintain Filgaia. The group battles forth and confront Ziekfried, who is thrown into a rift in space during the encounter. He wakes up in the sunken ruins of the Photosphere and is consumed by Mother, but the remaining Quarter Knights aren't deterred. They create their own crystal that destroys rather than creates, and plan to use the Ray Line to distribute it and disrupt the entire planet. However, this becomes secondary to the discovery of Malduke, a space station containing a weapon that could destroy Filgaia. The heroes fight their way to Malduke by climbing Ka Dingel, the tower that connects Filgaia to Malduke, and confront Motherfried, a fusion of Mother and Ziekfried.They succeed in defeating Motherfried, but the weapon has already been activated. The Guardians muster all the power they have left to protect the planet, while the group teleports back to Filgaia. In the middle of the teleportation, the remnant of ZIekfried makes a final, desperate attempt to foil the party. He fails, and the trio arrives back at a collapsing Ka Dingel. Asgard, the golem they had used to penetrate the Photosphere, saves the day by guarding them from the debris and explosions, and is destroyed in the process. This theme - of the ability to feel and love overcoming the purpose of being created solely as a weapon - is a constant in the story (see  Rudy and  Jack). Finally, Filgaia is safe again. Jack and Rudy leave Cecilia to rule over Adlehyde, but she gets away from the castle to continue traveling with them. </div>  <div> Music : WILD ARMS Complete TracksThe soundtrack is composed by  Michiko Naruke, and is probably the aspect most strongly influenced by the  wild west. The overworld theme, 'Lone Bird in the Shire', contains a melody used by Ennio Morricone (in 'The Ecstasy of Gold'), a composer known for his scores in Western-themed movies. A single-CD sample entitled 'Wild Arms Original Game Sountrack' was released in Japan in 1997; after the release of Wild Arms Alter Code: F, the full soundtrack of the original game ('Wild Arms Complete Tracks') was relased in 2006.

WC3 was the first in the franchise to use full motion video to tell the story instead of the animated cut-scenes used in the first two games. It is also the first in the series to change from the previous 2D sprite-based graphics to 3D texture-mapped polygonal graphics.The Full Motion Videos were directed by Chris Roberts and featured famous actors such as Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange), John Rhys-Davies (Lord of the Rings) and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) in the central role of Colonel Christopher Blair. In between missions, Blair could engage in branching conversations with his fellow wing-mates. These conversations usually affected how that character treats him and/or her as the story proceeds. The game is considered to be one of the first ""interactive movie""s and was advertised as such. The FMVs were achieved using green screens with all of the sets being created in post-production. Wing Commander III was the most expensive game to be produced at the time with a budget of $4 million dollars.Previously going by the fan name of ""Bluehair"" in the first two games, the main character of the series was finally given the name of Christopher Blair. Due to the player being able to choose Blair's callsign, the character's actual callsign of ""Maverick"" would not be made canon until Wing Commander Prophecy. After every mission briefing, the player has the choice of his wingman for that mission along with his fighter craft and its weapons loadout. As in the first Wing Commander, a majority of your various wingmen could be permanently killed during battle or in certain events during the storyline. </div>  <div> Plot : The Concordia is a total lossThe game begins with a scene on the Kilrathi planet of Kilrah showing Terran Confederation POWs being executed in front of a cheering audience.

They jump around before they explode; they do a maximum of 75 damage.Grenade: The power and length of fuse can be set to ensure maximum damage. Grenades tend to bounce around a lot and are useful for hitting worms hidden in holes.Cluster Bomb: Like the grenade but instead the bomb explodes into smaller cluster bombs which also explode. Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run. Does a maximum of 75 damage.Mine: Places a mine on the ground which will be set off by any worm coming close to it.

Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes.

Worms World Party,The Code Monkeys,Titus Software,"December 14, 2001",ps,More worm-based mayhem from Team17.,3030-18822,18822,0,2001-03-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/worms-world-party/3030-18822/,ESRB: E," <div> General : Worms World Party, the seventh game in the Worms series, was released in 2001.As with previous Worms games, its a side scrolling turn based strategy game where the player controls their team of well armed and athletic worms against up to 5 AI or player teams.The game has various modes, from a fairly simple deathmatch mode, to a mode where after each win, either a worm is taken off the team or a worm is added to an AI team, thus making it much more difficult and rewarding with each successive win. There is also a training mode to help perfect the art of a wind guided rocket shot, there's also a story mode and various fun multiplayer modes including online and offline local play with up to 6 players off and online.There is over 1000 game styles, and an infinite number of custom maps and game types may be added. </div>  <div> Gameplay : For slimy invertebrates, the worms are very agile and skilled in the art of jumping, even doing a backflip jump to get onto even higher ledges, and among other things they are able to parachute and use ninja ropes to reach otherwise unreachable places.Weapons greatly range from a bog standard shotgun or handgun, to the much more fun to use banana bomb, sheep bomb, holy hand grenade and... The DONKEY, the Donkey is well.. a huge stone donkey that can be command to fall anywhere, bouncing up and down upon impact and blowing the general area to shit until it reaches water, usually taking a few unfortunate worms with it.Sudden Death occurs either after an Indian Nuke Test is used, when the game gets too long or after a player initiates it (local multiplayer only). </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Online worm fun is where it kicks off, from:creating custom team for online & offline modes,Name each team member and use any sort of soundsCan have a custom national anthem play upon winningUpon being shot worms will cry out in any accent of choosingGravestones are changeable and can even create custom gravestonesMapsSoundbites and pretty much everything from scratchSometimes players come across a team with a cock as their gravestone and harry potter sounds, which is always fun, and also create custom maps, be it a simple maze with explosive barrels everywhere, or for the more skilled and being savvy, create an awesome map like Pamela Anderson stretched out naked for the team of slimy critters to wriggle all over before blowing her bazooka's off with.. a bazooka. In general pretty much everything can be edited and personalized.Most online games involve frequent use of the ninja rope, the community has perfected their ninja skills, roping from one side of the landscape back and forth collecting items and zooming through impossible looking gaps to land gracefully on a ledge before dropping a dynamite and swinging off again. </div>  <div> Shopper, WxW, Rope-race and Fly : Pretty much every online match will consist of one or more of these game rules. All were made up by players, these rules don't have to be followed, but the other players can punish other players, as explained below.Shopper is a game type where:CBA (collect a crate before attacking)AFR (Attack From rope)KTL (Kill the leading player)ABL (Attack anyone except the one in last place)If a player breaks one or more of these rules then that player is the Cow. The other players should say ""Cow"" on the in-game chat to notify a break in the rules. The ""Cow"" will have to skip their next turn in accordance to the rules. If he or she doesn't skip, the other players may KTC (Kill the Cow) in which all players attack the Cow to remove him or her from the game and generally embarrass them.WxW is pretty much the same rules as a shopper game, except a lot more skill is required and must touch a certain number of walls before attacking, usually using a ninja rope, leaving very few precious seconds to attack before running out of time, if there's no damage to the player whilst swinging..Rope-Race is usually played in a maze style map containing a start point and a finish. It begins by placing worms at the start, no rope knocking (jumping from a rope to hit an enemy worm, usually into water) and first to the finish wins. Another version of this is Time-Trial Rope-Race, in this game type, there is no timer to complete the level. Once all worms have had a single turn, whoever made it to the finish in the least amount of time wins and is hailed champ!!Fly, Like WxW, Fly is based on the same rules as a Shopper game, but an extra rule FBA (Fly before attacking) is added. The player must ""Fly"" over the center point of the map using a parachute or ninja rope, or any other way the player manages to do so, it will most likely be a high or wide object. Techniques of flying include letting go of the ninja rope just after bouncing off a wall to send the worm flying, or swinging around a loose pixel created from an explosion. </div>  <div> Weapons : WWP has 60 Weapons and utilities in all including:Bazooka - Standard weapon with infinite ammo in most game modes, wind speed and direction strongly effects it.Grenade - Can be tossed in any direction. Player is able to set the timer from 1-5 seconds, no wind effects.Cluster bomb - A red grenade that scatters a cluster of explosions upon detonation.Mine - Proximity mine that can be dropped anywhere.

Ending turn upon arrival.Holy Hand Grenade - Huge explosion causing a lot of damage to any worm unfortunate to be in range.Pneumatic Drill - Only useful for drilling holes to hide in, or drilling through an enemies squishy head.Mortar - Can't control the power of this as it just fires straight, pretty hard to use with no prior knowledge of how this works.Super Sheep - Like sheep except another press of the action key/button makes it fly and controllable in mid-air.Cattle Prod - Extremely low damage, just a little poke, mostly used for humor to poke enemies over a ledge into water.Napalm - Like air strike but with fire, strongly affected by wind.Homing Pigeon - Similar to the homing missile, the pigeon is better as it can move to avoid colliding with scenery and can reach tighter places.Letter Bomb - Like Napalm and Air Strike but it drops several letters/envelopes causing large explosions, strongly affected by wind also.Longbow - Mid Damage ranged weapon, inaccurate at range.Handgun - Causes small damage to worms and terrain, not worth using unless as a last resort or to finish off an enemy.Mini-gun - Powerful enough to create a worm sized hole in the terrain and if every bullet hits.. maybe to kill.Battle Axe - Close range, low power melee weapon.Mole - Mole Jumps and burrows into land, it also explodes.Mad Cow - Release a troop of timed cows, each causing a massive explosion.Old Lady - Slow but deadly old woman, detonate for huge explosion.Baseball Bat - Smack a worm and watch it fly, great to use at the start to get rid of one full health worm via water.Bungee - Jump from a ledge using this, and will hang there like a worm on a fishing hook, doesn't use move and can drop explosives.Fast Walk - Exactly what it says, lets the worms travel faster for one turn.Skip Go - If hiding safely in a hole, use this to skip the move.Low Gravity - Lets the worm jump higher and further.Jet pack - A jet pack with a limit of 30 flight time, continuous flight would be about 7 seconds.Worm Select - Gives the ability to switch between worms and then attack.Skunk - Like all animals its explosive, but as this releases toxic gas from its arse that makes all infected worms lose 5 health each turn, the explosion is smaller.Donkey - A huge concrete donkey that falls where it is command to, blows up terrain with each impact and bounces straight up and down until it reaches water, on smaller fort maps this could take out the whole enemy team.Indian Nuclear Test - Sudden Death, Rising water and poison water, get too close to the water and get sick, combined with sudden death its lethalSuicide Bomber - Best used for the player's favorite enemy and it is self detonated, if that isn't enough it also infects the enemy with sickness(same as skunk).Sheep Launcher - Launches sheep resulting in massive terrain and worm damage, Best shot high to avoid bouncing past the enemy.Aqua Sheep - Exactly like Super sheep but can also go underwater.Molotov/Petrol Bomb - Explodes on impact causing a small or large area of log lasting flame, depending on the surface its thrown on, it can spread quite a bit.Flame thrower - Affected by wind, shoots flames, great for damaging and moving worms over a ledge or closer to a barrel to then explode, Short range.Laser Target - Gives team a dotted aim line, great for sniping with a shotgun.Invisibility - Online only, makes the worm invisible to the enemies.Earthquake - Only use this if the worms are in a safe place, not near mines, water or high falls, shakes terrain usually resulting in worms going for a swim.Mine Strike - Drops 5 Mines onto the player's target, mines bounce and scatter on landing.Mole Squadron - 5 moles dropped where the player chooses, excellent if the player wants some holes dug, moles explode on impact after digging (either dig into water or drop into an underground cave and explode).Scales of Justice - Adds 2 teams health together and splits it evenly, good for stealing health from enemy worms.Super Banana Bomb - Like cluster Bomb, only with the super powerful Banana, after initial explosion 5 more bananas emerge.French Sheep Strike - 5 Sheep fall where the players want, really funny to watch.Priceless Ming Vase - Ming Vase AKA Super Dynamite, pretty much the same but more powerful.Carpet Bomb - 5 exploding and powerful Carpets/Rugs where the player command, more efficient than French Sheep.Magic Bullet - Even more advanced than the homing pigeon, this beast will find its target, unless they're hiding in an underground cavern. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Pentium 100MHz (Minimum)Pentium 200MHz (Recommended)Windows 95/98/Me/XP2X CD-ROM Drive (Minimum)8X CD-ROM Drive (Recommended)32Mb RAM (Minimum)4MB DirectX compatible Graphics Card (Minimum)DirectX compatible Sound CardInternet Connection (optional) </div> "

The engine for the game was originally developed for the game Thrill Kill, which when that game was abruptly cancelled, the developers, wishing to not have all their work go to waste, ported it to the making of various other games, such as this game and X-Men: Mutant Academy. The game was controversial for containing ""offensive"" content. It was released on October 31, 1999. </div>  <div> Story : When the last master of the ancient kung-fu style of Wu-Tang, Master Xin, is kidnapped by the evil Mong Zhu, who plans on discovering the powerful secrets of Wu-Tang, Master Xin's students, who also happen to be the members of the Wu-Tang Clan, vow to track down Zhu and rescue their master. Their journey takes the Clan from Staten Island to China, and on the way, they must battle with the many minions of Mong Zhu until they can finally face off against Zhu himself. But when they arrive in China, they find out that Zhu has already found out the secret of Wu-Tang and killed Master Xin, Mong Zhu then realizes that the Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthing ta Fuck Wit. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The combat in Shaolin Syle is similar to many fighting games in that it uses 2 punch buttons and 2 kick buttons along with buttons assigned to crouching and blocking. However, where it differentiates itself from other fighters is that it can have up to four people fighting simultaneously, and instead of rounds, each character has a pre-determined amount of lives in each battle. When a character loses a life, he respawns immediately, until no life is left; then he is out of the game.The game also features fatalities, but unlike most other games with fatalities, they don't involve inputting a special button sequence. Instead the fatality depends purely on what button was used to deal the finishing blow. Up to 5 fatalities can be unlocked for each character, 4 representing each of the face buttons and 1 for the throw move.The game features each member of the Wu-Tang Clan as a playable character each with a different fighting style. For example, ODB uses drunken boxing, Masta Killa is a ninja with a big knife, Raekwon is a master of shadow boxing and therefore fights only using punches, The RZA fights with two swords, like a certain member of the TMNT and The GZA fights with a so-called ""Liquid Sword"", which is basically a chain with a knife on the end. Mong Zhu and his minions are also unlockable characters. </div>  <div> Wu Tang ""W"" Shaped Controller : A special edition of Wu Tang: Shaolin Style was released that included a special controller in the shape of the Wu Tang signature ""W"". This controller is a very rare collectors item now. </div>  <div> Trivia : Featured as the game that Jeff and Ryan must save from the evil Nuke.com in the first episode of the Time Trotters Animated Series. Because...we all know that it is a masterful, classic game.The game featured a ""High Violence Mode"" which required you to input a code cleverly hidden in the games manual (At the back of the booklet). </div> "

Departing from earlier 16-bit era WWF licensed games developed by Sculptured Software, such as WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw, WWF in Your House uses digitized sprites and focuses on fast paced, strike and combo based fighting, common to the fighting games at the time.Unlike earlier titles which grounded the gameplay in ""realistic"" deliberately paced grappling and momentum based combat, the action in WWF in Your House is quick and over the top, with weapons appearing out of nowhere, characters morphing shape, and characters using lightening and fire attacks. Like other games in the fighting genre, WWF in Your House also features character-specific attacks and stages. For example, the British Bulldog's list of moves includes the Union Jack Attack and his stage appears to be in front of Buckingham Palace. In game commentary is provided by Vince McMahon and Mr. Perfect.Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City would abandon the digitized sprite style for polygonal 3D models and over the top action for grapple based combat in its 1998 follow up title WWF War Zone. </div> "

This game boasted a much faster arcade-style play and was the predecessor of Acclaim's Attitude game. This game provided a much simpler system of performing moves rather than Acclaim's button-mashing technique. Grapples could be done by simply selecting a direction on the arrow pad and pressing a button. This also has been a staple of the franchise throughout its games, evolving each time. The gameplay modes were few, but included backstage areas for wrestlers to take their aggressions out on each other. </div>  <div> Gameplay : WWF SmackDown! is like your basic wrestling game with fast arcade-style gameplay. You take control of one wrestler and are set in the ring against another wrestler (number of wrestlers varies on match type). Grapples and strikes in this game are executed by using the directional pad in different directions and pushing the circle or X button. Also, both buttons can be combined to pull off special moves such as power bombs. WWF SmackDown! also allowed you to fight backstage and use many objects lying around the area in which you are fighting. This was the second wrestling game to have this feature (the first game being WCW Mayhem). The game also had an extensive season mode which had never been included in a WWF game. </div>  <div> Roster : Al SnowBig Boss ManThe Big ShowBilly GunnBradshawBubba Ray DudleyChris JerichoChristianChynaDebraD'Lo BrownDevon DudleyEdgeFaarooqGangrelThe GodfatherHardcore HollyJeff HardyKaneKen ShamrockMankindMark HenryMatt HardyPaul BearerRoad DoggThe RockShane McMahonSteve AustinSteve BlackmanTestToriTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisVince McMahonX-Pac </div> "

It was also later released for the PlayStation. X-COM: UFO Defense, along with four other X-COM games, were released digitally via Steam on September 4, 2008. Throughout the game, players will encounter a multitude of alien races that are intent on subjugating the people of Earth. The Extraterrestrial Combat Unit must prevent this from happening by tracking and shooting down UFOs, stopping terror attacks on major cities, and eliminating alien bases before they can infiltrate governments across the world.Bases, workers and squad destinations are managed in the Geoscape view, before switching to the battlescape view for missions.Troops sent on missions improve with the actions they take and can individually be equipped with a variety of firearms and grenades. Upon elimination of all the aliens on the battlescape, alien artifacts will be returned to the base, where players can assign scientists to start researching different weapons and technology. New weapons, gadgets, and aircrafts can be manufactured by engineers, adding items like medpacks, hover tanks, and plasma weapons to the arsenal. </div>  <div> Development : UFO: Enemy Unknown was originally conceived as a sequel to Laser Squad, another game by Julian Gollop. </div>  <div> Scenarios : Troops leave their Skyranger to investigate a small UFO.Shooting down UFOs will allow a transport ship to land at the crash site, where troops will be tasked with eliminating any surviving aliens. All missions play out in turns, with the player always going first. Troops have Action Points that are depleted by everything from moving and shooting to turning and priming grenades.Alien weaponry is far superior to the the troops' ballistic rifles and heavy cannons, requiring caution to keep squad members alive. Reaction fire allows soldiers to save action points for the alien turn, and, depending on an individual's reaction stat, he or she may fire on an alien that moves into line of sight. UFOs may also land; players can take advantage of this by sending transport ships to catch the aliens off guard. Research rewards are often better, as the UFO itself is not damaged, unlike when alien crafts are shot down. However, this also means that there will be more aliens to contend with on the ground.Terror missions are arguably the most difficult, as they occur at inopportune times around the world and last only a few in game days, leaving little time to prepare before the city is ransacked. Failing or ignoring these missions will make the local government unhappy, which might lead to funding cuts at the end of the month. In terror missions, the aliens set out to kill as many civilians as possible, so players must attempt to protect citizens by quelling the alien threat as quickly as possible.Aliens also will try to construct bases on Earth, as evidenced by heavy UFO activity in certain countries (a month by month stat page can help highlight this information). These missions are completed by killing or capturing all aliens inside. It is worth noting that at the core of the bases, a high-ranking alien can usually be found who will yield valuable information if taken alive and interrogated.The world map progresses with time, and missions can be taken during night or day. All the aliens have the unique advantage of seeing as well at night as day. Therefore players can opt to wait until daylight to attempt a given mission, in order to not be at a disadvantage. </div>  <div> Aliens : A sectoid.There are five alien races, each with an associated support unit, usually only seen on the terror missions or within their bases.  </div>  <div> Base Building : The Sectoids are based on the greys. They pair with Cyberdiscs - mini UFOs that hover and shoot, but explode when destroyed. </div>  <div> Research & Development : The aptly named Snakemen are physically tough units that team up with the terrifying Chryssalids, fast moving bipedal insects that turn their victims into zombies, which can then turn into more Chryssalids. </div>  <div> UFO Interception : Floaters have no legs, and instead float around and guide their giant accomplices, the Reapers. </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Purple and green Mutons, who couple with Celatids - purple floating creatures that shoot acid.

X-Men vs. Street Fighter,Capcom,Capcom,"June 11, 1998",ps,The mutants of Marvel's X-Men and the martial artists of Capcom's Street Fighter collide in Capcom's first crossover fighting game.,3030-11156,11156,0,1996-10-04,https://www.giantbomb.com/x-men-vs-street-fighter/3030-11156/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D tag-team fighting game developed and released by Capcom for the arcades (under the CPS-2 engine) on October 4, 1996. The first installment of the long-running Marvel vs. Capcom crossover series, the game pits fighters from X-Men: Children of the Atom with the fighters from Street Fighter Alpha 2, in a fast-paced high-flying tag team match. Using the ""Variable"" system, players can tag in their backup character (either on-the-fly or as a counter-attack) or perform a special ""combination"" attack (in which both characters perform their Hyper Combos simultaneously).The game was ported to the Saturn (in Japanese regions only) on November 27, 1997 and PlayStation on June 30, 1998. While the Saturn version retains all animations and the tag-team mechanic of the arcade version (thanks to the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge), the PlayStation version removes the tag-team mechanics for normal gameplay (restricting it to traditional 1v1 round-based fights, in which the secondary character plays an ""assist"" role), adding a new ""Crossover Mode"" (in which the tag-team mechanic is brought back, but each player's secondary character is the opposing player's primary character). </div>  <div> Gameplay : X-Men vs. Street Fighter uses very similar gameplay style that was developed in Marvel Super Heroes, and also adds the tag team feature. The game doesnt use the regular three round format, but each player has two characters, controlling one at a time, while the other character waits off screen. The player can tag the waiting character in at any time by pushing the hard punch and hard kick buttons at the same time, which then activates what is known as the ""Variable Attack"", with the character jumping in with an attack and briefly taunting. During the character taunt, they are open for a counter attack. The character now off screen with recover a small portion of their vitality, with the current character now fighting. When one character dies, the other character will automatically be tagged in, and when both characters have died, the match is then over.There are different ways to bring the other character in; such as the ""Variable Counter"", which replaces the Infinity Counter from Marvel Super Heroes, breaks the opponents guard to then bring the teammate in with a counter attack while using some of the super meter. There is also the ""Variable Combination"", which is a two-character Hyper Combo (the super moves in the game) which drains two levels of the super meter, and will then switch the player's current character as long as neither character gets hit during their Hyper Combos.Most of the X-Men characters are from X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes, with three new additions being Rogue, Sabertooth and Gambit. The Street Fighter characters use their forms from Street Fighter Alpha 2 with their special moves getting upgrades to match the over-the-top Marvel games (example being, Ken's Shoryuken makes him flame up and hit his opponent very high). This game gives the first appearance of the ""Shadaloo"" version of Cammy, who would then be used later in Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold and Street Fighter Alpha 3. </div>  <div> Characters : X-Men vs. Street Fighter includes 17 playable characters (eight from X-Men side and nine from the Street Fighter side). The game also includes an unplayable boss, Apocalypse, who takes up much of the screen and does not have a tag partner. After defeating him in single-player, the player is forced to fight his/her teammate to show the player-controlled character's ending. </div> "

Xenogears,"Square Co., Ltd.","Square Co., Ltd.JP, Square Electronic ArtsUS","October 20, 1998",ps,"Xenogears is an RPG spanning several millennia, weaving religion and philosophy with science fiction and turn based gameplay.",3030-18304,18304,0,1998-02-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/xenogears/3030-18304/,CERO: D," <div> Overview : Xenogears is a console role-playing game released by Squaresoft in 1998 for the PlayStation. The game features a millennia spanning science fiction storyline and multiple battle systems, and is the basis for the tangentially related Xenosaga series. Upon its release, it was met with positive acclaim from critics, garnering an 84% average rating on reviews aggregate Metacritic and a 91% on Game Rankings.The game was developed by a team including director Tetsuya Takahashi (who later joined a team at Monolith Soft, developer of both Xenosaga and Xenoblade Chronicles) and famed composer Yasunori Mitsuda (known for his work on the Chrono series). The game is considered to primarily represent 'Episode V' of the story of the game's world. Due to not reaching one million sales within a year, the game was not green-lit for any sequels.Xenogears is known for its storyline, which is heavily influenced by philosophy (such as the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung), religion and Biblical allusions, and science fiction concepts (most notably nanomachines and the relationship between man and machine). </div>  <div> Plot : The game begins with Fei, gregarious martial artist and painter, preparing for a big wedding. But a civil war finds its way to his home, and while attempting to fight off the invaders, his enigmatic past catches up with him. The people of his own village banish him, and he sets out on a complex and gripping quest.While at first the game seems to be following traditional rpg territory, i.e. strange man in a rural village with memory loss sets off on an adventure, the game explores much darker themes and gets very complex toward the end. The game pretty much touches on everything: love, hate, loyalty, racism, religion, the nature of humanity, etc. The game is set in the world of Ignas where 2 great nations are at war: Aveh and Kislev. The game begins with Fei living in the and the whole village looking forward to the wedding of the year. But their normal lives are destroyed when their village gets caught in the crossfire of a gear battle between Aveh and Kislev. During the battle Fei becomes trapped and his only means of survival is to enter the cockpit of a crashed gear, but when he does, something stirs within him and he automatically knows how to control the gear. Using the gear he clears the invaders from the village, but the villagers turn their anger on Fei as he fought back and they blame him and chase him out of the village. The only thing Fei can do now is to try and find out how he knows how to pilot a gear and why this particular gear feels so familiar. </div>  <div> Characters : Xenogear's story spans across 15 000 years, beginning in 2001 with the discovery of the ""Zohar"", an artificial 3.9 billion years old eye-shaped object. First believed to be the source of all life on earth, it was eventually forgotten and lost for nearly 5000 years before being rediscovered. It was soon found to be able to produce an infinite amount of energy by manipulating the fabric of reality. At the time a cosmic conflict was turning into a full scale war, and the Zohar was used as the power source for Deus. A bio-mechanical planetary invasion weapon capable of single handedly suppressing and destroying an enemy planet and repairing itself using biological material found on the battleground. However, during the connection between Deus and Zohar, a bodiless ""wave-being"" from a higher plane of existence was pulled into the three dimensional plane and was trapped inside Deus. Once completed, Deus was used once, but was found to be too effective. It utterly destroyed all life on the planet it was deployed to and it's efficiency scared its creators so much it was decided Deus was to be destroyed by being thrown into a black hole. It was split into separate parts and transported on a city-sized spaceship called the Eldridge. However during the trip, Deus managed to hack into the Eldridge's computer system and changed the destination to the ‚Äúmain planet‚Äù. In the ensuing chaos the Eldridge crash landed on an unknown planet leaving Deus scattered and only one survivor: A seven year old boy, Abel, who stumbled across the Zohar while looking for his mother. Able came in contact with the Wave Existence and through it's protection landed safely. He gained several powers from the Wave Existence, including the power of reincarnation. The Wave Existence also created a woman for him in the image of his mother called Elhaym (Elly). Deus, unable to function in it's current state, activated it's self repair system, and seeded the planet with human beings to be used as spare parts. Only the best specimens could be used, and so the planet was ‚Äúreset‚Äù several times through induced war, pushing human evolution forward.10 000 years later the self restoration system is nearing conclusion, and the game begins with the current reincarnations of Abel and Elhaym: Fei and Elly. </div>  <div> Combat :   CharacterInformationFei Fong WongFei is the game‚Äôs main character. He has no memory of his childhood, and only remembers being brought to Lahan where he was left by a mysterious man. He resides peacefully with his friends until a group of Gears lands within the town and starts fighting. Feeling he has no other choice, Fei climbs about an unmanned Gear and begins to fend off the invaders. An explosion from the Gear killed two of his close friends and decimated the village, leading to his immediate exile from the village. In combat, Fei uses an extensive knowledge of martial arts, and initially pilots the Gear Weltall.Elhaym Van HoutenElly is a Gebler soldier currently aligned with the nation of Aveh. Her team is responsible for the tragedy that occurred in Lahan, and meets Fei shortly after he is exiled. Despite her contempt for land dwellers, she is kind to Fei. In combat, Elly fights with a rod and her powerful elemental ether skills, and initially pilots the Gear Vierge.Citan UzukiCitan is a doctor and scientist who lives in the mountains near Lahan with his wife, Yui, and daughter Midori. He aids Fei after he is exiled from Lahan, bringing with him the Gear that Fei piloted. He joins Fei‚Äôs quest away from his hometown, and offers him advice when the situation arises. In combat, he is adept at martial arts, and initially pilots the Gear Heimdal.Bartholomew FatimaBart is the young pirate captain of the Yggdrasil, a sand cruiser that scavenges the . He is the rightful ruler of Aveh, but was pushed out by Shakhan. He wears an eye-patch over his eye due to an engine explosion that occurred on his sand cruiser.

She was created by a past incarnation of Fei. In combat, she is able to manipulate her body into different attacking forms, and she pilots the Gear Crescens.  </div>  <div> Music : The game features random encounters where the player is thrown into battle randomly when walking around the world map and within certain areas. The combat is an interesting blend of real-time and turn-based action. Each character has an action bar that fills up depending on that character's speed. Once that character's action bar is full the battle pauses and it becomes their turn. This is not quite real time because the player is given unlimited time to plan out their move when a character is active.Each character has three attack buttons signifying weak, medium, and fierce. Each attack takes a certain number of AP, and each character has 7 AP to use for attacks. By putting in special combinations (such as weak, weak, fierce) that character may execute a special technique called a deathblow. Each character has their own set of deathblow combinations that can be learned by inputting their commands. This makes the game a little tough without a list of known abilities because a player cannot use an ability unless they've input the command for that ability several times already. Also, certain deathblows can only be learned when a character reaches a particular level.The game features a mechanic where a character can attack one or more times then press the cancel button to stop attacking in the middle of a combo. This allows that player to save any ability points not spent to use on their next turn. For example, if it is Fei's turn and he executes a weak attack then cancels the combo, he will have 6 AP left over. At the start of Fei's next turn he will have 13 AP rather than 7. A character can store a maximum of 28 AP. By having additional AP, characters can enter a mode called ""combo"" where they chain together the deathblows that they have learned to do stronger damage than individual deathblows would have allowed. Each deathblow performed during the combo will subtract its cost from the pool of AP available. </div>  <div> Game Trivia : In addition to the hand to hand combat, the game also features battles utilizing big giant fighting robots called Gears. During some of the random encounters, you can elect to jump into your gear at any point and stomp on your enemies, but mostly Gears are used in specific gear-centric environments where you fight mechanical monsters. The battle mechanics are slightly different but like the hand to hand combat it is based around combos and building up to a deathblow type attack. Instead of AP you have Fuel and attack level; each attack is broken into light, medium and strong and each one uses units of fuel , with light being the lowest. Every time you attack the enemy the attack level of the gear increases to the point where you can unleash a deathblow-like, combo special attack. There are 4 levels of special attacks 1,2,3 and infinity. If you reach infinity level your gear enters hyper mode which lasts for 3 turns and you can use super-powered special attacks and recharge fuel at a much faster rate. Hyper mode cannot be accessed until late in the game, as to access it, you need to have learned all deathblows for your gear. Gear combat has a few other options, there is a charge option which makes the gear recharge some fuel, there is a boost option which increases the frequency of your gears turns but it consumes fuel more quickly. You can also recharge your gears HP using the special option and finally you still have access to ether attacks in your gear. </div> "

An iOS version of the game was launched on December 13th 2012, which syncs with the player's Facebook account, and all their stats and money can be tracked between the browser and mobile versions.Players play each other asynchronously, trying to answer a series of questions as quickly and accurately as they can. Right answers credit the player with an amount of cash (or ""bling"") relative to how quickly they buzzed in and wrong answers penalize by the same amount. Whoever has the most bling by the end is the winner. </div>  <div> Microtransactions : The game is free to play, and is supported via microtransactions. Players always get one free round per day, but can spend money to buy additional rounds and score multipliers. At first, the game started out using the universal ""Facebook Credits"" currency for micro-transactions. But in September 2012 they switched to a game-specific ""token"" based system, which players can buy directly within the game. One round of YDKJ costs 200 tokens, and 1,000 tokens can be purchased for $2.00. Players can also earn tokens for free by watching advertisements & claiming offers from sponsors. Players still get one free game per day, but can no longer stock-pile rounds by logging into the game and not playing. </div>  <div> Differences From The 2011 Console/PC Version : The chief differences between the Facebook version and the console version are that each individual quiz has only five rounds, including the final round of Jack Attack. The player also does not have the opportunity to be named by the game; they instead use their first name as defined on their Facebook profile. The ""production crew"" background chatter is eliminated and there is no longer a ""wrong answer of the game"" feature. It does, however, share the previous versions' predilection for fake sponsors and other commercials/programs playing in the background.It also has ""Dis or Dat"", ""Funky Trash"", ""The Put The Choices Into Order Then Buzz In And See If You Are Right Question"" and ""Cookie's Fortune Cookie Fortunes With Cookie ""Fortune Cookie"" Masterson"" special questions from the 2011 edition, the ""Gibberish Question"" from prior versions of the game, as well as the Facebook unique ""Elephant, Mustard, Teddy Roosevelt or Dracula?"" (in which the answer is (nearly) always one of the four things mentioned), which will occasionally replace any of the first four questions.Because of the truncated format there's a quick turnaround on new quizzes, which means this version has the opportunity for it to be extremely topical with its pop culture trivia. </div> "
