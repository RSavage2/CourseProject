You do much of the same in the game, but the enemies strike little resemblance to those in the comic. The Spider Aliens of the comic book are slightly humanoid, while those found in the game resemble over-sized bugs. You must save Earth from invading enemies, much like in the movie Starship Troopers released a couple of years earlier. </div>  <div> Gameplay : ScreenshotIt's a first-person shooter where each mission is objective-based. There are five environments, both on Earth and in space. Several game segments are on-rails. Player are ranked in a points system and promoted when due. There are two Armorines available for play, one slow and strong and one fast and adequate in strength. Two-player co-op and standard four-player Deathmatch are supported.The game uses Acclaim's Turok 2 engine. By using a Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, the Nintendo 64 version can output in hi-res (640 x 480). The game had no analog support on the PlayStation version, making the control schemes difficult to use.On the GameBoy Color version, you play as a single marine with five weapons to choose from. There are six levels and seven kinds of enemies. </div>  <div> Characters : Gunnery Sergent Harold ""Gunny"" LewisLieutenant Myra Lane </div>  <div> Reception : Although sharing the same engine as the successful Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game did not fare well among videogame critics. IGN wrote that ""Armorines is a Starship Troopers add-on to the Turok 2 engine. Nothing more."" The GameBoy Color version generally received higher scores than the console versions. The Nintendo 64 version generally received higher scores than the PlayStation version; GameSpot wrote that discussing all the bad things about the PlayStation version ""would be like flogging a dead horse"" and that ""elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here.""A sequel for the game was planned, but then cancelled after the game's poor reception. </div>  <div> Prequel Comic : A four issue mini-series was released by Acclaim Comics prior to the games release.

In the game, players play as a bear named Banjo who wears a backpack containing his bird-friend - Kazooie. The game features large worlds full of collectibles, secrets, and enemies.Throughout his journey, Banjo and Kazooie must collect notes, new powers, and jiggys to advance to the next level. Also, the game features a very distinct soundtrack that features heavy use of a banjo. </div>  <div> Story : Banjo-Kazooie begins with a wicked witch named Gruntilda stirring a green liquid in her cauldron called Dingpot. She claims to be the most beautiful woman, until Dingpot explains how she is not, and that Tooty (Banjo's sister) is the prettiest girl ever. Gruntilda, who is always speaking in rhymes, explains how she will capture Tooty.She is successful and threatens to switch appearances with Tooty, when Banjo hears of what happened. From then on it is Banjo's duty to stop Gruntilda, with his bird-friend Kazooie, by going to different worlds, collecting tons of items, and eventually confronting Gruntilda herself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Snow Areas.Banjo-Kazooie follows a structure similar to that of Super Mario 64. Players are tasked with finding various collectible objects such Jiggys (Jigsaw Pieces), Musical Notes, and Mumbo Tokens and then using those objects to traverse through the hub-world. Jigsaw pieces open doors to new worlds by collecting enough to complete the corresponding jigsaw puzzle.There are ten Jiggies in each world: nine must be found, and one is granted by finding all five Jinjos on each world. Musical Notes open magic note doors that allow Banjo and Kazooie to progress further into Gruntilda's lair. There are 100 notes in each world, and 900 total in the game. Mumbo Tokens grant the player magical transformations at Mumbo's hut when the player collects a sufficient amount. These transformations include the following: termite, crocodile, walrus, pumpkin and bee.On the way, players will meet many characters, but the one who will help players the most is Mumbo - A skull-man who is able to cast magic. He helps Banjo on his quest by opening secret doors and stopping trains. Banjo travels along with his bird companion, Kazooie; she allows him to fly, climb, and she can turn into an egg-firing machine gun.Together they are bound to take down the evil Gruntilda - An evil witch who wants to control the world and commit evil deeds. She resides in her lair, with her trusty troll like companion.If a player receives a game over, a cut scene is show of Gruntilda successfully switching appearances with Tooty and becoming a beautiful witch, then mocking Banjo as the screen fades out. </div>  <div> Characters :  </div>  <div> Levels : BanjoOne of the two protagonists of the game, Banjo is a quirky Honey Bear trying to rescue his younger sister, Tooty. He lives in a small blue house in Spiral Mountain with his sister Tooty and friend Kazooie, and is easily recognized by his sharktooth necklace, blue backpack and bright yellow shorts. </div>  <div> Speech : KazooieA red-crested Breegull, Kazooie is the sassy counterpart to Banjo's light and cheerful demeanor. She stays in Banjo's blue backpack and helps Banjo to perform a large variety of moves with the help of Bottles' training, including running up steep, slippery slopes, flying and shooting eggs at the bad guys. </div>  <div> Stop 'N' Swop : GruntildaBanjo-Kazooie's antagonist, Gruntilda is an ugly witch obsessed with her looks. She captured Banjo's sister Tooty and plans to use a machine to steal young Tooty's good looks. Gruntilda, or Grunty for short, always speaks in rhyme during the course of the game. </div>  <div> Other Changes Prior To Release : TootyBanjo's younger sister who is captured by Gruntilda.

It is the sequel to 1998's Banjo-Kazooie. The game stars the famous bear and bird duo, Banjo and Kazooie, and is set two years after the events of Banjo-Kazooie. The game started development before the release of Banjo-Kazooie, and was released on November 19, 2000. </div>  <div> Story : King Jingaling and JinjosTwo years after the events of Banjo-Kazooie, Grunty was still stuck under the rock with Klungo still pushing it. One stormy night, while Banjo, Kazooie, Bottles, and Mumbo are playing cards in Banjo's House, a giant drill machine known as the Hag 1 drills out of a wall into Spiral Mountain. The rumbling of the machines caused Banjo and company to become worried. Unbeknownst to them, two witch sisters arrive and easily move the boulder that Gruntilda was trapped under in the last game. They send Mumbo out into the stormy night. He walks over to a nearby bush and sees Gruntilda She is no longer just an ugly witch, but a bony and uglier witch. After casting a bony eye on Spiral Mountain, she spies Mumbo and runs after him, magic blazing. He warns the others, who escape, but Bottles decides it's a trick, and gets caught in a blast. Banjo's house is destroyed, Bottles is dead, and the world is at risk. Grunty and her sisters then retreat to the Cauldron Keep in the Hag 1 drilling machine, scattering all of the jinjo families in the process.Banjo and Kazooie survey the wreckage, then decide it's time for another adventure. Along the way, they encounter many challenges, fearsome enemies, and a witch that is out for revenge. Nothing that a bear and a bird can't handle. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Banjo in Jolly Roger's LagoonBanjo-Tooie's gameplay is similar in concept to its predecessor, Banjo-Kazooie. The player must explore the hub world (Isle O' Hags) and enter nine large non-linear levels, each containing Jiggies which allow further access to the Isle. The core goal of the game is the same as the first, to collect as many jiggies as possible. There are a wide variety of puzzles, games, platforming and adventures that will net jiggies. Collecting them will afford access to new levels. All in all there are 90, with the player often needing to revisit levels with new moves in order to collect them. There are also other collectibles, such as musical notes and jinjos. The levels available run the gamut, from an ancient civilization to an underwear factory.Once again unlocking levels requires completing puzzles; however, this time the pictures are all based in one fixed point, Jiggywiggy's Temple. Also returning from the previous game is the ability to transform, allowing access to different areas, as well as the ability to learn new moves. Banjo and Kazooie start out with all the abilities they learned in the previous game. This is in contrast to the common ""lose moves"" scenario that some sequels take. They are able to jump, flip, swim, attack, and even fly (with the help of flying pads). They can also learn new moves from Bottles' brother Jamjars. However, this process has been altered from the previous installment. Whereas in Banjo-Kazooie, new moves had been free to learn whenever the player had located Bottles' Molehill, the new instructor Jamjars requires Musical Notes to learn new abilities. One of these new moves is the Split Up, which allows Banjo and Kazooie to, as the name suggests, go their separate ways and explore on their own. When doing so, the characters have different characteristics and new abilities. Kazooie is fast, can fly and hatch eggs but has one honeycomb health less than Banjo, whereas Banjo is slower, but has more health and can perform different abilities with his backpack. Another new staple is the addition of Mumbo Jumbo as a playable character. Mumbo can perform spells which can lead to a Jiggy or aid gameplay.The game is also groundbreaking in several areas, the biggest of these being level design and connection. Platformers before it typically had their levels linked only by a single hub world or overworld. In Banjo-Tooie however, most of the levels are interconnected in various ways. While there is still a hub world, players are able to cross between worlds themsevs, such as between Glitter Gulch Mine and Jolly Roger's Lagoon via water pipes, or between Terrydactyland and Witchyworld to grab some hamburgers. For certain jiggies cross travel is required. The biggest implementation of this is the train stations. There are train stations in most of the levels, which allow the player to hop on the train in one level, and choose which level to get off at (providing the player has found the station in that level first). </div>  <div> Multiplayer and Extras : There are a variety of things outside the single player adventure that are unlocked as it progresses. </div>  <div> Techniques : Multiplayer consists of all the various mini-games that are played throughout the game, such as the Mayahem Kickball Tournament. Games such as the Ordnance Shootout and Chomper's Belly put the player in First-Person, with Kazooie acting as a gun (and firing eggs) to either kill players or hit targets. Other games play as they would normally, with human players in for computers. </div>  <div> Items : The game records all of the mini-games, boss battles, and cutscenes that the player has gone through. They can then replay any of these standalone items at any time.Characters </div>  <div> Transformations : Banjo (""Yea-huh!"")Back for another adventure, Banjo is one of the main characters of the game. He is a brown bear with a penchant for helping people out. He wears his trademark yellow shorts, shark tooth necklace, and blue backpack. He was a bit oafish and slow to pick up on things in the first game, but nowadays he's shown flashes of a newfound wit... </div>  <div> Bosses : Kazooie (*facepalm*)The other central character of the series, Kazooie is a foul-mouthed breegull. Quick to judge, she is seen at the beginning robbing the poker players blind. She resides in Banjo's backpack, often coming out just to peck, drill, or demean. In this game though, she may have found a bit of compassion, as well as a way out of the backpack... </div>  <div> Stop 'n' Swop : Gruntilda the skeleton witch (*Evil laugh*)The series' main antagonist is at it again. After being freed from her rock, Grunty is now a very bony witch. She is heavyset, and has a hatred for the bear and bird. The quest will be to stop her destruction of the world. </div>  <div> Style and Cultural References : Mumbo the Shaman skull-guyReturning from the last adventure, Mumbo has been stripped of his transformation powers by an unknown force. Now though, he gets the chance to come out of the skull. He is a shaman, complete with a bony head, and skull staff (and house). Players can control him by bringing him a glowbo. He has a staff attack, as well as the ability to perform magic at Mumbo Pads, pads with his face on it. </div>  <div> Reception : WumbaMaking her debut in the series is Humba Wumba, a Native American shaman and rival to Mumbo Jumbo. She takes on his old role, transforming Banjo and Kazooie into various objects and animals. She needs to be given a Glowbo for her magic to work, but it is only needed once. Her transformations are valuable to solving the worlds many puzzles. </div>  <div> Xbox Live Arcade Version : Bottles the Mole (deceased)The teacher of moves from the first game, Bottles is back, albeit in another form. Killed in the beginning by Gruntilda's magic, he is only seen as a ghost in Spiral Mountain. He may have hope yet..... </div> "

Each track is respectively insane, with ghosts, dinosaurs, castles and alien spaceships. One level even uses WHAM!'s ""Last Christmas"" to set the tone.Each course features a variety of boxes strewn on or near the track. Boxes provide different rewards to the player; for instance, a nitro boost that increases speed. There are also special ""Flower Boxes"" that unlock cheats to modify gameplay. During singleplayer ""Championship"" races there are ""Points Boxes"" placed on the track worth varying amounts. 100 points are available on a given course, and because many boxes are placed on hidden shortcuts, a player who wishes to get the maximum number of points during a race must vary the path they take through the level each lap. Earning a full 100 points on a level unlocks new multiplayer arenas.The game is often compared to San Francisco Rush, because of its fun-oriented gameplay.Beetle Adventure Racing uses a modified version of the then-current Need for Speed engine, which manifests itself most visibly in terms of the four-point suspension and the zooming tachometer. The tracks differ slightly, however, and do not start and finish at the same point. Instead, each course has a brief entry road, the player races the allotted three laps, and the last lap switches guardrails in order to funnel the player into an exit track with a (usually dead-end) finish-line. Oddly enough, few games have employed a similar mechanic since then. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The game features a multiplayer portion for 2 to 4 players in split-screen. Two-player races can be unlocked by completing the single-player game. There is also a Beetle Battle mode, where players collect ladybugs, destroy each other and race to the finish. </div>  <div> Race Tracks : Coventry CoveMount MayhemInferno IsleSunset SandsMetro MadnessWicked Woods </div>  <div> Unlockables : Beetle Adventure Racing! contains multiple unlockable cars, each with different attributes. The final car to be unlocked is a New Beetle police car. While racing with the police car, other nearby cars can be slowed to a halt by using the car's police siren.Beyond new cars, there are many different cheats that can be unlocked by smashing the points boxes on the courses. These cheats do not necessarily make the game easier to play, and in many cases simply modify the game in interesting or amusing ways. For example, one of the early cheats earned is a ""Fisheye Lens"" camera that distorts the player's field of view. </div>  <div> Regional Variation: HSV Adventure Racing! (Australia) : In Australia, ""HSV Adventure Racing"" was released with Holden Special Vehicles instead of Volkswagen New Beetles, as well as region-specific voice work.

To quell the violence, a secret commission was formed and each territorial dispute is now settled by gladiatorial matches from genetically-enhanced humans.Along with its grimdark ""future sport"" setting, the game is known for its dedicated Fire button (which allows players to fire their character's weapons for long-range combat or activate a special regenerating shield), dedicated Hover button (which allows the fighters to hover in the air for a short period of time), and a variety of open arenas (sometimes with upper platforms and dangerous obstacles). It's also known for its ""mutilations"", special moves that instantly dismember, decapitate or bisect opponents. Like Time Killers and BloodStorm, fighters can keep fighting while armless (at an obvious disadvantage).The game was originally planned to be released in arcades (utilizing joysticks with a top-fire button), and some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) have been found (one of which is publically playable). </div>  <div> Characters : BullzeyeDeltaMinatekPsyclownPurgeSabotageSsapoZipperHeadClonus (boss)Mutilator (final boss) </div> "

The game's story involves a global crisis, as the group must escort a runaway missile carrier (carrying leaking nuclear missiles) to a ""ground zero"" for a controlled detonation.In each of the main levels, players must clear a path for the carrier by using special demolition vehicles to completely level buildings in the way. Along the way, they encounter puzzles requiring them to use special techniques (such as making wide swerves with the ""Backlash"" or pushing TNT crates with the ""Ramdozer"") or to switch between vehicles (as the player can dismount their vehicle at any time). They game also includes bonus objectives and side missions (including general destruction and racing).The game was later ported to the Xbox One as part of the 2015 Rare Replay compilation. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is broken up into several types of levels scattered across a map over the world. On each level the player must use demolition and go through puzzles to achieve the goal. The player usually begins in a demolition vehicle, but can exit the vehicle as the Pilot. </div>  <div> Vehicles : The Carrier Levels are the main portion of the game. The player is in control of a member of the Blast Corps crew, whose task is to control a wide variety of vehicles to destroy any building or debris that may obstruct the nuclear carrier's path. Players are limited on time, as the carrier can not be slowed down or stopped. In addition to destroying buildings with vehicles, players must sometimes solve puzzles, such as pushing around TNT crates to destroy more robust structures, use large blocks to fill holes, and move trains, to name a few.The player can leave vehicles and move around as The Pilot, who can enter other vehicles as needed. Different vehicles have their uses and weaknesses. Once the carrier’s path is clear, the player is free to enter the Blast Corps semi to end the level, or continue exploring. Successfully completing a carrier level unlocks the levels around it. Players can choose whether to continue with the next carrier level or complete a number of side missions.Certain buildings in the level contain survivors, which once freed will be picked up automatically by the Blast Corps chopper. Scattered across the levels are small objects that light up as the player passes over them called Radiation Dispersal Units (RDUs). There are also special (and more rare) collectables such as communication devices that unlock additional levels, and scientists that are required for later missions.Players receive medals on a level to show progress. Clearing the path for the carrier earns a gold medal, and then a second medal is given depending on the number of survivors, buildings destroyed, and RDUs collected by the player. After the initial clear, the player can enter the level without a time limit and search for all of the collectables for 100% completion.Points are received for every medal, and then as points accumulate, the player receives promotions. There are 31 ranks, and a promotion is given every 12 points. Bronze medals are worth 1 point, silvers are 2, gold are 3, and platinum medals are worth 4. </div> "

Brought into the world by the same publishers as such dubious games as Superman 64, the game was released roughly two years after the movie it was based on. The game itself is an action platformer where everything is out to kill you. </div>  <div> Story : The game follows the movie's plot *very*, *VERY* roughly insofar as Elwood Blues attempts to get the band back together for a battle of the bands. The game itself tells the vast breadth of its story in still images between levels, with the occasional exchange of dialogue.It's finally time for Elwood to be released from jail, but the 'evil warden' refuses to let him leave as a helpful prison guard informs him. After rescuing Buster from a demented lunch lady, Elwood confronted the evil warden and managed to escape Joilet State Prison. Before he escaped , he learned the warden has handed over the rest of the band- 'Mighty' Mac and Cab- to the mob.Elwood managed to make his way to Chicago to find Mac and Cab, only to end up running from a sewer alligator and confronting Willy. Elwood managed to rescue Mac, but Cab was still missing.After arriving in the Spooky Graveyard and dealing with evil trees, the band was finally reunited with the rescue of Cab. The band then went to Louisiana (The Swamp) to participate in a battle of the bands, and ultimately prevailed. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Blues Brothers picks up several cues from more influential platformers of the time. Elwood's slam mirrors Mario's butt stomp, and the main collectibles- notes- are back from Banjo-Kazooie. Other cues include collecting a hundred of an item for an extra life.The camera system is also referential to Super Mario 64, though inferior in implementation- the camera can get caught on walls quite easily, forcing the player to move blindly.There is a minigame based on cued-button presses, but the presses are not timed with the music and very difficult to get correctly. </div>  <div> Reception : Blues Brothers 2000 received mixed to negative reviews, and did not prove to be very popular- being released two years after its movie. Among the things most criticized in the game, the imprecise controls and the lackluster camera system were frequently mentioned. IGN claimed that half of the time they spent with the game was spent trying to get the camera working.Gamespot also said the game was buggy, complaining that they would get trapped in infinite damage loops. </div> "

The player takes the role of Adam Drake, a genetically-enhanced super soldier that travels back in time to save Earth from being destroyed by alien invaders.The game was developed by DMA Design (now known as Rockstar North), and due to that, it has many similarities with the Grand Theft Auto games, as the player uses a variety of weapons and vehicles to get through the game. This game's development actually precedes GTA 3 and gives birth to many of the concepts that would be used for the first 3D GTA game. While Nintendo was originally going to publish the game in America, they later backed out, with Midway replacing them as publisher. </div>  <div> Plot : Drive any vehicle you come acrossSince 1916, the Earth has been under constant attack by an alien force. These aliens (literally giant bugs) sought a food source and found that humans' bodies could be harvested to meet their needs (hence the name of the game). The bugs would attack a certain area of Earth, harvest bodies, then leave, only to appear again 25 years later. This is due to the fact that the invaders traveled through space aboard an artificial comet that orbits the sun. Every 25 years, their orbit would bring them close enough to Earth for attack. Attacks occurred in 1916, 1941, 1966, and 1991 until the human race was nearly instinct.In the year 2016, a few remaining human survivors orbit the Earth on a research station where they have been plotting to retake Earth. With the advent of time travel, they have formulated a plan to take genetically enhanced soldiers to the major events of the past in order to stop the alien harvest before it can annihilate the human race.Unfortunately, during the opening cinematic, the bugs attack the station, killing the majority of the crew. Adam Drake, the only surviving soldier, is injured in his escape, but manages to get to his ship and travel back in time to Greece 1916 before the aliens catch up to him. The bugs, however, take Adam's genetic material from a pool of blood he left behind due to his injury. This allows the aliens to clone Adam, and send the clone back in time to stop humanity's last hope. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player plays as Adam Drake as he travels to different times in the Earth's history as he repels the attacks of the alien invaders. There are two difficulties to chose from: Easy and Hero. </div>  <div> Trivia : The game has five stages: Greece in 1916, Java in 1941, America in 1966, Siberia 1991, and finally the Alien Comet in 2016. Each stage consists of a very large map, and is separated into at least three sections (divided by alien-generated shield walls) in which they must defeat an ""Alien Processor"" before moving on to the next section. After each Processor is dealt with, the player must destroy the shield generator and an end-stage boss. The end-stage bosses are primarily vehicle-based battles, while the Alien Processor sections can be taken on either on foot or using various vehicles found in the environment.During the Alien Processor sections, Daisy (Adam's female partner, who simply stay's in Adam's ship) gives the player missions to accomplish, such as visiting towns for clues, putting out fires with a firetruck, saving kids with an ice cream truck, or defending areas from Harvester waves. </div> "

Bomberman loses consciousness, and later awakes to find himself in a jail cell with the mysterious egg, but without the Fire Stone that allows him to use his trademark bombs. The egg hatches shortly afterwards, and the creature that emerges introduces himself as Pommy. Pommy is able to slip through the bars of the cell to retrieve Bomberman's Fire Stone, and with it Bomberman is able to escape. The two later learn that they were imprisoned by henchmen working for the Astral Knights, an evil group collecting the seven Elemental Stones. Bomberman and his new friend set out to stop the Astral Knights from executing whatever they're planning.The Story Mode has eight levels, each one a planet with a different theme. Each planet has a boss fight against one of the Astral Knights, six of whom carry an elemental stone. Gameplay is much like that of Bomberman 64, although 64's spherical explosions have been replaced with the traditional cross shaped explosions found in 2D entries of the series. One of the biggest additions to The Second Attack are the new types of bombs that Bomberman can use. After most boss fights Bomberman collects a new Elemental Stone that allows him to use a new type of bomb. These new bombs often must be used to advance past certain sections, such as using ice bombs to freeze water or wind bombs to blow Bomberman across a gap.The other big addition to The Second Attack is Pommy. At first Pommy can aid Bomberman by stunning enemies, but he can evolve into stronger forms with different attacks if Bomberman collects enough food. The type of food that Bomberman collects will affect what Pommy evolves into. Pommy can either be controlled by the AI or a second player. </div>  <div> Battle Mode : The Second Attack features five multiplayer modes; Survival, Battle Royal, King & Knights, Key Trial, and Score Attack. The options allow players to change the number of rounds it takes to win and the amount of time in each round. Some modes also have options for ghosts, sudden death, and shuffle.Survival Mode is the traditional Bomberman multiplayer mode. Four players try to blow each other up, and the last player left standing is declared the winner.In Battle Royal players receive ten points for killing another player, and lose five points for dying. The player with the most points when time runs out wins.Promotional art of Bomberman protecting his king from the opposing teamIn King & Knights the players are split into two teams and must protect an inanimate king while trying to kill the other team's kings. Each king has either 4, 7, or 10 hit points depending on how the player set the game up. Players can pick up and move either king, which is an integral part of ensuring they're safe.In Key Trial two keys are hidden within objects in the map, and players compete to collect both keys. If a player with a key is caught in an explosion they'll drop it, allowing any player to pick it back up. Unlike most other game modes, Key Trial is played in split-screen.In Score Attack players compete to accumulate the most points before time runs out is the winner. Points are acquired by blowing up animals or containers, and collecting the food they leave behind. Like Key Trial, Score Attack is played in split-screen. </div> "

This time around though, Bomberman's move set has been expanded and retuned. Now Bomberman can jump, throws bombs farther and has more lives. One major change for the series is the lack of a multi-player mode, and means that Hero focuses entirely on the single player experience while a new addition is the introduction of vehicles: a jetpack and a submarine suit that attach to Bomberman for certain segments.Once again, Bomberman must save the world from evil invaders, only this time they've kidnapped Princess Millian.

The original arcade version outside of Japan is unique as it uses original music and backgrounds while replacing the cutesy characters with a disembodied pair of hands turning a crank. Although this change was reverted back for the other international releases, it can still be found in the version included in the North American PS2 version of Taito Legends 2.The Japanese version was re-released later that year as Puzzle Bobble 2X, featuring an additional set of levels while adding a special holiday-themed attract mode.

The protagonist in Chameleon Twist is none other than a chameleon, who upon entering the mysterious hole is transformed into a humanoid form (albeit having chameleon characteristics).   </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players can choose from one of four chameleons to play as. However, the trademark character is Davey, the blue chameleon. As you progress through the game, you make your way through six platform filled levels, following the rabbit the entire journey, trying to find a way out of the bizarre world. Platforming in Chameleon Twist revolves around the use of your tongue, which acts as both a way of transportation and attacking. The tongue's powers allow the player to cling onto ledges and poles to advance across platforms and through levels, as well as lets the player attack enemies by grabbing them with the tongue and swallowing them. Or, as an alternative, the player can spit swallowed enemies back out to act as a projectile to eliminate other enemies. Sticking out the tongue also allows the player to control it using the analog stick, letting them curve it as opposed to it always heading in a straight line. Once the tongue reaches to its full length or is blocked by an obstruction, it will retract back into the chameleon's mouth. The tongue can also act similar to a pole used in pole vaulting, letting the player jump over large gaps that would otherwise be impassable.  </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Chameleon Twist features two types of multiplayer battle modes, in which (up to) four players play as one of four chameleons. The goal is to knock all of the other players off of the stage by shooting enemies at each other. Multiplayer options include four different difficulty settings, adjustable time lengths, and a choice of four stages for both the Time Trial and Battle Royal modes. </div> "

Yet again, a chameleon named Davey and his friends find themselves trapped in a strange realm that transforms then into a humanoid-chameleon creature. At the beginning of the game, the same mysterious white rabbit that appeared in the first is the cause of all of this, however this time it does not involve traveling into a magical hole. Instead, the rabbit merely knocks one of the chameleons (whichever the player chooses to play as) into the sky, and they suddenly enter the other realm.The player must once again navigate through platform levels in order to achieve his ultimate goal of leaving this realm in the sky, and at the end of each stage is a boss that the player must defeat before moving on. Use of the chameleon's tongue is still necessary for fighting enemies and navigating the levels, and Chameleon Twist 2 also adds a parachute ability, that allows the player to fall at a slower pace, and vertical swinging polls, rather than solely the horizontal poles found in the first game. There is no multiplayer in this game, however. </div> "

Conker's Bad Fur Day,Rare,RareNA THQPAL,5-Mar-01,n64,"A comedy platform adventure featuring Conker, a drunkard, foul-mouthed red squirrel trying to find his way home after he awakes hungover in the middle of a field with a fuzzy memory and only the clothes on his back to accompany him.",3030-10533,10533,0,3/4/2001,https://www.giantbomb.com/conkers-bad-fur-day/3030-10533/,OFLC: M15+," <div> Overview : Conker's Bad Fur Day was released on March 5th, 2001 for the Nintendo 64. Primarily designed by Chris Seavor (who also voiced Conker and the majority of the characters in the game), Bad Fur Day was a major tone change from previous platformers designed by Rare Studios, as it was designed for a mature audience, rather than young children. Many players were especially surprised with the game's mature theme given that the title was released on the N64, a platform that had garnered a reputation for being a more ""kid-friendly"" system than its rival, the Sony PlayStation.Rare also used Conker's Bad Fur Day to address many of the critical concerns made against their previous platformers, the Banjo- Kazooie franchise, as well as Donkey Kong 64. Critics argued that the games became overburdened by the player's need to collect too many items, losing the actual focus on tight gameplay and interesting levels in the process. To combat these claims, Conker's Bad Fur Day features no collectible items whatsoever. The game didn't even feature a real attack button. Instead, Conker would use ""Context Sensitive"" pads scattered throughout the level to instantly acquire the item or thing necessary to progress through the game.The significant amount of extreme content within the game, including use of severe profanity and violence, along with certain bodily functions, earned it a rating of BBFC 18 in the UK and Mature in the United States. There was some amount of censorship, including the blacking out of particularly gory parts of creatures or moments in the game. The words ""Fuck"" and ""Cock"" were censored by bleeps and symbols.The game is known for its many spoofs of multiple movies that were big around the time of the games release like The Matrix and Saving Private Ryan, as well as classics like A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs, and The Terminator.Conker attacks his enemies normally by using a frying pan but also there are some context sensitive areas which will allow Conker to use a special power such as: peeing on flame monsters, attack a big furnace's brass balls with bricks, and more. </div>  <div> Plot : At the start of the game, players meet Conker the Squirrel out drinking with his friends who are off to war the following morning. After the festivities, Conker stumbles out of the pub and tries to head home. Come sunrise, however, Conker awakens in a strange field with no recollection of the night's events. Breaking with tradition, the player begins the game with a staggering, hungover Conker, and must talk to a rather strange scarecrow named Birdy before receiving some milk to perk the squirrel up. Conker spends the entirety of the game searching for his home and trying to return to his girlfriend, Berri. Conker meets the Gregg the Grim Reaper, who tells him squirrels can have ""as many lives as they can get away with"", providing an explanation for the game's lives system; after all, it couldn't break from convention entirely.The Panther King wants to use Conker as a leg for his table, since one has gone missing. His disgruntled, wheelchair bound scientist, Professor von Kripplespak, meanwhile, begins plotting his revenge against his boss as he is sick of being ordered about so much. Little happens to advance this throughout the course of the game, but near the end, Conker and Berri are reunited and enlisted to work for Don Weaso, the Mafia boss. When the pair arrive at the vault they're instructed to rob, they find Weaso there with the Panther King and Professor von Kripplespak. Berri is shot to death by Weaso and Conker is made ready to be turned into a table leg. However, Professor von Kripplespak reveals there is a xenomorph inside the Panther King, which bursts forth from his chest and kills him. 'Von Kripplespak launches the safe into space, but Conker manages to isolate him within the air lock, launching him into the vacuum of space, allowing Conker to fight the xenomorph alone. As he is about to meet his doom at the hands of the xenomorph, the game ""freezes"" and Conker is allowed to ask the ""programmer"" for one thing. He chooses a katana and is transported back to the throne room where he kills his foe and is crowned king, in line with his vision at the start of the game. He would rather have had Berri back, however, and ambles back down to the pub where he gets drunk and stumbles off into the night again. </div>  <div> Locations : Conker's journey will take him through a series of bizarre locations and introduce him to a number of weird characters and bosses (most famously the Great Mighty Poo, an opera singing, living pile of excrement with sweetcorn for teeth). There were no real levels so to speak, as the game was essentially one large free-roaming area, with simple tasks to complete rather than the collection of items. The only real collectibles during the game are the wads of cash that Conker must retrieve in order to gain entry to a certain section later on. The locations themselves are well realized, including cold caverns, a clock tower, a prehistoric club, a caveman fighting arena, an enormous toilet bowl, a hill made entirely of shit, a farm, a beehive, a Batula's castle, a warzone and many others. </div>  <div> Chapters : The game followed a chapter based format, basically becoming ""levels,"" the chapters weren't announced in the game, but they typically followed the levels, which also weren't really announced either (as is, there wasn't a portal that said ""level one,"" things just blended together.) The chapters would also be used to replay areas of the game if they were unlocked from the main menu, eliminating the need to replay the entire game just to relive one moment. The chapters are as follows:Hung Over: Conker wakes up after wandering off in the wrong direction, waking up hung over in a strange world. He is greeted by a scarecrow named Birdy. This level is more of a tutorial.Windy: This is the ""hub world,"" and so this chapter is actually considered to be ongoing throughout the adventure, because it shows up oh so many times. The first time, conker is charged with killing a bunch of wasps who have taken away the queen bee's hive.Barn Boys: This chapter follows Conker as he walks into a farm, comprised of talking blocks that want you to get rid of a mouse, a sexually suggestive flower, suicidal pitchforks, and a Terminator-type hay monster.Bats Tower: This chapter follows Conker working with Catfish to get some money, along the way, he helps a perverted Cog (with a gay Cog on his other side which takes control when Conker turns him over) who makes him put some ladies on his long pole, additionally, Conker gets to fight a boiler with some large steel balls, and parody jaws with a bulldog fish.Sloprano: Conker investigates the giant mountain of poo, gets cows to poop through a funnel so dung beetles can make him a dung ball, and fights the infamous Great Mighty Poo.Uga Buga: Conker convinces weasel guards that he's an elephant, and visits a nice but completely misplaced land of cavemen and dinosaurs, there he gets into private clubs, gets hired by the mafia, and fights in an arena to prove he's got the biggest bones of all.Spooky: Conker goes downstream during the night time and learns about the scary side of the world, where he helps a vampire get some blood off the weekly villager raid, and gets to fight off more zombies then you'd want to.It's War: War has broken out between the SHC (Squirrels) and the Tediz. Conker is enlisted, storms their beaches, and takes them all down single-handedly.Heist: Conker meets Barry again, gets re-hired by the Weasel mafia, and robs a bank all the while spoofing the Matrix. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Conker base mechanics don't differ wildly from Rare's other N64 platformers. Players can use a jump button to get Conker over obstacles, while a second tap of the button will give Conker an increased length of jump by utilising his bushy tail to hover for a few seconds. Camera controls are mapped to the C buttons on the N64 game pad.What makes Conker's Bad Fur Day interesting, however, is that the above accounts for the majority of Conker's gameplay mechanics. Rather than providing Conker with a slew of unique abilities, mapped to every single button the N64 controller (as in the Banjo-Kazooie games and Donkey Kong 64), Conker features an all purpose ""Context Sensitive"" button. All throughout the game world in Conker's Bad Fur Day, the player will encounter ""B Pads"", which ask that they push the button on the controller as a light-bulb appears over Conker's head (B's default action was to attack with his trusty frying pan). If this simple action is performed, Conker will magically pull out the item, vehicle or weapon necessary to progress through the game. The actions performed from the pads differ wildly from each other, but more often than not affect Conker's immediate surroundings. This feature (inspired in no small part by the Context Sensitive A button in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) put a greater emphasis on performing actions within the gameworld that would have a tangible effect on the area itself, rather than simply the collection of shiny objects that had no real impact within the world but allowed the player to progress (see Banjo's ""Note Doors"" and Mario 64's Star based progression). The Context Sensitive buttons kept the game focused on story, puzzles and gameplay, a welcome change for fans of the genre convinced that Rare's previous collect-a-thons were responsible for the decline of the 3-D platformer straight after its very rapid rise. It was certainly a new take on the platforming genre, and adult gamers welcomed a more mature (or immature as it may well be) take on the template.Some notable powerups are:Using toilet roll to defeat the Great Might Poo.Urinating on angry Rock Men.A catapult.Activating a trough of prune juice to make cows defecate.Conker additionally competes in a number of challenges that aren't in line with the rest of the game's style of play. For instance, he has to ride a bull hitting targets, a raptor as it eats cavemen and pilots a hoverboard in a race. He is also transformed into a blood sucking bat in the Vampire's castle.The game was also notable for its large number of novel and well constructed movie parodies. Players would engage in sequences directly inspired by The Terminator, Reservoir Dogs, The Untouchables, The Wizard of Oz, The Godfather, Eyes Wide Shut, Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, Dracula, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Blue Velvet, Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, Alien, Full Metal Jacket, Scarface, The Matrix and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, among other references. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : In the multiplayer portion of the game you can play in a variety of modes.Tanks - Simple, you have a tank and on the map are various power-ups to kill other tanks easier, and faster. In the center of the map is a can of gas, your objective is to place the can of gas in a bunker to kill everyone who is outside . The exciting part of this mode is that once the gas has been released it becomes one big game of musical chairs to see who can find a bunker to live.War - Two bases stand off from one another-one for the Tediz and one for the Squirrels. This mode also features a can of gas in each sides base. The mode plays basically like capture the flag with the same rush-to-get-to-a-safe-zone found in tanks.Race - In race you play cavemen who have hoverboards and race over giant lava rivers. This mode features basic racing format with three laps (or a time limit) and various ramps and weapons.Heist - In Heist, you play a game like neutral capture the flag, but instead of a flag, the game has a bag of money. The player's objective is to get the bag of money and manage to take it back to your color base to score. This mode manages to be fun with tons of weaponry and a nice large level.Raptor - In Raptor you play a caveman who must sneak into a velociraptor nest, steal an egg, and run with the egg back to your base where you drop it in a giant frying pan. The problem here is that you must avoid the angry mother velociraptor. Luckily you are armed with crossbows, throwing knives, and clubs to deal with the raptors.Beach - In Beach you can play as either Squirrel Frenchman or Tediz Soldiers. As the Squirrels you must charge the beach avoiding fire from the Tediz and make it to the other side of the map. As the Tediz you must prevent the Squirrels from making it through the map.Capture the Flag - Finally the dedicated CTF, this is simple. The sad thing is Rare didn't bother to put any neat spin on this mode as they did with the others. The map is rather small but very frantic.Deathmatch - Deathmatch is a basic kill-your-enemies mode. The neat thing about deathmatch is you can play it on seven different maps in the game one from every other mode. </div>  <div> Development : Conker's Bad Fur Day was initially a standard platformer, echoing the likes of Rare's Banjo games and Mario 64. It was called Conker's Quest and later, Twelve Tails: Conker 64. This version was much cuter and ""kiddy-oriented"", featuring none of the features that truly made Conker stand out from the crowd. Trailers for the game were met with a muted reception at E3, as this would be the third similar Rare franchise on a console already rife with platforming titles to choose from. Rare themselves realized this, and decided to redo the entire experience. Inspired by the cute looking but adult cartoon, South Park, Chris Seavor, the game's producer, thought taking the game to more mature and controversial territory would be an interesting direction to go in. Thus, the team announced they'd be making the Conker's Bad Fur Day we know today, and work on the project began in earnest. Initially, gamers didn't believe Rare's decision, claiming it was an April fool's joke. </div>  <div> Xbox Version : In 2004, an Xbox version titled Conker: Live and Reloaded was released. It contained an enhanced (though more heavily censored) version of the original game, plus a whole new online component. It was well liked by the game press, though less adored than the original release, possibly because of the slightly aged nature of the game and the fairly bog-standard shooting of the multiplayer. </div>  <div> The Great Mighty Poo's Song : The Great Mighty PooI am the Great Mighty Poo and I’m going to throw my shit at you.A huge supply of tish comes from my chocolate starfish.How about some scat, you little twat?Do you really think you’ll survive in here?You don’t seem to know which creek you’re in.Sweet corn is the only thing that makes it through my rear.How do you think I keep this lovely grin?Have some more caviar.Now I’m really getting rather mad.You’re like a niggly, tickly, shitty little tag nut.When I’ve knocked you out with all my babI’m going to take your head and ram it up my butt.

The screen would then fade to black and we would hear a gunshot, so in other words, he committed suicide. However that ending was scrapped as it did not really leave much room for a sequel, so instead we have an ending that is more open. Ironically, when Chris Seavour was asked about a Conker sequel, he said it would focus on the evil Tediz and Conker would have been killed in the first scene. </div> "

Meanwhile, Timber enlists the remaining inhabitants of the island to join Taj the Genie's resistance against the evil Wizpig. However, Wizpig has been doing some recruitment of his own, and he has used his dark magic to hypnotize the island's four guardians Tricky the Triceratops, Bubbler the Octopus, Bluey the Walrus and Smokey the Dragon into becoming his henchmen. Furthermore, Wizpig has transformed the island's champion racer Drumstick into a frog in order to neutralize the speedy rooster as a potential threat to his new regime.Diddy and the other resistance members race against Wizpig's minions across each of the island's different areas, completing all their challenges in order to end the sinister swine's reign of terror over Timber's Island.

There were two kinds of collectibles spread throughout the levels; one was letters, which when put together spelledOne Of The Bonus LevelsT-A-R-Z-A-N, aswell as 4 pieces of a ""jigsaw"" (of sorts), which when put together revealed a mosaic of a monkey's face. If the player found all the letters, they would be granted to a bonus level of some sort. These varied from either a young Tarzan floating down a river, to an older Tarzan riding an Ostrich. In these levels the player has 30 seconds to get as many coins as possible before time runs out, aswell as an unspecified red fruit that, when caught, extends the time available by 5 seconds. Whereas if the player catches all four pieces of the mosaic they would be treated to a movie clip, pulled directly from the animated Disney movie. These are mainly used to extend the plot, beyond the regular cutscenes inbetween levels. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay is largely 2D basic platforming, although with one or two 3D mini-games thrown in. One that is prominently used is the view switching behind Tarzan as he slides down a massive tree branch. The player must duck, jump and lean right or left in order to avoid objects and therefore get all the coins. There are two levels in the game where theplayer will be controlling a character other than Tarzan. In the level Baboon Chase the player takes control of Jane; an English lady who serves as Tarzan's love interest throughout the game. Aswell as in the level Trashing The Camp the player takes control of Turk; a baboon who serves as Tarzan's best friend during his childhood. </div>  <div> Plot : The plot of the game closely resembles the plot of the film largely because the only remnants of a story are put forward by movie clips directly pulled from the 1999 animated motion picture. The player goes through 4 levels as young Tarzan, before going through a montage of Tarzan getting progressively older. From this point on the player controls ""Old"" Tarzan (like Old Snake, but not). There is a sub-boss halfway through the game, where Tarzan defeats the Cheetah, in a similiar situation to how the events occur in the movie. The last level culminates in a showdown with Clayton, the main antagonist in the game. Similiar to many games of the time period, the final boss battle is reliant on Pattern Recognition, and must be taken advantage of in order to defeat Clayton. </div> "

Years after the UAC began bombarding their abandoned installations with heavy doses of radiation to exterminate the remaining demons, they receive a signal that a single demonic entity with vast rejuvenative powers has managed to elude their sensors and resurrect a demon army. As the one most experienced against this threat, the space marine is sent in alone to eradicate this new force.Doom 64 later received two unofficial conversions to the PC using modern Doom source ports: Doom 64: Absolution and Doom64 EX (the latter of which requires a ROM dump of the original game to run). Doom64 EX is notable for leading to the creation of the KEX Engine (which is used in numerous game re-releases, such as the ones for Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Forsaken, and System Shock) and was used as the base for an enhanced re-release of the game.The enhanced re-release was developed by Nightdive Studios and published by Bethesda on March 20, 2020 for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Originally released as a pre-order bonus for Doom Eternal, this version adds modern graphical options (such as widescreen support) and updated controls (with additional motion control support for the PS4 and NSW versions) while adding a brand new six-level epilogue episode. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game's title screen demoThe core gameplay of Doom 64 remains the same as that of its predecessors: players assume the role of a lone space marine exploring dozens of demon-infested levels from a first-person perspective, with the ultimate goals of reaching each level's exit and eventually defeating the game's final boss. Most levels contain one or more keycards that must be collected to reach the exit, as well as hidden rooms that may hold useful items. </div>  <div> Enemies : Players begin the game with only their fists and a basic pistol, but they can expand their arsenal up to a total of ten different weapons over the course of the campaign. All non-melee weapons require ammunition to use. </div>  <div> Levels : The player's basic melee attack. Due to its low damage per hit, the Fist is typically used only as a last resort after exhausting all other weapons. However, picking up a Berserk Pack increases the Fist's melee damage tenfold, making it possible to gib weaker enemies with a single punch. </div>  <div> Story : A more powerful melee weapon that is very effective against lesser demons. Like the Fist, the Chainsaw does not consume ammo, but players must close the distance to attack enemies with it. </div>  <div> Ports and Re-releases : The game's starter firearm sports a slow rate of fire and relatively weak damage. The Pistol becomes largely obsolete once the Chaingun is acquired, as they both share the same type of ammo. </div> "

Duke Nukem 3D,3D RealmsEurocom,GT Interactive,31-Oct-97,n64,Kill countless aliens while rescuing babes as Duke Nukem in this critically acclaimed first-person shooter.,3030-3407,3407,0,1/29/1996,https://www.giantbomb.com/duke-nukem-3d/3030-3407/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : An alien invasion has begun on Earth. The aliens are turning police officers into Pig Cops, abducting women and impregnating them with alien fetal spawn, and generally causing massive death and destruction across a variety of locations. As Duke Nukem, players will make use of a variety of unique weapons, such as the Devastator, Shrink-ray or Freezethrower, all in the name of saving Earth's women and busting alien skulls. For the first time in the series, the franchise was taken to a first-person perspective and took the big rival franchise of Doom head-on. The gaming market was filled with first-person shooters at the time of release, but Duke Nukem 3D's unique mix of setting, attitude, and sense of humor made the game into an instant hit. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The first level of the game.Duke Nukem 3D was a technical step forward for the first-person shooter genre at the time of release. The player was able to crouch, jump, and look up and down, which allows for more interesting level design and enemy placements than was previously seen in other games in the genre. To complete a level, the player must find the exit marker, which is depicted as a nuclear symbol, and press it. To reach the exit, the player must often search the level for key cards and open their corresponding doors. Unlike many other games in the genre at the time of release, the levels of Duke Nukem 3D took place in relate-able and recognizable real-world locations such as movie theaters, streets, Chinese restaurants, and even strip clubs.Another aspect of the level design that made Duke Nukem 3D stand out from other games in the genre at the time of release, was the unseen high amount of interactivity the player had with the game-world. Players have various ways of interacting with the environment; light switches can be turned on/off, urinals can be used, water can be drunk, strippers can be tipped, etc.Duke Nukem frequently spouts one-liners; the majority of which are lifted directly from various movies with heavy cult followings like Big Trouble in Little China, Army of Darkness, They Live, and others.Duke Nukem 3D contains a big roster of enemies ranging from simple sharks to huge missile-firing Assault Commanders. The enemies all have different characteristics and attributes, which allowed the designers to create interesting combinations to challenge the player. To overcome the enemies, the player had a wide range of very different and unique weapons at his disposal. Besides the traditional firearms such as a pistol and a shotgun, Duke Nukem 3D includes many innovative weapons such as the shrink ray, pipe bombs and the freezethrower.To further aid the player in their victory, the game includes various different useable items such as first aid kit, scuba gear, body armor; and more unconventional items such as Holoduke, steroids, and a jetpack. The Holoduke allows the player to place a copy of themself in the world for a limited time to confuse enemies, the Steroids allow the player to move faster for a limited time, and the jetpack enables the player to fly within the boundaries of the levels. </div>  <div> Technology : Co-operative play.Duke Nukem 3D on the PC offers multiplayer via LAN and modem-based services for up to 8 players. The game's multiplayer can take place on the levels from the game's single-player as well as some included multiplayer-only levels. The included editor also allows the players to play on their own created levels. Duke Nukem 3D shipped with two modes of multiplayer, and a third was added in the Plutonium Pak.Co-operative allows the players to team up and play single-player levels together.Dukematch is the deathmatch of Duke Nukem 3D. The first player to reach a certain score, or being on top of the scoreboard when the time runs out, is declared the winner. It is also possible to set up teams, so that the players both have allies and enemies in the same match.Duke Tag is akin to the capture the flag game mode. This game mode is not available from any menu, but is in fact hidden in level E4L10. If the level in Dukematch is started with at least four players present, a switch at the starting area of player 1 will become visible. Pressing this switch will enable Duke Tag mode, and the players will have to choose whether they want to be on Green or Brown team by walking into a teleporter.When a game is in progress it is possible to communicate with the other players by typing chat messages. It is additionally possible to taunt the other players by making use of the game's 12 pre-recorded Duke Nukem one-liners. These can be played by pressing ""Alt"" + ""F1""-""F12"" during play. </div>  <div> Expansions : Almost as important as the game itself was Duke Nukem 3D's use of Ken Silverman's Build Engine. The Build Engine allowed for rooms to be built directly above another, sloped surfaces, and even moving geometry. The player is able to interact with the environment in revolutionary ways, causing buildings to collapse, blasting holes in walls, riding moving tramways, as well as other ways to interact with the environment. </div>  <div> Enemies : The High Resolution Pack for Duke Nukem 3D.The source code for Duke Nukem 3D v1.5 was released as open-source on April 1st 2003, and fans quickly begun porting the game to different operating systems. As of 2010, the game supports online multiplayer and several 3D engines exist which allow the game to be enjoyed by fans with newer, higher quality graphics - the most popular being EDuke32. To further enhance the visual quality of the game, a community project is creating high-resolution textures and 3D models for the game.EDuke32 - Windows/Linux/Mac OSX port.High Resolution Pack - New textures and 3D models. </div>  <div> Weapons : In the wake of Duke Nukem 3D's success, the game received four expansion packs:Plutonium Pak was the first expansion pack for Duke Nukem 3D and the only one created by 3D Realms themselves. The expansion added the 4th episode ""The Birth"" consisting of 11 new levels, and introduced a new weapon (the Microwave Expander), two new types of enemies, and a new boss. The Plutonium Pak upgrades Duke Nukem 3D from version 1.13d to version 1.4 which is dubbed ""The Atomic Edition"".Duke it out in D.C. was developed by Sunstorm Interactive and was the first expansion pack not developed by 3D Realms. This expansion adds a new episode, in which Duke Nukem heads to the white house to save President Clinton. This expansion did not alter any of the enemy types or weapons.Duke: Nuclear Winter was developed by Simply Silly Software with permission from 3D Realms. The expansion added a new episode in which Duke Nukem heads to the North Pole to kill an alien-controlled Santa Claus. The expansion adds new enemies, such as snowmen and elves, and new music.Duke Caribbean: Life's a Beach was the second expansion developed by Sunstorm Interactive and the last official expansion for Duke Nukem 3D. The expansion adds a new Caribbean-themed episode with areas like hotels, swimming pools, and beaches. Furthermore, the expansion altered the visual appearance of every weapon and enemy. </div>  <div> Episodes & Levels : The enemy roster of Duke Nukem 3D consists primarily of different types of aliens with aid from mechanical/robotic machinery. The enemies are shown as 2D sprites in-game due to the limitation of the Build Engine, which mean they appear as flat and paper-like. In the Nintendo 64 version, the last boss (the Cycloid Emperor) was remade as a fully 3D polygonal model. The enemies are listed in order of appearance. </div>  <div> Ports & other Versions : The standard enemies populate the levels of Duke Nukem 3D. Six enemies are introduced in the game's first episode, five in the second, one in the third, and two in the fourth. </div>  <div> Music : One of the weakest and most common enemies in the game. The assault troopers often appear in groups and have the ability to use a jet-pack to attack the player from different altitudes, but their low amount of HP prevents them from becoming a serious threat to the player; a single shotgun blast, or a few pistol rounds, is enough to kill it. Despite using alien laser guns for their attacks, they may drop Pistol ammo upon death for the player to pick up. </div>  <div> Links : An upgraded version of the assault trooper. They have the same amount of HP as the Assault Trooper, but instead of having the ability to use a jet-pack, they can teleport. Upon using the teleportation skill, the Assault Captain will disappear for a few seconds, only to appear again - usually behind the player if possible. Just like the assault troopers, the assault captains may drop pistol ammo upon death despite using alien laser guns for their attacks. </div> "

You play through different levels, and unlock more locations by collecting Golden Udders, while new levels in each location can be obtained by collecting Jim's Marbles. Like in previous Earthworm Jim games, Your primary weapon will be your blaster gun. </div>  <div> Plot : Earthworm Jim is struck by a cow flying through the air, and is then induced in a coma. Jim awakes in his mind and becomes crazy. Jim's previous enemies are also in his mind, and if not defeated, Jim will be stuck in his coma forever. He has unleashed his super ego to stop the madness happening in his mind. Jim must collect all of the Golden Udders to restore his sanity. As you travel around his own mind, Jim has four area to explore in order to restore his health (and more importantly, his sanity). The four areas Jim must explore is also where he must collect his marbles, which, not only determines how smart Jim really is, but can unlock future levels by collecting a certain amount of marbles. With this in mind, Jim must travel deeper into his mind to get rid of his enemies. The first area Jim explores is his Memory, along with his old foe, Psycrow. Inside Jim relives his early childhood of a war and other manly things a worm must remember. Collecting all the Golden Udders in this area allows Jim to travel into another part of his just after he defeats Psycrow in a good, old fashioned Pig Surfing contest. Jim must collect 100 marbles before Psycrow in order to win (and all the boss battles are this way as well so it's good to practice now while you get the chance). A big catch is that you have to watch your health at the same time so it's best not to get hit with anything and hope that you can collect everything before Psycrow does. The second area Jim must explore is his Happiness. In here, nothing but food and anything Jim really loves the most is in this part of his brain. However, another foe is around here as well and that would be Fatty Roswell, an alien with an obvious problem of eating way too much, with a goal to make Jim's mind the perfect place to dine forever. A tough boss to crack as he has the ability to teleport around the area, making it hard to collect all the marbles to win. Jim swallows his pride and sticks his chest out, the next area he must face is his Fear. Everything that he fears the most can be found in this area and adds even more rooms then the previous area, just to see Jim wet himself. In here, he must face ghost chickens and dancing zombies in order to restore his sanity. Another foe is lurking in the darkness and that is Professor Monkey for a Head and his never ending quest to torture poor Jim forever using his greatest fears. Just when you think Jim can't do much else at this point, he must then travel into his Fantasy, where growing up as a worm, he will be the Worm of the West and stop the bandits from harming his mind anymore. His last foe in this part of his mind is Bob the Goldfish and Number 4 (a cat) who will stop at nothing to make sure Jim doesn't restore his sanity and leave him trapped in a coma forever. </div> "

In addition, it changes the race formula to remove the lap-based boost limits (where boosting now takes up the vehicle's energy gauge instead), improve collision-based combat (where players can utilize side and spin attacks to damage opposing machines), and remove the per-lap disqualification system. Rather than use generic opponents, the game introduces a full 30-machine roster, each with unique machine characteristics.Along with the traditional Grand Prix mode (where a point-based ranking system, similar to the Mario Kart series, is now used), the game includes updated Practice and Time Attack modes (where any course can be used), split-screen multiplayer in VS Battle (with up to four players racing at one time), and a unique ""Death Race"" mode (where players attempt to eliminate all opponents in a specialized course as fast as they can). The game includes a new set of 24 courses, 18 of which are unlocked from the start, and an unlockable procedurally-generated course.The game later received an expansion in the form of the F-Zero X Expansion Kit, released exclusively in Japan for the 64DD disk drive peripheral on April 21, 2000. Requiring the original game itself, this expansion features additional music tracks, new courses, and the ability to create custom machines, courses, and Cups.The game (sans the expansion) was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (in 2007) and Wii U (in 2016-2017). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The main mode of F-Zero X in which there are five cups selectable (two of them have to be unlocked like the X Cup, a cup filled of randomly generated courses). Four difficulties are also selectable (Master as to be unlocked). With more cars on the track (30 to be exact), the racing is fast and chaotic as opposing racers will bump the player's car as well as a rival driver the player has to beat. Whoever has the highest number of points wins the cup after five courses. Like the original F-Zero, the car has a health meter and will lose one life if it brakes down (health is at zero) or fall off the stage. Also from the original, boosting is in as soon as the second lap begins as using it takes off a portion of the car's health. </div>  <div> Machines : This mode is the player's car and only their car going through a certain course as fast as possible. </div>  <div> Circuits : The goal of this mode is to take out all the competition as fast as possible. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Up to four players locally can compete on any of the courses. </div> "

Skorne wasn't so into the idea of having a master, so he turned on Garm and banished him to the depths of the Underworld. Following that, he scattered the runestones used to summon him across the four realms of the world in an attempt to prevent anyone from gathering them again. Players are thrust into the role of recovering four keys and the thirteen runestones from the different worlds in order to defeat Skorne. The four original characters from the original Gauntlet--Warrior, Valkyrie, Archer, and Wizard--return in Legends. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The combat of Legends revolves around the use of basic ranged attacks, basic melee attacks, magic, and potent power attacks. Each character has their own cosmetic variance of attacks but combat is mechanically similar.Melee and ranged attacks are used at their respective distances. Magic can be used in one of three ways: an explosion of magic going outward from the character, a damaging shield that surrounds the character, or a thrown potion that explodes when it hits the ground. Power attacks can come in three different varieties. The kind of power attack is determined by a meter above the character's section at the bottom of the screen. The meter slowly fills up as the player causes more damage. The first (or green) level attack produces a more powerful version of the character's normal melee attack. The second (or yellow) level attack produces a 360-degree attack. The third and final (or red) level attack produces an indestructible projectile attack that annihilates any enemies in its path. </div> "

Palmer Productions (Game Boy Color port). The game was published by Midway Games (Nintendo 64 releases), Crystal Dynamics (US PlayStation release), BMG Interactive Entertainment (UK PlayStation release), Bandai (Japanese PlayStation release), Eidos (US PC release), Square Enix (PlayStation Vita PSone Classics release), and Ubisoft Entertainment (Outside of the US PC releases). </div>  <div> Story : No game is complete without zombiesGex: Enter the Gecko follows the adventures of the bipedal lizard Gex, an old (at this point retired) action game hero who has lost his passion for adventure and has slumped into a state of intense apathy, now spending every waking second watching TV, ordering Chinese food, eating Chinese food, or watching TV while eating Chinese food. After what could be years in this state, Gex's routine is interrupted by Rez, an old arch-nemesis who wants only to annoy Gex and destroy the world by combining the forces of various TV villains and running rampage on the real world. Gex, co-opted by the government and a crowbar is then tasked to go and save the world again.Gex's struggle takes him from old rerun series to old rerun series as he collects TV remotes to try and turn off the plans of Rez. To aid him in his quest Gex can wear special suits to feel more at home in the show he's in and break old TVs to gain powerup bugs that reside inside such as fire and ice breath, 1ups, health pickups, and others. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay revolved around collecting remotes by completing objectives or reaching the end of a level. These were red remotes that were collected as Gex completed either specific objectives that, when selected from the TV in the hub world Gex would receive a clue for, though any objective could be completed regardless of what hint was chosen. These remotes served a similar function to Mario 64's Power Stars or Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies.There are also white or silver remotes that are unlocked either by collecting 3 different tiers of items which varied from level to level, but always had some joke attached to them or amusing significance, or by finding the hidden white remote in a level. These remotes unlocked the special stage areas where the player can unlock yellow remotes that when every remote was collected, the ""true"" ending of the game was shown when the player defeats REX in the final boss.The game largely revolved around its 3D platforming. Gex has a variety of moves at his disposal to defeat enemies. Between the spin attack where he would spin his tail around in a sweeping motion, the coil jump which had the added bonus of launching Gex further up (though slowing his forward momentum) and the kung-fu kick which launched Gex forward straight into his enemy but inflicting slightly more damage than a spin kick, Gex was sorted.Camera control and player movement can be controlled with both left and right analog sticks as well as the D-pad and shoulder buttons. Entering a first person mode is done when both shoulders are held. The game also has a Metroid-style password system so that those who could not (or did not) use a memory card could carry over their remote completion over to their next play session. This, however, did not save the number of extra lives. </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Port : Gex features a large selection of levels that were all accessed via a large hub-world. The levels are inspired by different movie genres. Examples:Toon TV: A parody of Looney Toons. Gex, over the course of different levels will turn into an anthropomorphic rabbit character, a large duck, and fight giant cartoon styled enemies.Scream TV: A tongue-in-cheek homage to horror movies. Gex must contend with ghosts, Frankenstein's monster, zombies, mummies, bats, and giant bouncing skulls as he made his way through dressed like Dracula.Sea-Span: Centered around a Titanic-like ship. Exclusive to the N64 version.Circuit Central: A Tron-styled world that, like its inspiration, takes place inside a computer-styled world. There were really annoying floating electric things everywhere.Kung-Fu Theatre: A group of levels which featured a whole pile of ninjas, throwing stars, and giant death traps. Controlled by an evil pig named Mooshoo Pork, who is the boss of the second area.Rocket Channel: A Star Wars/Star Trek-themed level with no regard for subtlety in its references and had Gex dress up like Luke Skywalker.The Pre-History Channel: Tarzan-themed world too that took place in ancient times. Dinosaurs are everywhere, and there was far too much lava. Gex dressed as a caveman. </div>  <div> Reception : The Game Boy Color port of the game features the same stages as the console versions but are much smaller in size. The Game Boy Color port is also played in a 2D side-scrolling style rather than the polygonal 3D platforming of the console versions. </div> "

Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,Player 1,Titus Software,16-Nov-00,n64,"Largely reminiscent of Ocarina of Time, the game plays like a Zelda-lite adventure. Due to a combination of this, goofy dialogue, and a variety of technical issues; the game is not remembered fondly.",3030-10682,10682,0,11/16/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/hercules-the-legendary-journeys/3030-10682/,," <div> Overview : Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color game from Titus (based on the hit television show). It centers around one of the most popular Grecian myths, that of Heracles, or, as he is better known, Hercules. The game involves a combination of skirmishes with random enemies and bosses, elementary puzzles, and numerous trading sequences and side quests similar to the ones found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The player can also play as two of Herc's friends, Lolaus and Serena (or the Golden Hind, as the half woman, half horse character is referred to in the game): they each have their own unique attacks and weapons. Legendary Journeys is known to have many bugs and technical issues (alongside its clunky controls) that make the game frustrating and unnecessarily difficult in numerous places. This game proved to be another high profile failure for the once beloved Titus as it continued to plunge deeper into the territory of poorly developed action/adventure games; directly following the release of the critically-despised Superman 64. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Though Hercules is the primary player character, the player does take control of Lolaus and the Golden Hind during certain moments of the game. Each of these characters have a unique control scheme; unfortunately, perhaps due to a lack of care in the game's development, the other two characters are both exceedingly difficult to control and considerably weaker than Hercules. Nonetheless, the character's attributes are listed below: Hercules - The strongest and most primarily used of the characters, Hercules' primary attack is the punch by way of pressing the B button. Upon holding the B button, Hercules can also use a ""super punch"" that does greater damage and can be used to break through weakened walls. Furthermore, although all characters will stun enemies after a certain number of hits (bosses excluded), Hercules is the only character capable of picking up and throwing enemies; instantly killing both the enemy and any other enemies with which the thrown one makes contact. Furthermore, Herc is the only character that can purchase potions from the tavern owner (who exists in all of the game's towns) that unleash lavish special attacks centered around four elements: earth, fire, lightning, and ice. The earth potion drops rocks from the sky upon his unexpecting enemies; the fire potion unleashes burning balls of molten lava upon Herc's adversaries; the lightning potion performs a similar attack by way of giant, thundering lightning bolts; and the ice potion temporarily freezes one's foe(s). These potions are accessed via the C buttons. Although Hercules is the most overpowered of the game's characters, his portions can be nonetheless difficult to play due to a weak camera and the lack of a lock-on system.Iolaus - The sidekick of Hercules, Iolaus is useful as the only character in the game capable of climbing vines (which have an odd graphical similarity to those in Ocarina of Time). However, once he has climbed said vines and reached whatever dangers await him at the top, he is faced with the difficulty of fighting with his exceedingly underpowered staff (perhaps he is Herc's sidekick for a reason, eh?). Iolaus is also useful in one instance in which the snowy alps can only be crossed by a body small enough to fit into the only available winter coat. Iolaus cannot leave any of his designated playable areas however, if the player tries, they are met with the message: ""Perhaps I should let Herc take care of this.""The Golden Hind - Though christened Serena in the television series, the game (for some unbeknownst reason) refers to her as The Golden Hind. This lady Centaur is, in fact, the weakest of the three characters. The Hind's only method of attack is the shooting of her arrows, done in a first person mode. Although the arrows can be shot in the standard third-person perspective, they are guaranteed to strike nothing unless the enemy lies directly in front of the Hind. The first-person mode is troubling however, as the controls are so unbearably clunky and difficult to use that the player will have almost certainly lost a considerable amount of health by the time he/she was even capable of training his/her sights upon his/her adversaries. Fortunately, The Golden Hind also has the smallest amount of game time between the three characters; and, like Lolaus, is restrained to her respective areas with a message identical to his. </div> "
Hexen,Raven SoftwareSoftware Creations,id Software/GT InteractiveNA/PALGamebankJP,31-May-97,n64,"A fantasy first-person shooter that builds upon its predecessor, Heretic, by incorporating three character classes, multi-level puzzles, and eight-player network play.",3030-22548,22548,0,10/30/1995,https://www.giantbomb.com/hexen/3030-22548/,BBFC: 12," <div> Overview : Hexen (sometimes known as HeXen: Beyond Heretic) is a fantasy first-person shooter developed by Raven and published by id on October 30, 1995 for the PC. It is the second game in the Serpent Riders trilogy (between Heretic and Hexen II). The story takes place in the realm of Cronos, which was overtaken by the Serpent Rider Korax. The player controls one of three heroes ( Baratus the Fighter, Parias the Cleric, or Daedolon the Mage) as they set out to destroy Korax.The game builds upon the same engine used in Heretic (which uses a heavily-modified id Tech 1, the same engine used in Doom). In addition to the modifications found in Heretic, Hexen also includes jumping, multiple classes, rotating/moveable walls, weather effects, a level scripting system, CD audio, FMV cutscenes (for the CD version only), eight player multiplayer, and a system of interconnected levels (called ""hubs""). The source code for this engine was released twice: one in 1999 under a restrictive license and one in 2008 under the GNU General Public License.The game was published for the Mac in 1996 by GT Interactive (who also oversaw distribution of the PC version). In early 1997, the game was ported to the Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn (all which were published by GT Interactive). The Nintendo 64 version, ported by Software Creations, includes split-screen multi-player ( for up to four players) and text narratives in the loading screens of each level (describing each level). The PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions were ported by Probe, and includes graphical restrictions (less detailed architecture, less monster sprites, etc.) and lower frame rate. The PlayStation version does not support multi-player, while the Sega Saturn version includes two-player link-up multiplayer only accessible via a hidden cheat code. </div>  <div> Characters : Hexen was one of the first first-person shooters to let the player choose between one of three unique classes, each with their own unique attributes, weapons, and item effects. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Tougher and more agile than the other classes, the fighter specializes in melee combat. His only weakness is his lack of ranged attacks.Spiked Gauntlets - The fighter's starting weapon. Deals three powerful punches in quick succession at very close range.Timon's Axe - Its power and effectiveness is determined by how much blue mana the hero has. Although blue mana is not needed to swing the weapon, blue mana is required for a powerful electric swing.Hammer of Retribution - On close range, it's slow and does great damage. But if the hero has green mana, the hammer can fire an exploding projectile, making it an ideal long-range weapon for the class.Quietus - A big sword surrounded by green flames. Throws five green fireballs across the screen in a single swing. Uses up both green and blue mana and cannot be used like a melee weapon. </div>  <div> Deathkings of the Dark Citadel : Despite the class name, the cleric does not heal others. A balanced character with a lot of specialized weapons.Mace of Contrition - Although it is less powerful than the fighter's spiked gauntlets, this mace has a longer range.Serpent Staff - Uses blue mana for two purposes. At long range, it fires two green fireballs in a wave that, while weak, deals poisonous damage. At short range, it drains the health of the opponent, healing the hero in the process.Firestorm - Uses green mana to shoot a streak of fire from the hero's hands across a set distance, causing explosion damage in the process.Wraithverge - Uses both blue and green mana to fire a gray cloud that immediately splits into four powerful ghosts. Shrieking, these fast ghosts lock in to enemies and drain a lot of damage before moving on to the next enemy. (Or disappearing once the attack is over) </div> "

Despite a high level of hype due to the lack of RPGs on the N64, the  game was met with lukewarm reviews and low sales in the wake of the  release of Ocarina of Time.   </div>  <div> Exploration  : During exploration, Hybrid Heaven plays similar to 3D adventure games, such as Tomb Raider - the player must navigate the installation by jumping, crawling, climbing, and pressing switches.  The player also possesses an electronic defuser, which can damage or disable robots, but has no effect on living creatures such as the biological weapons.  While exploring, the player may discover storage compartments containing items for use in battles.  There are also many enemies strolling around the complex which the player will often stumble into.  If the player is spotted by one of these creatures, it will begin to hustle towards the player to engage in combat.  If the player is able to get behind an enemy without being spotted, the player can gain a significant advantage in the ensuing combat.  Either way, once the player comes into close proximity with an enemy, the game shifts into combat mode with very different gameplay and controls.  </div>  <div> Combat  : When the player engages an enemy in combat, the gameplay becomes similar to a 3D fighting game with RPG elements.  The player may move around the room in two dimensions and execute hand-to-hand attacks against the enemy, while blocking or avoiding the enemy's retaliation.  However, unlike most fighting games, when one combatant wishes to attack, the action is paused while the combatant chooses which body part to attack with (R/L leg, R/L arm, torso, head) and which attack to execute.  The opponent is then notified of an incoming attack and must choose how to defend (dodge, block, counter).  The type of attack and the attacker's skill level versus the defender's chosen defense and skill level will determine the attack's success.  The frequency of attacks is limited by each combatant's power bar, which slowly fills until it reaches full strength.  If a combatant attacks before it is completely full, his attacks will less powerful, proportional to the bar's state.  Eventually, the player will gain the ability to let his power bar fill to multiple stages, essentially storing power for multiple attacks, which can be unleashed in the form of combos - the player can create strings of attacks which are very difficult to defend against if properly executed.  In this style, the game focuses on strategy and tactics rather than  speed and reflexes.   </div>  <div> Attacks and Defenses : There are essentially three different subgroups of attacks: punches, kicks, and wrestling moves called ""techniques"".  </div>  <div> RPG Elements  : A punch is made up of three components: the arm attacked with, the height of the attack, and the type of punch thrown.  For example, the ""right mid hook"" is a punch that attacks an enemy's midsection with the right hand in a sweeping motion from the side.  It is likely to strike the opponent's torso or left arm.  On the other hand, a ""left upper punch"" will throw a straight punch with the left hand, targeted at the opponent's head.  Punches are useful in close quarters and can stun an enemy if it receives enough blows to the head. </div> "

The game's eight starting characters are all anthropomorphic balls that have to use their abilities to climb to the top of each of the game's towers first. While all the characters were the same in terms of their abilities, the game box boasts that all eight characters had different personalities; however, these seemed to have no impact in the gameplay.As well as the normal mode, which involved racing against three other computer or player controlled opponents. The game had other modes as well, such as time trial and battle mode. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each level in the game was called a 'tower', due to the generally vertical nature of the levels. Traversing each tower is mainly undertaken via the use of a grapple hook - often the character's tongue. The grapple ability is primarily used to hook onto platforms - either to progress upwards or to avoid projectiles. The grapple can also be used to hook onto other players in order to stun them momentarily or to throw them off the course.As well the the grapple, players are able to flap for a short distance to bridge gaps, and initiate 'turbo mode' to roll at great speeds. </div> "

Unfortunately though, the machine is broken up into many pieces. Fortunately however, he stumbles upon a tablet that points to the locations of the various pieces.

To begin with, Indy is constantly exploring throughout the game. He runs through canyons, fields, and valleys (among other places). During this exploration, he is jumping across chasms, exploring hidden passages, and fighting wild beasts. The fighting system can also be compared to that of the Tomb Raider franchise; players ""lock on"" to one enemy and then circle around, dodging attacks and returning attacking with a gun, a whip, or fists. Furthermore, there are numerous collectibles hidden in various places which Indy must climb, swim, crawl, and swing to get to. Some items are required finds, while others are bonuses that unlock various special features. </div>  <div> Nintendo 64 Version : From March 1999 to October 2000 a team of eight Factor 5 employees ported the PC version of the game onto Nintendo 64.

The platforming allows for a shift away from linear level progression towards one that encouraged exploration in a manner similar to other Rare produced games, such as Banjo Kazooie. Like Banjo Kazooie, and many platformers of the time, the game contains a huge number of collectible items. Reviewers considered this one of the game's weak points. In addition to an extensive single player campaign, Jet Force Gemini also offered split-screen mulitplayer modes. </div>  <div> Storyline : Juno attacks an enemy.The game starts with Gemini squadron (Juno, Vela and their trusty dog Lupus) in orbit of the planet Goldwood when they witness an attack upon the the planets native population, a bear like race called tribals. The attackers are the drones of space tyrant Mizar, who sees Goldwood as a valuable resource and the tribals as slaves and easily dispatched if need be. Frustrated at the inaction of their government who believe that Mizar is not a threat the Gemini squadron head towards the planet, splitting off into separate paths. Upon landing Juno is greeted by King Jeff, the leader of the tribals who shows him that Mizar is systematically invading planets and seems to have almost an infinite army. It soon becomes apparent that Mizar wants more than Goldwood's surrounding planets but wants to control the entire universe including the destruction of Earth. With the federation ignoring the threat only the Gemini squadron are left to save Earth. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Juno with Floyd. Floyd is controlled by the second player in Co-Op games. A Tribal is visible on the doorway in the background.Unlike many shooters, Jet Force Gemini featured a structure similar to 3D platformers of the time. Levels were non-linear, with a focus on exploration and the collection of items to aid the player or allow for further progression. Many levels feature situations where players can take different paths to reach objectives. Later in the game, players are able to visit each planet with any of the available characters. Because the three playable characters posses different abilities, each can access areas inaccessible to the other two. The game's main collectible item is the Tribal, a small Ewok-like creature. Tribals are hidden throughout the levels, and to fully complete the game and defeat Mizar a player must collect them all. This task is impossible during a player's first run through the game, as several Tribals in the earlier levels are unreachable without items gathered later in the game. Additionally, Tribals can be killed either by the the player or enemies. If a specific Tribal is killed, it cannot be collected, and the player will have to replay the level to save it. </div>  <div> Multiplayer Modes : The single player campaign could be played cooperatively once the player rescues Floyd. From that point on another player can control Floyd's gun turrets but not his movements. </div>  <div> Development : The standard deathmatch option of Jet Force Gemini. While the matches could not be customised as heavily as game like Goldeneye, it did allow a few weapon choices and game scoring modes based on time, number of kills or number of lives. </div>  <div> Reception : This mode is essentially an on rails shooter where the players controlled a cross hair and were taken through a set path on a course where they had to shoot at targets of drones and avoid targets of tribals. </div>  <div> Rerelease : A simple arcade type racing game that is unlocked as a multiplayer option once the mini-game has been completed in the single player campaign. </div> "

With a port already released the team decided to work on a port of Killer Instinct 2 for the N64 instead.Killer Instinct 2 and Killer Instinct Gold may share the same story. Unlike the arcade version of Killer Instinct 2, Killer Instinct Gold did not have any FMV due to the lack of space on the N64 cartridge.

Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards,HAL Laboratory,Nintendo,26-Jun-00,n64,Kirby's sole Nintendo 64 adventure has him travel throughout the galaxy (with his friends) to gather shards of a magical Crystal. The game is notable for Kirby's ability to combine two different abilities for crazy results.,3030-17093,17093,0,3/24/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/kirby-64-the-crystal-shards/3030-17093/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards (known in Japan as Kirby of the Stars 64) is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 on March 24, 2000 (in Japan), June 26, 2000 (in North America), and June 22, 2001 (in Europe).The sixth main installment of the Kirby series (starring the pink puffball of the same name), The Crystal Shards expands on the previous platformers by introducing 3D graphics (still in a 2D movement plane) and the ability to merge two abilities together into a single powerful ability (giving him 35 total abilities). While Kirby does not have any animal friends or multiplayer ""Helpers"" from some of his previous games, he can enlist Waddle Dee, and Adeleine, and King Dedede for help at certain points in the game. The game also includes some some competitive multiplayer mini-games (for up to four players, with each player as either Kirby, Waddle Dee, Adeleine, or King Dedede).The game's story involves the Crystal, a sacred treasure of Ripple Star (a planet populated by fairies). When the planet is invaded by Dark Matter, one of the fairies (Ribbon) escapes with the Crystal only to crash land onto Pop Star (with the Crystal shattered into many pieces throughout the galaxy). It's up to Kirby and his friends to gather all the Crystal Shards throughout six different planets and cleanse Ripple Star of Dark Matter.The Crystal Shards was digitally re-released (via Virtual Console) for both the Wii (on February 25, 2008) and the Wii U (on July 30, 2015). The Wii version was also used in the Kirby's Dream Collection compilation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series. </div>  <div> Abilities : While there are seven core abilities in the game, Kirby can merge two abilities into one combination ability (by either inhaling both ability enemies at the same time, by spitting an ability enemy onto another, or by transferring his ability into an Ability Star and throwing it an ability enemy to create a combination Ability Star). There are twenty-eight combination abilities in the game. </div> "

The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask,Nintendo EAD,Nintendo,26-Oct-00,n64,"The follow-up to Ocarina of Time sees the series stalwart Link embark on a journey to save the land of Termina from being crushed by the moon in three days. To defeat the Skull Kid, Link has to live the same three days over and over again.",3030-13594,13594,0,4/27/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask/3030-13594/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Released on October 26, 2000, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is the follow-up to previous Nintendo 64 favorite The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Majora's Mask features several technological upgrades over its predecessor, as well as new game mechanics, such as a time travel element which can be used to influence events in the game's non-linear structure. The game was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo.Critical reception was almost unanimous in favor of the game, with many critics praising the game's darker story, the time travel element, its non-linearity, and the evolution of Ocarina of Time's gameplay systems. Fan reception was more mixed, as is typical with a major Zelda release, with some fans complaining about the game's departure from the norm, as well as the reduced accessibility. In 2010, Majora's Mask was voted as ""Game of the Decade"" by users of GameFAQs. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Link ""Z targets"" an enemy.The actual mechanics of controlling Link are identical to the mechanics in Ocarina of Time. Link moves with the analog stick, can lock on to enemies with the Z button, and equip three items to the three C buttons. The core sword-fighting handles exactly the same as it was in Ocarina of Time, as is playing the Ocarina and using items. However, unlike the previous installment, there is a much greater emphasis on time management, since Link is constantly on the clock. The game starts Link at 6:00 AM on the First Day (which can be observed on the new Clock icon at the bottom of the screen, displaying the time and the date) and the Moon will destroy Termina at 6:00 AM on the Third Day.Since the seventy-two game hours last approximately fifty-four minutes of real time, it seemed, at the outset, that the game had provided Link with an impossible task. However, upon completing the game's tutorial level (in which Deku Link is confined to the city, allowing the player to see how the seventy-two hour cycle affected the game world) Link reclaims the Ocarina of Time. Playing the Song of Time on the Ocarina (identical to the version in Ocarina of Time) would warp Link back to the beginning of the First Day, starting again at 6:00 AM. By traveling back to the beginning of the First Day, the player has, effectively, an infinite amount of time to do everything needed in order to complete the game.By playing the Song of Time, Link can return to the dawn of his first day in Termina.More importantly, the passage of time can be slowed down significantly by playing the Inverted Song of Time, the notes of the Song of Time backwards. While this slows down the in-game passage of time, it does not slow down Link's perception of time, giving the player just over two and a half hours to complete tasks in a given cycle.To create a game that utilizes the player's need to travel back in time every two and a half hours, the entire game is designed around ""scheduled events."" Similar to the system used in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, every single character in the game world operates on their own ""schedule."" Non-player characters (NPCs) will appear in certain places only at certain times, and certain events can only be witnessed at certain times and at specific places. Link can learn the schedules of the various in-game characters by investigating them and (automatically) recording the information in his journal. The Journal can then be used to help Link meet up at specific locations to complete side missions, unlock the path to the next dungeon, or complete a dungeon altogether. Link can use this journal to be at the right place at the right time, allowing him to solve the puzzles necessary to move foreword, and complete NPC quests in order to earn items key to progressing in the game.When the end of the Third Day draws near, Link can then warp back to the beginning of the First Day and continue on his journey through the same three days again. However, warping back to the start of the first day means that everything in the world moves back to the first day. All the puzzles solved to go to new areas are now again unsolved. The NPCs won't remember that Link solved their problems, because he hasn't done it yet. All the quests Link completed are no longer completed. Furthermore, once Link goes back in time, he loses all of the weapon ammunition he has collected (such as arrows and deku nuts) as well as all of the Rupees carried in his wallet and the small/ Big keys he obtained from the game's dungeons. Link will not, however, lose any masks, songs, sword upgrades, Rupees stored in the bank, or items obtained over the past three days.This design setup, initially, seems maddening, but the game provides a few ways to mitigate the headache of repeating the same sections over and over again over seventy-two hours. First, Majora's Mask effectively splits game progression into three parts. To move forward in the game, the player must first go to the unique zone where the next objective is located. Next, the player has to find the entrance to the dungeon in the zone. Finally, the player has to complete the dungeon. Each of these steps can be completed in two-and-a-half hours and completing each of these steps rewards Link with a way to avoid repeating the puzzles/dungeon/traveling over and over again.Heart Containers are one of several items which are spared the negative effects of time travel.Completing the first two steps (going to the new area or finding the entrance to the dungeon) will usually put Link close to a warp point (in the form of an owl statue). By playing the Song of Soaring, Link can warp to any of these statues once having discovered them. Because songs and warp points don't disappear when Link travels back in time, the player can often times find the warp point, go back the beginning of the First Day, warp to the newly discovered point, and continue the game from there. This keeps the game’s time limit from being too unmanageable, as it simply encourages the player to play the game in chunks, completing one section, going back in time and moving onto the next section.Defeating a dungeon's main boss will free one of four giants, protectors of Termina who are Clock Town's only hope in stopping the Moon. They must be summoned at the right moment by playing the Oath to Order, which Link learns after defeating the first boss. Thus, all the player has to do is complete each of the game's four dungeons to summon the giants to hold up the moon and stop Skull Kid, the game's primary antagonist. </div>  <div> Plot : The Skull Kid wearing Majora's Mask, the antagonist of the game.Shortly after defeating Ganondorf and saving Hyrule in Ocarina of Time, Link sets off on a new journey to reunite himself with ""a lost friend,"" implied to be Navi the Fairy. With Epona and the Ocarina of Time, Link travels to a mysterious forest when he encounters the Skull Kid. Armed with the great power of Majora's Mask, the Skull Kid steals the Ocarina of Time, scares Epona away, and magically turns Link into a Deku Scrub. As Deku Link gives chase to Skull Kid, he inexplicably finds himself inside a mysterious clock tower. Inside, Link is greeted by the Happy Mask Salesman from Ocarina of Time, from whom the Skull Kid stole Majora's Mask, claiming that it holds a terrible power. The Happy Mask Salesman tasks Link with recovering the mask within seventy-two hours, before, the Happy Mask Salesman claims, he must leave the town. </div>  <div> Masks : The central area is the bustling locale of Clock Town, in the land of Termina (a parallel world to Link's Hyrule). After stepping outside the Clock Tower, the Moon can be seen menacingly in the sky above. Using the power of the dark mask, Skull Kid has turned the Moon into a terrible monster which will crash into Termina in seventy-two hours, precisely three days from the moment Link exits the clock tower.After the first cycle of three days, Link gets the Ocarina of Time back from the Skull Kid. He remembers the Song of Time and plays it as soon as he picks it up. This magically resets the three day cycle, when he first met the Happy Mask Salesman. Link and the Salesman seem to be the only ones who remember everything that happened in those three days. The Happy Mask Salesman sees the instrument in Link's hands and teaches him the Song of Healing, which returns him to his original form, transforming the curse into a Deku Mask that will allow him to become a Deku Scrub at will. In return, the Happy Mask Salesman once again asks that Link retrieve Majora's Mask. To do so, he must venture into the four regions surrounding Clock Town and acquire the masks worn by four evil monsters. Only then can he face the Skull Kid and retrieve the mask. Now, Link has to once again take up the sword, recover Epona, and find a way to defeat Skull Kid and stop him from destroying Termina. </div>  <div> Graphics : Link's Deku Scrub transformation form.Over the course of Majora's Mask, Link will acquire a variety of masks that can confer various abilities. After completing the initial tutorial section, Deku Link learns the Song of Healing, which turns Link back to his human form, while containing the Deku form into a Deku Mask. Wearing the Mask at any time (which can be equipped to the C buttons) will turn Link back into the Deku scrub, while taking it off returns Link to Human form. Along with the Deku Mask, Link can find a Goron Mask (turning Link into a Goron) and a Zora Mask (turning Link into a Zora). These transformation masks are the more important of the game's 24 masks, as the game requires Link to switch between the various forms (Human Link, Deku Link, Goron Link, and Zora Link) to complete puzzles and defeat Bosses. Each of the forms has specific abilities that the player can use to solve these puzzles.Link's Goron transformation form.Human Link is the most versatile of the 4 forms, and can use all of the items in the game that he finds during his travels (like the bow and hookshot, etc.). Human Link can pull himself onto ledges, grab onto heights, and has the greatest maneuverability in combat. Deku Link is too short to grab ledges, and cannot swim in water (the form can hop across Water, but after five hops, Link falls into the water and drowns). Deku Link can use magic to fire a magical spitball at opponents to stun them, as well as to pop balloons in the air. Deku Link can also launch out of flower pads, and use large petals as propellers to float to a new location (giving Link a float after his jump for more Air Control. Goron Link is extremely heavy, very slow in normal combat, has a hard time pulling himself up ledges, and is damaged greatly by Water. The Goron Mask lets Link, however, curl into a ball and roll at opponents, even growing spikes to damage enemies and break boulders (much like Sonic the Hedgehog). Zora Link can breathe underwater and swim much faster than Human Link. He can also use his fins as boomerangs (much like the Boomerang in Ocarina of Time), but the form has no melee attacks.Link's Zora transformation form.While only Link can use the various weapons in the game, all four forms can use the Ocarina of Time and play songs to solve puzzles. Each form creates a different instrument when the Ocarina is selected; Deku Link pulls out a large Organ and keyboard, Goron Link grabs a huge set of bongo drums, and Zora Link uses a marlin skeleton as a Guitar. In addition to these three masks, there are 21 other masks spread throughout the game. While many of the masks can be collected simply through normal game progression, many of the masks can only be earned by completing a certain NPC's quest (usually tied to that NPC's schedule, requiring Link to do something specific at a certain time). To collect the Fierce Deity Mask (the 24th and final Mask, which greatly increases Link's power and defense), the player will have to complete every sub quest in the game, which means collecting the other 23 masks. Like the weapons, songs and warp points, Masks aren’t lost when Link travels to the beginning of the ""First Day."" </div>  <div> Majora's Mask 3D : All Night MaskAll Night MaskThis mask has one use only: to listen to Anju's Grandmother's stories, which normally make Link fall asleep.Listen to the first story (Carnival of Time) and choose all the top answers to receive a Piece of a Heart.Listen to the second story (Four Giants) and choose ""I dunno"" to receive another Piece of a Heart.To get it, on the First Night at 12:00 AM, Link has to stop Sakon the Thief from stealing the Bomb Bags from the Old Lady, or else those will be at the Curiosity Shop later.Then, on the Final Night at 10:00 PM, Link can buy the All-Night Mask at the Curiosity Shop for 500 Rupees.Bomb MaskBomb MaskWear this mask and press B to explode.

Link's sword is now two handed and does a significant amount more damage. Also, while Z targeting, he can shoot beams at his enemies. The catch is that it can only be used in Boss rooms.In the Japanese Version, people call him Oni Link. Oni is a Japanese word roughly meaning ""ogre demon"". In English, this doesn't make too much sense and is considered ""evil"" to call someone a demon, but it's really just to insinuate power.

Play the Song of Healing to put the spirit of Mikau the guitarist into a mask. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Majora's Mask was created using an updated, more robust version of the Ocarina of Time engine. Part of the game's superior visual fidelity is due to the game's required use of the Nintendo 64 ""Expansion Pak."" The expanded RAM capacity of the pak (8 MB instead of the initial 4MB inside the N64) allowed for more detailed character models than seen in Ocarina of Time, as well as higher resolution textures and less ""fog"" obscuring objects in the distance (meaning a longer draw distance). The pak also provided slight improvements to the game's frame rate, as well as superior lighting effects.Dance the time away!While the game looks better than its predecessor, Majora's Mask still retains the art design seen in Ocarina of Time. While many of the game's textures, locations, and effects are new, character models were lifted straight out of Ocarina of Time and only slightly changed for the new game. For instance, the Twinrova witches (the boss fight from Ocarina of Time's spirit temple) were potion sellers in Majora's Mask, and the Kakariko/Hyrule Castle soldiers now patrol the streets of Clock Town. Some of the character models aren't altered in the slightest from Ocarina of Time, but most of them have been upgraded. For example, Link looks distinctly different from the appearance of ""Young Link"" in Ocarina of Time. </div> "
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Nintendo EAD,Nintendo,23-Nov-98,n64,"The first 3D Legend of Zelda game, Ocarina of Time was created for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 and introduced innovative mechanics such as Z-targeting as well as many of the series' other trademarks. It has frequently been ranked as the greatest game of all time by many publications.",3030-12572,12572,0,11/21/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released in Japan on November 21, 1998, and in North America two days later. It was the first Zelda game to be produced in 3D, and creator Shigeru Miyamoto was almost universally praised for smoothly transitioning Zelda into the 3D space and preserving the feel of the franchise. Ocarina of Time is the fifth game in the series and was developed by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis and Development division for the Nintendo 64.The Legend of Zelda series' first appearance on the Nintendo 64 brought many of the franchise's mainstays along with it. There are dungeons with forest, fire, and water themes, for instance, and trademark weapons and items like the bomb and boomerang are also available. Because it was the first 3D game in the series, many innovations made their first appearance in the game play. This is the first game to feature a lock-on targeting system whereby Link can circle around and direct his attacks at the targeted enemy. The so-called ""Z-targeting"" system was subsequently adopted by numerous third-person action games. </div>  <div> Story : The Great Deku Tree.In the vast, deep forest of Hyrule, the Great Deku Tree served as the guardian spirit. The children of the forest, the Kokiri, lived with the Great Deku Tree. Each Kokiri had his or her own guardian fairy, except one. His name was Link.This is where the game begins, with the player as Link, a simple young boy living with the Kokiri tribe who are elf-like children that never grow up and can never leave the Kokiri Forest. After having an inexplicable dream, the game's hero, Link, is awakened by a guardian fairy named Navi. She explains that the Great Deku Tree has summoned him and there is no time to waste. After searching the town for the Kokiri Sword, and finding enough rupees to buy the Deku Shield, Link is allowed to enter the presence of the Great Deku Tree. Link finds out that he has been summoned to attempt to save the Deku Tree from death after being cursed by an evil man. After defeating the curse, but failing to save the Great Deku Tree, Link is told the origin of the world of Hyrule…..""A long time ago . . .Before life began, before the world had formed, three golden goddesses descended upon the chaotic land of Hyrule.They were Din, the goddess of power, Nayru, the goddess of wisdom and Farore, the goddess of courage.Din, with her strong flaming arms, cultivated the land to create the earth.Nayru poured her wisdom onto the earth to give the spirit of law to the world.Farore's rich soul created all life forms who would uphold the law.These great goddesses returned to the heavens, leaving behind the golden sacred Triforce.Since then, the Triforce has become the basis for Hyrule's providence.Where the Triforce Stood became sacred land.""The Triforce - A sacred object left by the gods in Hyrule.The Deku Tree then reveals that the “wicked man from the desert” that cursed him was searching for one of three sacred stones, the keys to opening the door of time located in Temple of Time and gaining access to the Triforce. After giving Link the spiritual stone of the forest, the Kokiri's Emerald, the Deku Tree tells Link that he is different from all the other Kokiri and has a destiny that lies beyond the forest. Before he dies he sends Link to search out the other two spiritual stones, and specifically to the Hyrule Castle. As the story unfolds it is learned that Link needs to stop the “wicked man from the desert”, named Ganondorf, from gaining access to all three pieces of the Triforce and gaining the full power of the Goddesses.Just as Link leaves Kokiri Forest, his old friend Saria gives him the Fairy Ocarina. A musical device capable of playing numerous melodies. As he steps onto Hyrule Field, he meets a wise owl, Kaepora Gaebora, who gives advice to Link on his quest. Link makes his way across the Hyrule Field and eventually arrives at Hyrule Castle. He storms through the market and reaches the castle gate. It is here that he meets Malon, a dairy maid and daughter of the owner of Lon Lon Ranch, who she gives him an egg after stating that her dad is missing after doing a milk delivery. Being refused entry to the castle, Link climbs up some vines around the side of the gate and sneaks past all the guards to get into the castle. The only way in being a small trapdoor on the side of the building. However, this is blocked by a sleeping Talon, the missing owner of Lon Lon Ranch. Not being awoken by normal methods, Link waits a night and a day and the egg hatches into a Cuckoo. The Cuckoo wakes up Talon, who runs back home after he realizes that Malon is upset. Link now sneaks into the castle via the small trapdoor.As he goes into the Castle, there are more guards patrolling the grounds. Link successfully sneaks past them and is greeted by Princess Zelda. She tells the story of how Hyrule was created and how Ganondorf, the Gerudo King, is trying to harness the power of the Triforce for himself. After agreeing to help the Princess, Link meets Impa, nurse of Zelda, who teaches him Zelda's lullaby and escorts him out of the castle, but not before giving him a note to allow him to climb Death Mountain.Once back in Hyrule Field, Link goes back to Kokiri Forest to get Saria's Song, as it is one of the Goron's favorite songs. However, Saria is nowhere to be seen, so Link searches for her and ends up in the Lost Woods, an eerie forest which seems to be an endless maze. After Link makes his way through the Lost Woods, with the help of Kaepora Gaebora, he eventually finds Saria sitting on a tree stump. It is here Link learns Saria's Song, this allows him to ask for Saria's advice whenever he needs it wherever he may be. Link makes his way to Death Mountain, and his second Spiritual Stone.Making his way back through Hyrule Field, Link heads for Kakariko Village, at the base of Death Mountain. Once here, he shows the guard guarding the entrance to Death Mountain, the letter that Impa gave him and Link is granted permission to make his way up the dangerous mountain. Avoiding various Tektites and other dangers, Link finally arrives at Goron City. Encountering a locked door, Link plays Zelda's Lullaby and meets Darunia, who refuses to talk to him as he is a bad mood. To brighten the atmosphere, Saria's Song is played and Darunia breaks into dance. Finally being in a good mood again, Darunia gives link the Power Bracelet, which allows him to pick up Bomb Flowers. Using this new found strength, Link picks up a Bomb Flower and blows up the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern.Link makes his way through Dodongo's Cavern, fighting various enemies such as Keese, Lizalfos and Dodongos. He obtains the dungeon's treasure which are bombs. This allows him to carry bombs with him instead of depending on Bomb Flowers and the Goron Bracelet. Link makes his way through the dungeon and eventually reaches King Dodongo. After defeating King Dodongo and ridding Dodongo's Cavern of any threats, Darunia congratulates Link making him a 'brother' and gives him the second spiritual stone, the Goron's Ruby.With two out of the three spiritual stones obtained, only the Zora's Sapphire remains. Link makes his way to the Zora domain, gaining entrance by playing Zelda's Lullaby. He speaks to the king of the Zoras who tells him that his daughter, Princess Ruto is missing and asks Link to go find her. Link can then take part in a diving game which if he completes, it will give him the silver scale. Using his new found ability to breathe underwater for longer, Link uses the secret entrance to Lake Hylia found in Zora's domain. It is here that he finds a message in a bottle. The message states that Princess Ruto has gone to see Jabu Jabu. Link shows the king this message and the king allows him to pass. Jabu Jabu has been acting strangely recently and when Link feeds him a fish, Jabu Jabu engulfs Link.When inside Jabu Jabu, Link finds Princess Ruto, who is rather rude. Link has to escort her around the body while avoiding the enemies that plague the area. As Link reaches the end of the dungeon, he fights the dungeon boss using his new found boomerang. Once defeated, Princess Ruto is saved and she gives him the Zora's Sapphire as an engagement present stating that she will get married to Link in the future.Now that Link has all three spiritual stones he makes his way back towards Hyrule Castle. As he reaches the gates of the market place, he sees Zelda and Impa ride out on horseback, Zelda notices Link and throws the Ocarina of Time back into the moat surrounding the castle. Just after they disappear, Ganondorf comes storming through the gates and asks Link where the princess went. He refuses to answer and then is hit by Ganondorf's thunderball.When Link awakens, he jumps into the moat and finds the Ocarina of Time and proceeds to the Temple of Time. He opens the Door of Time by placing all three spiritual stones on the alter, this reveals the Master Sword resting in the Pedestal of Time. After Link unsheathes the Master Sword from the Pedestal of Time he unknowingly and unwillingly gives Ganondorf access to the Sacred Realm.Map of Hyrule, from The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of TimeOcarina of Time takes place in two different time settings with players controlling both young Link and adult Link. The game starts when Link is a young boy trying to stop Ganondorf from gaining the Triforce. Upon gaining access to the Temple of Time and the Master Sword, Link travels seven years into the future. Link learns that the time travel happens because, although Link is the chosen one to remove the Master Sword from its stone sealed sheath, he must be of a certain age to wield it. Therefore Link is trapped in a sort of “hibernation” until he is old enough to fulfill his destiny. When Link awakens he finds that in his absence, Ganondorf has used the Triforce of Power to take control of Hyrule and turn it into a post-apocalyptic world. Link must now embark on a quest to save the once beautiful land of Hyrule. </div>  <div> Control Scheme : In a situation similar to the development of Super Mario 64 (released in 1996), Nintendo faced the difficult task of translating one of gaming's most beloved franchises into 3D, which meant a complete overhaul of the series' classic design mechanics.Only the Great King of Evil can stand up to the power of Z-Targeting with his aura of evil.Unlike the previous, top-down 2D Zelda games, Ocarina of Time utilized a completely 3D view. The player could control both Link's direction and the velocity of movement via the Analog Stick. The camera in Ocarina of Time floated around Link (as opposed to the greater camera controls in Super Mario 64), and could be instantly directed behind Link by pressing the Z button. Although the B button permanently controlled use of the sword, the games various other items (such as the Bow and the Hookshot) could be mapped onto the Left, Right, and Down C-Buttons, allowing Link to access more of his weaponry without pulling up a menu.Nintendo brought two major control innovations to bear in Ocarina of Time. The first, and most obvious, new control feature was Lock-On Targeting (referred to as Z-Targeting in the game). Pressing the Z button when Link was near a person, enemy, sign or interactive part of the environment caused the camera to lock onto the target (in game, Link's fairy, Navi, would fly to the nearby target and Link would turn his eyes directly towards Navi's new location). From the locked on position, Link could strafe around his target, use rolls and flips to dodge enemy attacks, and easily interact/talk to NPCs in three dimensional space.The idea of locking on to a target was revolutionary: game programmers and designers, who were trying to understand how characters would be able to physically interact in 3D, couldn’t understand how to make a game with the same type of tight control they could achieve in a 2D perspective. Characters could never line up properly with their targets and movement speed was too slow. Many games had control schemes that confused players. In Ocarina of Time however, players could instantly face and run directly to characters, would always be facing toward an enemy, and had more control over Link.The second key innovation of Ocarina of Time was the creation of the context-sensitive buttons. Rather than map every single one of Link's abilities to a different button on the N64 controller, or only provide Link with a handful of abilities, Nintendo mapped many ""secondary"" control features to the A button. When in a certain situation or ""context"" (in front of a door, near a block, in combat, playing the Ocarina, riding Epona), the on-screen A button would display a word, indicating what the button could currently be used for (e.g. opening doors, pushing blocks, jump attacks in combat, putting the Ocarina away, speeding Epona up). This was a more subtle change to the series, but Context-Sensitive buttons became the industry standard way for developers to assign controller buttons, using permanent assignment only for important actions, while letting a player use ""secondary functions"" only in the proper context. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The A button is used to scrolls through text, roll, read signs, and dodge enemy attacks.Perhaps the biggest surprise for players who purchased the game was that, despite the new perspective, brand new controls, and 3D graphics, Ocarina of Time was still a full-blooded Zelda game. Sticking to its roots, the game led players through nine different dungeons, having them complete tricky puzzles and defeat big bosses along the way.Ocarina of Time, like the Zelda games that came before it, is primarily an exploration and puzzle solving game, with sword combat, horseback riding, and boss fights playing providing a change of pace. The player progresses through the game by guiding Link to one of the nine dungeons and collecting a mystical artifact at the end (three jewels in the first half of the game, six medallions in the second half). Each of these dungeons is filled with puzzles that hinder Link's progress, and the player must solve them to continue their quest. In every dungeon (after the first one) players will encounter a ""Sub-Boss"", a powerful enemy that the player will be forced to do battle with. Defeating the Sub-Boss will lead the player to an item that will be necessary to solve puzzles farther in the dungeon. At the very end, players will encounter the Boss of the dungeon, who can only be defeated with tactical use of the new weapon retrieved in the dungeon (and some well placed sword slashes).Players will still guide Link through dungeons, collect keys, and fight Ganon -- only this time in 3DPuzzles in the dungeons often share very basic similarities (there's quite a bit of time spent pushing blocks, standing on switches, and pushes blocks onto switches). However, each dungeon has a ""theme"" that changes the way the player moves through the dungeon. The Water Temple, for example, can only be beaten if the player raises and lowers the water levels, which they can only do at specific parts of the dungeon. The Shadow Dungeon, on the other hand, is filled with invisible walls and traps, not to mention mirages. The player can only see through these disguises with the Lens of Truth. </div>  <div> Main Characters : Ocarina of Time boasted a cast of dozens of characters, including both series stalwarts (like Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon) while also introducing new denizens of the land of Hyrule that would go on to be featured in later installments of the series. </div>  <div> Songs : Young LinkThe main character of Ocarina of Time, and the protagonist of nearly all the Legend of Zelda games (with rare exception). Like previous Zelda games, the player may choose any name they want for the main character(including their own), but the default character name is Link. The name Link, according to Shigeru Miyamoto, comes from a literal interpretation of what the main character is in a video game: a link between the player and the game.The Link featured in Ocarina of Time is not a continuation of his adventures from the NES, Game Boy, and Super Nintendo games, but a whole new Link in a whole new story unrelated to those previous games. Ocarina of Time helped to cement the fact that the Legend of Zelda games were not a series of stories connected together in a linear timeline, but rather a retelling of the same story: different plot details, character interactions, and action sequences may occur, but the core theme(boy saves princess/world) remains the same throughout many of the main story.The player will eventually control two different ""versions"" of Link: first as a boy, and then later as a young adult, after he travels forward in time 7 years. This older incarnation of Link is widely regarded as the most popular representation of the series' protagonist, and fan clamor for a game starring the older, more ""mature"" Link was so strong that Nintendo obliged with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess in 2006 for both the GameCube and Wii, which were designed around the mature Link aesthetic.Link begins Ocarina of Time as a small boy, a native of the Kokiri tribe designated as protectors of the forests of Hyrule. Link is still a child in the eyes of his peers; he's the one member of the tribe that has not been granted a fairy, a companion sprite to help him out in the world (hence his early-game nickname, ""The Boy without a Fairy). At the outset of the game, Link is trouble by strange dreams, visions of a man dressed in black from the west whose presence seems to be a threat (effectively predicting the invasion of Hyrule by Ganondorf and the Gerudo Tribe).Adult LinkAs Link is awakened from his slumber, he meets Navi, the fairy and companion throughout the game. Link has been tasked by the Guardian of the Great Deku Tree, to remove a dark curse planted inside it by the Court Adviser and dark Wizard Ganondorf (the Gerudo man seen in Link's dreams). Despite Link's triumph over the monster deep inside the Tree's Roots, Link was too late to save the Great Deku Tree, as the curse had already taken its toll. With it's last wish, the Great Deku Tree gave Link a quest: he must leave the forest and travel across the world to Hyrule, and present a mysterious green stone, the Kokiri Emerald, to Princess Zelda, implying that she would know how to stop Ganondorf from taking over Hyrule.Link's journey will take him to the Princess Zelda, and together the two would hatch a plan to defeat Ganondorf by acquiring the Triforce, the mystical relics that helped to preserve the land and make it flourish after the goddesses created Hyrule. The Triforce was also the object of Ganondorf's desires, as the mystical triangles were able to grant any wish the holder of the relic desired. Link and Zelda decided to get to the Triforce before Ganondorf by getting to the Triforce first. To access the Sacred Realm (where the Triforce has been stored by the gods), Link must locate two more sacred stones, the Goron's Ruby and the Zora's Sapphire. Together with the Kokiri Emerald, Link and Zelda are able to open the Door of Time. When Link draws the fabled Master Sword from its pedestal from behind the door of time, he opened the Sacred Realm and access the Triforce. However, Ganon managed to get the Triforce before Link and Zelda, and with his first wish, the dark wizard declared himself the new ruler of Hyrule.When Link returns to consciousness, he finds himself inside the fabled Chamber of Sages. Inside, he is given his next task by Rauru, the Sage of Light. In order to combat Ganon and deliver Hyrule from evil, Link must awaken the other 5 sages, denizens of Hyrule that must take on the mantle of protectors of the Triforce and Hyrule. Only Link, the legendary Hero of Time (with the power to travel between the past and future) can defeat Ganondorf's evil forces. With the power of the awakened Sages, Link would be able to seal Ganondorf away inside the Sacred Realm for all time.Upon obtaining all 6 of the Sage Medallions (designators that the sage has been awakened), Link learns that Ganondorf only managed to grab one piece of the three pronged Triforce. Ganondorf possessed the Triforce of Power, while Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Courage would help give Link the strength to rescue the Princess Zelda and defeat Ganondorf once and for all. </div>  <div> Key Equipment : Princess Zelda (Adult)The titular character of the Legend of Zelda series, Princess Zelda is a member of Hyrule's royal family. The young princess is the only member of her family that suspects Ganondorf's treachery, fearing that his true interests are to take control of the Triforce (which the Royal Family is sworn to protect).Link first meets Princess Zelda at the behest of the Great Deku Tree. His task was to take the Kokiri Emerald to the Princess. After sneaking his way into the castle and avoiding guards in the Castle Royal Gardens, Link finally makes his way into Zelda's room and private garden. At first, Zelda was surprised that the young boy had managed to sneak past the guards, but when she discovers that Link had arrived in the Castle from the forest, and had a fairy companion, Zelda remembered the dream she had of the boy emerging from the forest with a fairy, and was convinced that Link was the one destined to help her keep the Triforce away from Ganondorf. Zelda tells Link of her fears about the dark wizard, and together, the two children hatch a plan to protect the Triforce from Ganondorf's evil.To open the Door of Time and Access the Sacred Realm, the pair would need to play the Song of Time on Zelda's greatest treasure, the Ocarina of Time, passed down throughout the Royal Family.However, before Link and Zelda use the Sacred Stones to open the Door of Time, Ganondorf begins his coup in Hyrule Castle and chases the Princess and her guardian Impa from the Castle. As they cross the gate to Hyrule Castle Town, Zelda throws the Ocarina of Time into the moat for Link to recover, imbued with a secret message from the princess that teaches Link how to play the Song of Time. The young Princess Zelda won't be seen again until the player has completed the game.When Link awakens in the Temple of Time seven years in the future, he is greeted by the mysterious Sheik, the last surviving member of the Sheikah, a tribe dedicated to the protection of the royal family. Sheik describes to Link the new world, one controlled and maintained by Ganondorf from the safety of Hyrule Castle. Sheik points Link towards the first Sage, the Sage of the Forest, and gives Link hints about the tools he will need to help save and awaken the various Sages. Sheik will eventually teach Link special ""warp"" songs that will instantly whisk the Hero of Time to the entrance of the five dungeons, or send him back to the Master Sword's pedestal at the Temple of Time, making the navigation of Hyrule much easier.After Link awakens all six Sages, he returns to meet Sheik at the Temple of Time. Sheik tells Link that, although Ganondorf was the ruler of Hyrule, his victory of the land was not complete. Ganondorf only possessed one piece of the Triforce, the Triforce of Power. Link himself possessed the Triforce of Courage. The Triforce of Wisdom, on the other hand, was bound on the hand of a mysterious ""seventh sage"", the leader of the other six. To Link's (and the player's) shock, Sheik removes his mask and vestments, and reveals himself to be none other than the Princess Zelda! Her disguise was a ruse to keep the Princess out of Ganondorf's clutches to protect the Triforce of Courage. As the legendary Seventh Sage, Zelda uses her power to grant Link a weapon, the mystical Arrows of Time, that could penetrate any darkness and fill it with light. However, upon revealing her true self, Ganondorf captures the Princess and brings her to Hyrule Castle. Only Link can rescue her from his clutches, so he sets off to Ganon's castle, and ascends to the top and faces the Evil King. Zelda is released upon Link's victory, but the tower starts to collapse, and the two have to escape before they're buried along with it. She helps open the gates that will lead the two to the exit and escape just as the building is destroyed. After a final battle between Link and Ganon, Zelda uses her powers to hold Ganon in place so Link can deliver the final blow to the beast. She then uses her powers in conjunction with the six sages to seal Ganon within the Sacred Realm. With Hyrule saved, Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood, where he is supposed to be. </div>  <div> Reception : ""Hey!"" ""Listen!""Navi is one of the mysterious fairy's of the Deku Forest. We are introduced to Navi at the very start of the game when she wakes Link from his nightmare, telling Link the Deku Tree has sent her to aid Link on his journey.Navi is the secondary character that the player controls throughout the game with the new and innovative Z-Targeting mechanic. When the player presses and holds the Z-button, Navi will float over the nearest target in order to keep the players attacks directed to that object or enemy. As well as being a part of a mechanic, Navi is also one of the first characters to have voice acting. She will occasionally yell out ""Watch Out"" if there is something Link needs to....well, watch out for. She also says ""Hey"" when she has something important to tell Link, followed by a ""Listen"" when the player presses the Up C-button. After doing so Navi will give a hint as to what the player should be doing next in terms of the story line, just in case they are lost. </div>  <div> Nintendo 3DS Remake : GanondorfGanondorf (aka Dark Lord, Great King of Evil, and Man from the West) is the main villain in Ocorina of Time as well as most of the other Zelda games. Ganondorf is from the Gerudo Tribe which is made up primarily of women except for their King and is located in the desert to the west of Hyrule. Ganondorf came to power by simply being the chosen male child to be born every hundred years. He then uses his status as King of the Gerudo to make peace with the King of Hyrule and become an adviser to the king. As a young child Princess Zelda senses something dishonest and evil about Ganondorf as he is making a truce with her father. It is through this suspicion that Princess Zelda recruits Link to help her keep Ganondorf from achieving his goal, whatever it may be. Little do they know that Ganondorf will actually use Link as a pawn to get to the Triforce. </div>  <div> Overview : Forest </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Saria Main page: SariaThe sage Link saves from the Forest Temple, Saria is also a childhood friend of Link's. Unlike the other Kokiri that teased Link for lack of having a fairy, Saria spent time and often played together. When Link is told by the Great Deku Tree to leave the forest and go to Hyrule Castle, Saria gives him a Fairy Ocarina as a memento. Some moments later in the game, Link returns to the forest and finds Saria in the Sacred Forest Meadow, which is also the entrance to the Forest Temple as an adult. Here Saria teaches Link a new song for his Ocarina, that can let him communicate with Saria if he needs any advice. After becoming an adult and gaining the Hookshot, Link returns to the Sacred Forest Meadow, Saria's favorite spot, to see she isn't there. After fighting through the temple and defeating Phantom Ganon, Saria is saved and is awakened as the Sage of Forest, and gives Link the Forest Medallion.Fire </div> "

At the time of release, Nintendo was the owner of the Seattle Mariners, and Ken Griffey Jr. was the Mariners all star center fielder (Nintendo has since sold their majority stake in the team).  Nintendo used their authority as owners of the Mariners to feature Griffey Jr. in their game.  The game featured all the official teams, players, and parks that were a part of MLB at the time of release.  Griffey Jr. also supplied his voice for spoken commentary in the game.  </div>  <div> Gameplay  : This is Griffey's hitting cursor in Major League Baseball Major League Baseball featured robust features for a arcade style baseball game. There is a Exhibition, Season Mode, and Home Run Derby, and these modes act as they would in most baseball games. Every single player in the game had their stats used in the game, and they usually played according to their stats. In order to hit the ball you were given a cursur to line up with the ball and hit, and the players stats decided how big their cursor would be. Griffey Jr. for example had a large cursor considering his offensive stats at the time of release. Major League Baseball was a very simple and accessible game because of its arcade style set up. Games would often be high scoring because of it's arcade nature. You could make batting more difficult by removing your cursor or you could set the defense to manual allowing you to control defensive portions of the game. These changes could make the game considerably more difficult. Major League Baseball also featured multiplayer for players to compete in various modes. All of the game modes except for the Season Mode could be used for multiplayer. The game also had an interesting feature that would allow you to tour the stadiums in the league at the time. To tour the stadium you could use the analogue stick on N64 controller to move about the park.  Additionally the game featured various button command cheats, including one specifically that would allow Ken Griffey Jr to raise his bat towards the center field bleachers, essentially calling his shot. On the very next pitch, if the player made contact with the ball Griffey Jr would hit a homerun, no matter the location of the pitch. The command to perform the called shot is: Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Left, Left on the C-Buttons.  There are also two unlockable teams after the player wins the World Series in Season Mode. Players can go all 162 games, or if they choose they can pick ""Pennant Race"" as season duration and only play roughly 25 games, depending on a teams schedule. The unlockable teams were ""Angel Studios"", the developer, and ""Nintendo"", the games publisher. The names used for each teams were developers who worked on the game.  </div> "

It is the sequel to Super Mario Kart for the SNES and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from Mode 7 to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Bowser in Mario Kart 64At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use drifting and Mario themed weapons and items such as Turtle Shells and Mushroom Boosts to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.The game is separated into four play types, Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial. In each of these modes the player chooses from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and the player is tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If they achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, they are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a "" ghost"" of the best time, which is a translucent recording of the previous best lap. </div>  <div> Characters : The playable characters by category are: </div>  <div> Tracks : ToadPrincess PeachYoshi </div>  <div> Soundtracks : MarioLuigi </div>  <div> Mario Kart 64 Tracks : Donkey KongWarioBowserPlayer select screenLightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around.

Mario Party,Hudson Soft,Nintendo,8-Feb-99,n64,Mario Party is the first game in Nintendo's party game franchise. The game was well-received for its pick up and play gameplay.,3030-6424,6424,0,12/18/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/mario-party/3030-6424/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Mario Party is the first game in Nintendo's popular Mario Party franchise. Mario Party was released on February 8, 1999 in North America, December 14, 1998 in Japan, and March 9, 1999 in Europe and Australia. Mario Party was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. The release of Mario Party for the Nintendo 64 marked the beginning of Nintendo's long-running Mario Party franchise (which now contains eleven games total). Mario Party received generally positive reviews, currently holding a 77% average rating on Game Rankings and a 79% average rating on Metacritic. The game was criticized for not having an entertaining single-player, but was praised for its strong multiplayer elements.The game's story involves a group of Nintendo characters ( Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) arguing over who is the best. Each character brings up their strong aspect, saying that the one who is the best should have that aspect. Toad then suggests that they all take a journey to Mushroom Village, and during their adventures discover who is the best. The group then departs for Mushroom Village, to see who is the best of them all. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mushroom Village, the ""menu screen"" of the game.Mario Party establishes many of the gameplay aspects that have become standard in the Mario Party franchise. The player (or players in multiplayer) are placed on one of many ""boards"" (essentially stages or levels). These boards are separated by spaces (like a regular game board). The goal of the game is to collect the most stars. Only one star is on the board at one time, and it can be purchased for the price of 20 coins. The one other way to get stars is to steal them by using a Boo, who will steal another player's star for the price of 50 coins.Coins can be collected by landing on blue spaces on the game board or by winning minigames. Coins can then be used to purchase items and stars. In addition, if the game is a tie, then the player with the most coins will win. Coins can be lost as well; if the player lands on a red space, a Bowser space, or loses a certain minigame (not all minigames cause the loser to lose coins).At the end of a game, three bonus stars are granted to the players. One star goes to the person who had the most coins during the game (not total, at one point), one goes to the person who got the most coins during minigames, and one star goes to the person who landed on the most question mark spaces. If there is a tie for these awards, then the player who has the most coins will be awarded the star.Minigames are what Mario Party was most praised for. Mario Party has 56 minigames in all of four different types. These types are four player minigames (a free-for-all minigame), two versus two (where two players are on a team versus another team), one versus three (where one player with a large advantage competes against the other three), or one player minigames (they only occur when the player lands on a one-player minigame space, and give the player the opportunity to either gain or lose coins.A couple of the games minigames involve turning the analong stick in a circular motion as fast as possible. Players quickly relaized that the best strategy to winning was to place their palm flat on the analog stick and spin. This had an unfortunate side effect of the analog sick cutting into the players skin causing noticeable blisters. Nintendo, fearing a lawsuit, eventually offered free latex gloves to anyone who was hurt in this way. Subsequently, follow up games in the series replace this action with alternating between two face buttons rapidly. </div>  <div> Mini-Game Island : Artwork of Mario's Rainbow Castle.Mario's Rainbow Castle: A linear board where the path ends at the main tower, there the player will meet either Toad or Bowser.

Mario Party 2 was released on January 24, 2000 in North America, December 17, 1999 in Japan, October 12, 2000 in Europe, and November 6, 2000 in Australia. The game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo (as with every other game in the franchise besides Mario Party-e). Mario Party 2 was generally well-received from critics, garnering an average review score of 76% from Game Rankings. The game was criticized for not differing much from its predecessor, however.The plot of the game involves Mario and his friends creating a world called ""Mario Land,"" but then Wario wants to call the world ""Wario Land."" They begin arguing over the name, with other characters introducing their own names. As this is happening, Bowser decides to try and invade the world. Whoever can defeat Bowser will get the world named after them. </div>  <div> Gameplay : One of the game's many four player minigames.The goal of Mario Party 2 is to gather the most stars before the end of the game. To do this, players are placed on a game board (similar to that of a real life board game) in which they travel spaces each turn, gathering coins and items to the ultimate goal of a star. Coins can also be gathered by participating in minigames. The winner is presented with a set amount of coins, while the losers are rewarded with nothing.Mario Party 2 has several new features. Each character (Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) has a costume unique to each game board. So, depending on which board the game is on, the costume for the character changes to that certain theme. For example, if the players are in Space Land, then the characters will be dressed in space-related attire.The game also adds new spaces to the game board. In addition to adding buildings (which have their own spaces on the game board), Mario Party 2 adds a Battle Space, Item Space, and Bank Space. The battle space will trigger a battle minigame, which are introduced in this game. The item space begins a minigame that allows the player to win an item. The bank space opens up the Koopa Bank, giving whoever stepped on the bank space all coins currently in the bank.The minigames are what the Mario Party franchise is most known for. In addition to introducing the battle minigames, Mario Party 2 contains four player minigames, two versus two minigames, one versus three minigames, item minigames (triggered by the item space), and duel minigames. Four player minigames pit all four players into a free-for-all, two versus two is a team game with randomly selected teams, one versus three pits one player with an advantage versus the other three, and duel minigames are minigames between two players. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : ""Even when you win, you lose, Mario Party...""Jeff Gerstmann, (Mario Party Party 2) </div> "

Copies of the game have become very rare in Europe and are now sold online for very high prices. Mario Party 3 probably made the biggest additions and changes in the history of the series and because of this, hard core fans of the series are divided between those who love it dearly and those who desperately hate it. Many of the new additions made in this game did not make a return when the series shifted over to the GameCube with Mario Party 4. </div>  <div> Battle Royal : Battle Royal is the same mode that was used in previous Mario Party games. The objective is to move around the game board and collect as many stars as possible. The person who has the most stars by the end of the predetermined amount of turns wins. Players obtain stars at the Star Space for 20 coins. The Star Space is randomly determined and each time somebody gets a star, the Star Space moves to another location on the board. At the end of each turn, the 4 characters compete in a mini-game. The winner(s) of the mini-game receives 10 coins. To move around the board, players hit a 10-sided dice block, and the number they get determines how far they move. </div>  <div> Duel Mode : There are a total of 8 different spaces players can land on each board:Blue Space: The most frequent space on all of the boards. If you land on this, you will get 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and a blue status for that turn.Red Space: Landing on this will make you lose 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and give you a red status for that turn.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location. It will give you a green status for that turnBowser Space: The worse space to possibly land on. Bowser will bring up a roulette, each option with a horrible consequence, which includes losing stars and coins. This also gives a red status.Chance Time Space: A green space with an exclamation mark on top. This brings up a slot machine with 3 panels. The left and right panel are the playing characters while the middle one is the yield. Players can give a certain amount of coins or stars to the other player, or they could both swap coins or stars. This also gives a green status.Battle Space: All players must give up a certain amount of coins to the pot and play a mini-game. 1st place gets 70% and second place gets 30%.Item Space: One of the best spaces because there is a high reward and no risk. You either play an item mini-game to earn items or you get asked a question by Toad or Baby Bowser and they give you an item if you picked the right answer.

Landing on this space will give you all of the coins the Koopa Bank has collected. Landing here gives a green status.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost. </div>  <div> Story Mode : Duel mode was a completely new addition to the Mario Party series. In duel mode there are only two combatants instead of the usual 4. The objective here is different than Battle Royal; instead of collecting stars, the mission is to remove the enemy's 5 heart pieces. To do this, you can use a partner that you pay 10 coins for, and they will move in front of you. If you walk into the enemy, they will attack him or her which will result in lost heart pieces, depending on how strong the partner is. You can also have a partner be put behind you so you can use some defense. The partner you get is determined by a roulette. Partners also have a salary that you have to pay on a turn-basis. They will disappear if you cannot pay for their services. If both combatants are still alive by the end of the predetermined amount of turns, then the character with the most heart pieces wins. If they have the same amount of heart pieces, then the character with the most coins wins. If they still somehow have the same amount of heart pieces and coins, then the winner will be determined by who rolls a higher number on 10-sided dice block. </div>  <div> Mini-Games : There are some new spaces exclusively for the Duel Mode and some from Battle Royal. There are also others from Battle Royal that are not present in Duel Mode. The following are the spaces in Duel Mode:Normal Space: A normal, blank space. When you land on one, your characters face will mark it. If you land on the same space again, you will earn 5 coins. If enemy lands on it, you will receive 5 coins from them. You can also land it your enemy's space(s).Mini-Game Space: When this space is landed on, a mini-game begins and the winner receives 5 coins.Power-Up Space: When somebody lands on a Power-Up Space, his or her characters' stats will go up, however, so will their salary.Reverse Space: If landed on, you are forced to roll again and move in the opposite direction.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost. </div>  <div> Other Notable Additions : In story mode, the objective is to collect 7 star-stamps. In order to do this, you must win in Battle Royal and Duel Mode games. For each stamp you must first one a Battle Royal and then win a Duel Mode game. However, for the seventh stamp, you must beat a boss. After doing so, you beat the Story Mode. By beating it, the face of the character that you beat it with will be engraved into Mt. Mariomore, a play on the American monument, Mt. Rushmore. You will also unlock a hidden mini-game and unlock super hard difficulty if you beat Story Mode on hard.  </div> "

Milo's Astro Lanes,Player 1,Crave Entertainment,24-Nov-98,n64,Experience 22nd century bowling in a retro-futuristic style with Milo and friends.,3030-3405,3405,0,11/24/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/milos-astro-lanes/3030-3405/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The gameplay of Milo’s Astro Lanes is simple enough to understand: knock down all ten pins ten (eleven if you’re lucky!) times in a row, with two chances before they reset and your score for the round is marked down. These lanes – the things you roll the ball down – have been changed throughout the years, and now that it is the 22nd century it’s possible to bowl in space, on other planets and even in a park. There are two modes, a league mode for a single player to go through each setting the game has to offer and try to beat the computer, earning trophies and completing challenges as you go. There is also a multiplayer mode, where you choose your ball, character and level and compete against up to three other people in space bowling. Utilize eight different power-ups scattered throughout the levels to help yourself or hurt your foes, ranging from a goo ball to a white dwarf.  </div>  <div> Characters : There are six characters that you can play as: Milo, Ann Droid, Dr. Onuki, Nutian Warbler, Johnny Slamball, and 10 PIN. Each has their own distinct model making it easy for you to tell who you’re playing as in the heat of the moment, but they largely play the same.  </div>  <div> Lanes : There are twelve lanes in total in Milo’s Astro Lanes, five unique settings each with their own bowling alley. They range from a volcano on Venus, to the inside of an alien’s mouth, to a park! Hyperspace Express: Hyperspace Express is perhaps the most basic of the Astro Lanes, but it quickly becomes complex. The first incarnation is a simple lane with a short hop, but the second adds bumps and side lanes to the half before the hop. Express III adds a large hole in the center which makes it much harder to get to the pins without a gutter ball. Venus Vacation: How about Venus? Another fairly straightforward level, except the pins are located in an active volcano which regularly erupts and may disrupt your ball with a splash of the magma erupting from the top. Venus II creates a second chasm for you to hurdle and in the third the geometry itself begins to warp, making it hard to traverse the other red planet. Alien Invasion: A lane on a giant alien head’s tongue, this particular level comes in three flavors. The first is very basic, with no obstacles to speak of, but Invasion II brings an alien spaceship to zap the ball (and the tongue!), slowing it down. The alien will bite down on his own tongue in regular intervals, making it harder for you to hit the pins. Invasion III is the same as II but the lane has been shrunk down significantly, giving an added challenge. Asteroid Terror: Unlocked in the second tier of the tournament mode, Asteroid Terror is a fairly standard lane with some environmental hazards to beware of. The first version of it just has a short bump in the center and is a straightaway, but the second incarnation has a larger bump and spills out to make a bowl shape, though it’s a bit hard to miss the pins. Both versions come with blue rabbits that pop out and deflect your ball away, Terror II’s version having more places for these bunnies to show up. Nebulous Park: Nebulous Park is only available in the last tier of the levels in the league play. It is a park in space, with a large hill and a tree in the background that houses the pins. The hill is especially problematic in getting the pins to the ball safely, so it’s easy to see why this is reserved for those who have persevered through to the final area.  </div>  <div> Power-Ups : Throughout the course of the game there are power-ups scattered around the field in the form of colored stars. You can hold one of each star, and use each in an offensive and defensive way; the latter you may only use when it is your opponent’s turn. Green: An offensive use of the green star turns it into the turbo ball, which is good for getting your ball out of danger but tends to cause more problems than it solves. Using it on the enemy drops a goo ball, causing it to corrode and eventually disappear. Yellow: Using it on your own ball turns it into a megaball, arguably the strongest power-up in the game. Using it on the enemy turns it into the peaball, making it harder to hit the pins but it’s still possible to hit them so it’s not as useful as some of the powers that stop play completely. Red: Using it on yourself replaces your ball with a white dwarf; in effect, it resets the state of your current ball. Using the red star it on the enemy makes their ball bounce with the help of a spring, each getting higher until it eventually bounces into space. Blue: Using a blue star on yourself creates two clones at your side which is a good defensive use for green, red and blue stars that may be coming at you, as well as making it easier to get easy pins. Using the blue star on the enemy drops a bomb that explodes and destroys the main ball, but leaves all clones alone. </div> "

On her journey, she meets the citizens of Clancer, takes part in a Olympic style mini-game festival, fights agents of the Empire and faces off against the Emperor himself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is a side-scrolling platformer in which Marina's primary abilities are grabbing, shaking, and throwing objects as a means to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Shaking in particular has a wide range of effects such as causing enemies to drop gems or causing a projectile to grow larger before throwing it back at an enemy.The game had an unique mechanic involving the ending sequence and the collection of 52 ""golden gems,"" special items that could be obtained by performing special tasks within the game's levels and including shaking certain enemies, projectiles or bits of scenery, beating mini-games in record times or clearing a stage without being hit once in the case of the several boss battles. How much the player is allowed to watch the complete ending depended entirely on how many gems they collected, with each gem adding 3 seconds of viewing time. If there were not enough gems to watch the entire cutscene, the game would interrupt the sequence and urge the player (and Marina) to collect more. If the player collects all of the golden gems, Marina is transformed into a human girl at the very end of the game. </div>  <div> Characters : Marina Liteyears - The main protagonist of the game and the person the player controls.

The game makes a significant shift to 3D while introducing weapon-based combat to the franchise. The setting reverts from the gritty, Western look of Mortal Kombat 3 to mythical, Eastern look of the first two Mortal Kombat games.The game has three revisions within a year, fixing various bugs and adding new secrets, bugfixes and features. The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 in late June 1998, the PC in late July 1998, and was a launch title for the Sega Dreamcast under the name Mortal Kombat Gold. These home versions added exclusive content, including new characters and FMV intros, biographies, and endings. The game was also ported to the Game Boy Color in 1998 by Digital Eclipse.Taking place after the events of Mortal Kombat 3, the plot of Mortal Kombat 4 revolves around the war between the God of Thunder Raiden (along with the warriors of Earthrealm) and the fallen Elder God Shinnok (along with the evil sorceror Quan Chi and their army of darkness). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Despite the transition to 3D, the game plays very similarly to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Players have four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick), a Block button, and a Run button. Players have a Run Meter to prevent them from abusing the Run button, which gives them a quick dash forward for offensive manuevers. Players can now sidestep left and right (by tapping the Run button twice), allowing them to dodge projectiles and move the camera so that other players can not pick up items on the ground as easily.The ""chain combo"" system is still intact, where players use strings of normal attacks to perform a pre-programmed combo. However, Mortal Kombat 4 has added a ""Maximum Damage"" cap, automatically breaking off combos (in a similar vein to Killer Instinct's "" Combo Breaker"").One main concept introduced to the Mortal Kombat franchise in Mortal Kombat 4 is weapon-based combat. Players perform a specific button and joystick combination and the character would equip a weapon (usually a sword, an axe, or a club). The weapon deals more damage and changes certain attacks (Fujin's Crossbow, for example, can fire bolts). The weapon is knocked out of the player's hand on the first attack landed by an opponent, in which that weapon can be picked up by either player by pressing down on the joystick and the Run button. Some stages have objects (such as rocks in Goro's Lair) scattered around that can also be picked up and thrown at opponents.Some mechanics from Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 were scrapped, including Friendships, Babalities, Animalities, the ability to show "" Mercy"", eight-player tournament mode, and mid-match stage transitions. There are no Endurance Matches, instead bringing back 2-on-2 mode.This is the first Mortal Kombat game to not include palette swaps, as each character is visually unique. This also marks the first game to include the ability to select an alternate costume (by holding the Start button while selecting a character). </div>  <div> Characters : The fifteen playable fighters from the Arcade version.Mortal Kombat 4 included 15 playable characters in the original Arcade release, 7 of which are new additions to the series. It is the first main entry in the series where both boss characters are playable.With the exception of the handheld Game Boy Color version, all Home versions of the game added additional characters, all of which from previous Mortal Kombat games. This brings the grand total to 17 in the N64 and PS1 versions and 23 in the DC version.In addition, later Arcade and Home console releases included a secret easter egg that changes the player character's model to a bloody skeleton that was used in certain Fatalities (sometimes dubbed ""Meat""). A new original character was made based on this appearance in later Mortal Kombat games. </div>  <div> Arenas : Fujin - One of the last remaining Gods in Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, Fujin is the God of Wind and an ally of Raiden.Jarek (not available in the GBC version) - Believed to be the last remaining member of Kano's criminal organization, the Black Dragon, Jarek is a ruthless criminal who reluctantly assists Sonya and the other Earth warriors in defeating Shinnok's forces.Kai (not available in the GBC version) - A skilled African-American martial artist who trained under the White Lotus Society with Liu Kang before learning from great masters throughout Asia.Reiko - A former general of Shinnok's army who, after believed to be killed during Shinnok's war on the Elder Gods, resurfaces to fight the forces of Earth hand-to-hand.Tanya - The daughter of an Edenian ambassador, Tanya unknowingly let Shinnok invade Edenia for his base of operations. While she appears to assist Earth's forces, her true motives are unclear.Quan Chi (sub-boss) - A dark sorceror who uses his abilities to free Shinnok from his imprisonment in exchange for being his second-in-command.Shinnok (final boss, unplayable in the GBC version) - A fallen Elder God free from his banishment to the Netherrealm, waging a war against the Elder Gods (particularly Raiden).

It was later ported by Avalanche to the  Nintendo 64 on December 8, 1997.The first spin-off title in the  Mortal Kombat fighting game series, Mythologies focuses on a narrow group of primary characters while serving as a prologue to the original  Mortal Kombat (similar to  Mortal Kombat: Special Forces, released three years later). The game blends fighting game mechanics of  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 with a beat-em-up platformer, adding some elements of RPGs (such as an inventory system and experience points for learning new special moves). It is also the last Mortal Kombat game to feature  digitized characters and the only game in the series to have  live-action cutscenes.In the game, players take the role of the  original Sub-Zero (a ninja of the  Lin Kuei clan with the mastery of  frost-based attacks) who, after infiltrating the  Shaolin Temple to steal the Sacred  Map of Elements (defeating rival  Scorpion in the process), is sent by the mysterious sorceror  Quan Chi to retrieve a mysterious  amulet located in the Temple of Elements. It is revealed afterwards, however, that the sorceror is using this amulet to resurrect the dark fallen Elder God  Shinnok. After being confronted by  Raiden, god of thunder, the player must travel to the  Netherrealm, searching for the whereabouts of Quan Chi while fighting his three assassins (Kia, Jataaka, and  Sareena). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like Mortal Kombat 3, Mythologies consisted of 4 attack buttons, a block button, and a run button. The game also used a ""turn"" button to deal with attackers on either side of Sub-Zero, accompanied by an “action” button used for items. The gameplay took place on a 2D plane that consisted of a fighting system very similar to that of the Mortal Kombat fighting series. The ""turn"" button would alleviate the issue of Sub-Zero turning away from an opponent while performing a special move. Platforming was also part of the 2D scrolling gameplay. Sub-Zero’s special abilities extinguished an “Ice Meter” that was replenished by retrieving items.Sub-Zero does not start the game with all his special abilities. The aforementioned ""Ice Meter"" does not appear until Sub-Zero learns abilities that use it. The system is very RPG-like in nature as it tracks experience points, ability upgrades, and inventory. </div> "

Both PS1 and N64 versions differ in content, with some characters and stages only appearing on some versions.The PlayStation version was later ported to the Sega Saturn (on August 8, 1997) and PC (both MS-DOS and Windows on August 31, 1997) by Point of View. It was also loosely ported to the R-Zone and Game.Com. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Built upon the game engine in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat Trilogy include some new additions. Several characters have new special moves (including the bosses, which are now playable for the first time in the series). The devastating Brutality finishing move returns from the Genesis and SNES ports of UMK3, in which players can deliver a long and powerful combo that results in a gratuitous explosion of gibs.Exclusive to this game is the ""Aggressor"" bar, which is a super meter for each player that builds up as they land both successful and blocked hits on their opponent. Once the bar fills up for a player, their character moves faster and deals more damage for a short period of time before the bar resets.The Nintendo 64 version includes a new exclusive game mode, 3-on-3 Kombat, which plays exactly like 2-on-2 Kombat (only with three fighters each instead of two).

Nagano '98 represents the Winter Olympic Games that were held in Nagano. In Nagano '98 t he player has to either press different buttons, or simultaneously press two buttons back and forth, much like previously released Track & Field games, and play very similar to those, but winter sports. For the skiing, luge, and bobsledding all have similar control, with you taking control over your character or sleigh team, and skiing having you maneuver around colored flags. In ski jumping you'll have to press certain buttons at correct times, or hold them at tight timing while moving the d-pad to perfect yo ur landing. In curling you'll have to pick what curve and how much to sweep and so forth. Also, in skating you'll have to repeatedly tap two face buttons simultaneously as fast as you can without breaking formula to gain and keep speed throughout the event.There are also a few other events which can play similar in controls, or may tweak them a bit. Through the single player you'll have to qualify in seven events to advance, and the game will save high score progress, and will keep you trying to get the high score, with four player multiplayer as well.Multiplayer is also played similar to single player, as two -four players can challenge each other in random or chosen events for Gold, Silver, or Bronze, and fourth recieves nothing. At the end of all of the events the total medals will be added, and each medal counting for a different point tally, and whoever has the highest total point value at the end is victorious.High score can also be achieved by anyone and will be saved for that specific event.  </div>  <div> Events : Alpine Skiing (Downhill, Giant Slalom, and Super-G)BobsleighCurlingFreestyle Skiing (Aerials)LugeShort Track (500M and 1000M)Ski Jumping (Large Hill)Snowboard (Giant Slalom)Speed Skating (500M and 1500M)  </div>  <div> Teams : RussiaNorwayGermanyItalyUnited States of AmericaKoreaCanadaSwitzerlandNorwaySwedenJapanFranceChinaUnited KingdomHeard and McDonald IslandsSpain  </div> "
Namco Museum 64,NamcoGeneral Computer CorporationMass Media Games,Namco,31-Oct-99,n64,"Namco Museum 64 is a collection of classic games released on the Nintendo 64. These games include Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Pole Position, and Dig-Dug.",3030-13641,13641,0,11/29/1999,https://www.giantbomb.com/namco-museum-64/3030-13641/,ESRB: E," <div> Pac-Man :   Originally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response in Japan the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders,Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. The basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth (said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice, as well as the general idea of a mouth eating). In the 256 levels of the game, the player controls Pac-Man through a maze in which he has to eat up all the dots on the screen. But here's the catch: four ghosts, Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, inhabit each level and actively try to eat Pac-Man. If Pac-Man runs into any of the ghosts, a life is lost. If, however, Pac-Man eats any of the four ""power pellets"" found in the game, the ghosts become temporarily edible. If Pac-Man eats them, their eyes drift back into the center of the level to regenerate into their previous ghost form. Players can also get point bonuses by eating fruit pieces throughout the level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up the dots without being killed off. On July 3, 1999, scoring regulatory body Twin Galaxies recorded Billy Mitchell as the only player to complete all 256 levels with maximum points and no lives lost. This was especially difficult given that the last level of Pac-Man is ridden with bugs, with the right half of the screen featuring only garbled text. There's no question that Pac-Man is a seminal arcade classic and helped define an entire decade's pop culture.  </div>  <div> Ms. Pac-Man   :    The idea of Ms. Pacman was not by Namco, but by hackers. The first version of Ms. Pacman was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General  Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pacman cabinet, and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.Ms. Pac-Man Box Art (NES, Namco)  The programmers, showed it to Midway, who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto, and were getting upset over the long period of time between  the original Pac-man, and it's sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto, and added the Pac-man sprites, and the iconic name, Ms. Pacman to the once bootleg game. As Ms. Pacman became more and more popular, Namco noticed this very quickly. Midway had not gotten consent from Namco to publish the game in the first place, and with that a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against themselves, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-man to Namco. Afterwards, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles, while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game, that was soon becoming a cultural phenomenon.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ms. Pac-man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-man's gameplay of eating pellets, eating power pellets to eat ghosts, and eating numerous types of fruit. Though there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games. The first such change is the three scenes after each level is completed. They scenes tell the story of how they first meet, dating, and when the stork drops off their baby. The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue. The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts. The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and will leave through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player. The fruits order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, 5000.  The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each maze there are four different kinds of color, or style that is in each one. Each maze also now had two warp tunnels, that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze, as well as the walls now being filled in. (Pac-man had hollow walls.)   </div>  <div> Galaga    :    Released in 1981, Galaga has become one of the most popular arcade games of all time. Much more well received than its predecessor, Galaxian, Galaga features fast paced top-down shooting action. The player takes control of a small ship located at the bottom of the screen and is tasked with destroying the incoming waves of insect-like enemies.Tractor-beam </div>  <div> Galaxian  : Player ship movement is restricted to only the left and right.  Upon the start of a level, waves of enemies fly in formation and complete a flight pattern before positioning themselves at the top of the screen. It is ideal to destroy the incoming ships before they complete their fly-in. Once in formation at the top of the screen, enemies will regularly break off to attack. Enemy ships attack by dropping bombs and/or colliding with the player's ship.The most popular and effective strategy is for the player to sacrifice their own ship to a ""Boss Galaga"" ship. These ships hover above the player and emit a tractor-beam. Entering this beam will sacrifice the current ship and allow the player to use on of the reserves. Destroying the ""Boss Galaga"" will reclaim the captured ship. The player is then rewarded with double-ships which effectively doubles the player's firepower.Additionally, a bonus stage occurs every four levels, allowing the player to earn extra points without the risk of being destroyed.   </div>  <div> Pole Position :  Originally released in 1979, Galaxian was one of the early arcade games that is still considered a classic. Developed by Namco and released by Midway, it is a fixed shooter arcade game, and is characteristic of the genre, which was created by the release ofSpace Invaders a year earlier. Galaxian stays true to the formula established by Space Invaders, in that you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and must destroy groups of ships at the top of the screen by means of shooting. The main gameplay addition offered by Galaxian to the Space Invaders formula is the kamikaze like behavior of enemy ships. The rate of shooting is relatively slow, however your weapon is reloaded immediately upon a successful hit. Once a wave is conquered, another one, with increased difficulty, would replace it.Galaxian also offered multi colored animated sprites (including explosions), theme music, background music, and representative icons to indicate number of lives left. These were not brand new additions to video games, however Galaxian's use of them would influence game development over the next several years.The game was considered a success and spawned the even more successful sequel, Galaga, in 1981. Galaxian's success drove the development of several versions for various home consoles, and can found collected in various Namco Museum collections for modern day consoles.         </div>  <div> Dig-Dug :  Pole Position was an arcade game released in 1982, developed by Namco. The game is seen as revolutionary for its popularization of sprite based, pseudo-3D graphics. It was one of the first games to use the ""rear-view racer format"" that would change the way in which racing games were developed.  Pole Position was also one of the first games to feature in-game advertising. When looking for a publisher in the United States, Namco originally approached Midway with a choice between two games, Pole Position or Mappy. Midway chose Mappy and Namco turned to Atari to publish the game. Midway would miss out on a large opportunity as Pole Position became one of the most popular arcade games of 80s and was ported to an assortment of different consoles. The game even spawned its own Saturday morning cartoon show on CBS.        </div>  <div> Enemies :  You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a ""kill screen"" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series, Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include : Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber), Eggplant,  Green Pepper, Tomato, Garlic, Watermelon, Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco'sGalaxian. </div> "

Along with a custom name, uniform color, wacky head, and a ""nickname"" for the announcer, players can distribute their attributes from a limited point pool (which gets larger the more that player wins).The game later received ports for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis on November 1996, both ported by Funcom and published by Midway themselves (rather than Acclaim, who previously published ports of NBA Jam). It was later ported by Midway Studios San Diego and Director's Cut International to the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Windows PCs in early 1997.Earlier versions of NBA Hangtime (as well as the home versions) included a NBA trivia quiz after each game for bragging rights, additional attribute points (home version only), and a chance to win prizes (arcade version only). The game later received an update in November 1996 as NBA Maximum Hangtime, updating the roster to match the 1996-97 season while adding new secrets and a new ""hot spots"" system, where each basketball player has a hidden spot on the court where they shoot more accurately. It was later succeeded by NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : TeamPlayersAtlanta HawksStacey AugmonMookie BlaylockSteve SmithChristian LaettnerKen NormanBoston CelticsDee BrownDana BarrosEric MontrossDino RadjaRick FoxCharlotte HornetsKenny AndersonLarry JohnsonGlen RiceGeorge ZidekDell CurryChicago BullsScottie PippenDennis RodmanToni KukocLuc LongleySteve KerrCleveland CavaliersTyrone HillChris MillsBobby PhillsTerrell BrandonDanny FerryDallas MavericksJim JacksonJason KiddJamal MashburnPopeye JonesGeorge McCloudDenver NuggetsMahmoud Abdul-RaufDikembe MutomboAntonio McDyessJalen RoseDale EllisDetroit PistonsJoe DumarsGrant HillTerry MillsOtis ThorpeAllan HoustonGolden State WarriorsKevin WillisLatrell SprewellRony SeikalyJoe SmithChris MullinHouston RocketsHakeem OlajuwonClyde DrexlerRobert HorrySam CassellKenny SmithIndiana PacersReggie MillerDale DavisRik SmitsDerek McKeyMark JacksonLos Angeles ClippersLoy VaughtRodney RogersLamond MurrayPooh RichardsonBrent BarryLos Angeles LakersNick Van ExelVlade DivacCedric CeballosElden CampbellEddie JonesMiami HeatAlonzo MourningWalt WilliamsRex ChapmanTim HardawayPredrag DanilovicMilwaukee BucksVin BakerGlenn RobinsonShawn RespertBenoit BenjaminSherman DouglasMinnesota TimberwolvesIsaiah RiderAndrew LangSpud WebbTom GugliottaKevin GarnettNew Jersey NetsKendall GillShawn BradleyArmon GilliamEd O'BannonKevin EdwardsNew York KnicksPatrick EwingAnthony MasonDerek HarperCharles OakleyJohn StarksOrlando MagicAnferenee HardawayHorace GrantNick AndersonDennis ScottJon KoncakPhiladelphia 76ersJerry StackhouseDerrick ColemanClarence WeatherspoonTrevor RuffinVernon MaxwellPhoenix SunsKevin JohnsonWayman TisdaleDanny ManningWesley PersonMichael FinleyPortland Trail BlazersRod StricklandClifford RobinsonArvydas SabonisBuck WilliamsRandolph ChildressSacramento KingsBilly OwensMitch RichmondBrian GrantSarunas MarciulionisTyus EdneySan Antonio SpursSean ElliotDavid RobinsonAvery JohnsonChuck PersonVinny Del NegroSeattle SupersonicsShawn KempGary PaytonDetlef SchrempfHersey HawkinsSherell FordToronto RaptorsCarlos RogersDamon StoudamireAlvin RobinsonOliver MillerTracey MurrayUtah JazzJohn StocktonKarl MaloneJeff HornacekDavid BenoitChris MorrisVancouver GrizzliesGreg AnthonyBlue EdwardsByron ScottBryant ReevesEric MurdochWashington BulletsJuwan HowardChris WebberCalbert CheaneyRobert PackGeorghe Muresan </div> "

Enlisting the help of local resistance fighter Naja Hana, STRIKE liberates Indocine from Lemonde's influence but is unable to capture the device, instead tracking the radiation signature to the Lavu Royale, a small island chain somewhere in the South China Sea. Though the islands are under the watch of Napoleon Hwong, a warlord for the reigning Octad, the intervention of STRIKE and a local gun for hire Harding Cash cuts down many of the Octad's operations in the surrounding region and eliminate the warlord himself.

Follow freedom fighter Magnus Gallant as he fights to abolish the class system in Palatinus. Choose from dozens of character classes to customize your army any way you want.,3030-14506,14506,0,7/14/1999,https://www.giantbomb.com/ogre-battle-64-person-of-lordly-caliber/3030-14506/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber is a sequel to the  SNES game  Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen released in 1993.It has many of the same gameplay mechanics as it's predecessor but boasts better graphics, more classes and a longer quest. Ogre Battle 64 is a Strategy RPG but differs from most RPGs in that the player doesn't have direct control over the combat. Instead the player directs units and the battles play out in a sequence of characters attacking one another until they run out of attacks or wipe out the other side. Like, the original, there are many choices to be made throughout the story and decide which one of the multiple ending the player gets upon beating the game. The game can easily be over 100 hours for most players, especially with the ability to go back to previous stages and find hidden items and sub quests. </div>  <div> Story : You follow  Magnus Gallant, a fresh graduate of the military academy and new recruit of the Palatinius Army. After witnessing injustice to the lower class of Palatinus first-hand during his first few missions as a soldier, he decides to join the Revolutionary Army. Magnus and his revolutionary army then set out to liberate all of Palatinius and abolish the class system. Along the way he will fight fellow countrymen, the Lodis empire, denizens of the Netherworld, and his best friend. Depending on the choices the player makes there are three possible endings. Varying from Palatinus ending up in chaotic disorder to Magnus becoming the new king and the Golden Age of Palatinus. </div>  <div> Gameplay : There are two different screens where the player has control over the game. The first is the pre-mission menu screen. Here, the player can do a number of things. Such as detailed information on characters and events to keep you updated on the huge story, a place to train you troops, and the organization of your troops. The immense amount of character classes is iconic of the  Ogre Battle franchise. There are dozens of different classes and weapons to choose from and hundreds of ways to micro-manage your troops. The second gameplay screen is the battle screen. Once the battle has started the game takes you to an overhead view of the battlefield. Here you deploy different units from your stronghold, up to ten. Units are groups of up to 5 soldiers on a 3x3 grid and appear as one character on the battlefield and can be commanded to move, attack, and liberate cities on the map.When a friendly unit encounters an enemy unit, the screen switches to the battle screen. Unlike most RPG's, the player only has limited control over what happens in the battle by setting basic tactics such as attacking the enemy units leader or attacking the weakest character in the unit. The soldiers on each side take turns attacking each other, until all characters run out of attacks or one side is wiped out. The player can maximize his units efficiency by strategically placing the soldiers in the grid. If the leader of a unit is killed the unit will cease moving and simply run away from any enemy unit that approaches it unless a new leader is assigned. The player can achieve victory by liberating the enemy stronghold or by defeating all other units in a normal battle. The player loses if Magnus is killed or if their stronghold is overtaken.Ogre Battle 64 added a feature that lets the player save where they are in a map to resume to later, rather than having to play through the entire map before saving. This was a welcome addition to most players, as the original Ogre Battle didn't have this feature, forcing players to finish maps that can take several hours to finish or else restart the mission. </div>  <div> Rarity : Ogre Battle 64 is a fairly rare game to buy used. Not many games were produced initially, despite a good reception from critics and fans of the genre. Even after the next generation of consoles was released and right before  Gamestop stopped selling used  Nintendo 64 games, the game sold for roughly $25, while most other Nintendo 64 games sold for $0.99 to $5. </div> "

The game encouraged stealth over action in keeping with the N64 game.The game made use of many of the features of the hardware. A two player deathmatch mode made use of the link cable, unlockable stickers could be printed using the Game Boy printer or traded with other players via the infra-red port and the cartridge had a built-in rumble feature. If used in conjunction with the N64 Transfer Pak, the game could be used to unlock four cheat modes in N64 Perfect Dark - All Weapons, Claoking Device, Hurricane Fists and R-Tracker. </div> "

This installment in the franchise continues the flight simulator themes with arcade style gameplay. Flight missions are given on four different stages, with the player able to choose from six different characters. Three different vehicles are also available for standard missions; the Hang Glider, Rocket Belt and Gyrocopter. </div>  <div> Mission Structure : Specific mission goals depend on the class of vehicle, however most missions follow the formula of takeoff, task completion and proper landing. Tasks vary from flying through a series of floating rings, to landing on checkpoints, and to taking judged pictures. Missions are also usually based on a time limit, where points are detracted once the player exceeds the time allotted.For each mission, 100 points are possible for a Perfect Score from the player. Badges are awarded for obtaining certain point levels, as in a Silver Badge is awarded for the Rocket Belt after passing an average of 80 points or higher on each Rocket Belt mission.When landing is required, the player is judged on impact and accuracy. Too hard of an impact anywhere in the level will cause the pilot to crash the plane and the mission to be failed. After each failure, the game offers textual tips for improving the player’s piloting skills.Each level of difficulty for the classes of vehicles is designated to a specific island, all four of which display unique traits. The player is also free to choose any character at any given time, which are separated into light, medium, and heavy pilots. </div>  <div> Pilots : The pilots’ names are taken from bird names in the American version of the game. The lightweight pilots are Kiwi, the girl, and Lark, the boy. These are ideal for the Rocket Belt, as they display an increased maneuverability and speed. The medium weight pilots are Ibis, the woman, and Goose, the man, both of which are suited for the Hang Glider. The heaviest pilots, the woman Robin, and Hawk, the male, are best fitted for the Gyrocopter. </div>  <div> Vehicle Classes : The analog stick controls the Hang Glider’s movement, while an additional button can flare the glider’s wings for speed adjustments. Pilots must ensure they stay in the air long enough to complete the tasks while also landing properly. Hot air columns allow the Hang Glider to receive a significant amount of lift. Photography is also designated to Hang Glider missions, with each photo being stored in the photo album.The Rocket Belts are more complicated than the Hang Gliders, allowing the player to control a jet pack that sends the player hovering at high altitudes and high speeds. Two buttons are designated to different amounts of thrust, one at full engine power, and the other at half. Hovering is also possible by the trigger button, allowing precise pilot movement, proving the Rocket Belt to be a favorite among many players.The Gyrocopter takes off and lands similar to an airplane, with in flight controls responding similarly. Extremely low speeds are possible due to the helicopter fashioned design, but high speeds are also easily attainable during timed missions. The Gyrocopter is also equipped with a missile launcher while players have access to an unending supply of missiles. These are often used to either hit practice targets, or defeat the only enemy in the game, the Godzilla-like “Meca Hawk.” </div>  <div> Additional Modes : The Birdman mode equips pilots with bird-like wings attached to their arms. During these stages, the player is free to explore the island at their leisure, as this is not a timed mission, nor are there any tasks. The different weather modes are also available, ranging in sunny, cloudy, evening and night.Sky Diving is also another mode where the pilots must complete in air formations with a following parachute landing on specific targets. The player only has a limited amount of time to complete each formation, as the altitude drops rapidly during the freefall.A Cannonball mode lets players aim their pilot in a giant canon, and shoot them out towards a target, similarly to a circus clown as the missions’ soundtrack suggests.The Jumble Hopper fits the pilots with oversized boots, propelling the pilot vertical and forward with force, as the goal is to reach the destination in as few hops as possible. Landing in river water will not cause the player to crash, however, points will be deducted from the final score. </div>  <div> Locations : Holiday Island is the starting location for each class of vehicle. This island is the smallest in the game, featuring attractions such as an amusement park complete with a Ferris wheel, and a mountaintop mansion.Crescent Island features a beach location, as well as an extensive cave system cutting through its main mountain ridge. Many coastal homes can be seen on the outskirts of the island, while the inside features resorts, complete with pools and tennis courts. Luxury liners also inhabit the waters nearby.Ever-Frost Island is an island permanently covered in snow, featuring tall peaks and sharp vertical drops. An oil refinery sits between some of the small islets, while a ski resort is build upon the main island.The Little States is a miniature replica of the United States, with a shrunken Mississippi River, Grand Canyon, and Rocky Mountain region. Major cities are represented as small groupings of skyscrapers, while some national monuments, such as the Washington Monument, or Mount Rushmore, exist in smaller scale. Mount Rushmore, in fact, features the likeness of Mario next to the American presidents. </div> "
Pokémon Puzzle League,Nintendo Software Technology,Nintendo,25-Sep-00,n64,"A Pokémon-themed version of Tetris Attack for the Nintendo 64, and the only videogame to date to actually feature characters from the Pokémon anime such as Ash Ketchum, Nurse Joy, and Team Rocket members Jessie and James.",3030-8052,8052,0,9/1/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-puzzle-league/3030-8052/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Pokémon Puzzle League is a Pokémon-themed version of the Super Nintendo game Panel de Pon, also known as Tetris Attack in North America. It was originally developed as Panel de Pon 64, a direct sequel to Panel de Pon, before being canceled in development and reworked as a Pokémon game. The game was originally released for the Nintendo 64, and was later re-released as a Virtual Console title on the Nintendo Wii. The game can be played in standard 2D mode or a 3D mode in which the player can rotate the field. As in Tetris Attack, the goal of the game is to clear blocks from the field by lining up three or more blocks of the same color horizontally or vertically. The game includes several modes of play including a single-player vs. mode against the CPU, a two-player versus mode, and challenge modes including a time attack, puzzle mode, and line-clearing mode.Pokémon Puzzle League is unique among Pokémon games in that it is one of the very few games to use characters originally created for the Pokémon anime series as opposed to the characters actually featured in the games. It also features art and brief animated cinematics from the anime, as well as voice acting from the anime series' English cast. </div>  <div> Characters : The game features fifteen characters that appear in the anime. They all use three Pokémon each.Ash Ketchum - Pikachu, Squirtle, BulbasaurMisty - Horsea, Psyduck, StaryuBrock - Geodude, Vulpix, ZubatTracey Sketchit - Marill, Venonat, ScytherTeam Rocket ( Jessie, James, and Meowth) - Weezing, Arbok, GolbatGary Oak - Nidoran, Growlithe, KrabbyGiovanni - Persian, Sandslash, NidokingRitchie - Sparky ( Pikachu), Zippo ( Charmander), Happy ( Butterfree)Bruno - Onix, Hitmonchan, PrimeapeErika - Tangela, Weepinbell, GloomSabrina - Abra, Hypno, AlakazamBlaine - Arcanine, Charmeleon, MagmarLt.

Players take on the role of Todd Snap who is called by Professor Oak to an unknown island to study the different types of Pokémon who live on it. Of course, the only way to do this is to take pictures of them or to ""snap"" a picture while riding a buggy named ""Zero-One."" Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit to a location with the best pictures able to be submitted for scoring. Items are also used by the player to interact with the pokémon potentially allowing higher scores or level advancement. </div>  <div> Plot : Pokémon researcher Professor Oak is in his Lab researching pokemon on Pokémon Island when he calls in famous photographer Todd Snap to help him take pictures of the various Pokémon found on the island. Towards the end of the game Professor Oak discovers that there are many mysterious Pokémon ""signs"" found on the island and he also tasks Todd with catching pictures of these. At the very end Oak gives Todd one last task, he requests that he gets a picture of the elusive Mew in the secret Rainbow Cloud course. </div>  <div> Scoring : Scoring happens after the end of a level when the player either enters the exit portal at the end of a track or runs out of film to photograph more pokémon, and consists of looking through the pictures you've taken in that level and picking the ones that you feel will receive high marks from Professor Oak. There are five different aspects of scoring which include:Special - This includes how rare the Pokémon is. For example you will get more points for taking a picture of Moltres than taking a picture of a common Meowth.Size - The bigger the Pokémon is in the frame the more points you will get.Pose - If the Pokémon is doing something obscure, like dancing or looking mean, then you get more points.Technique - There is only really one basic function to this...if the Pokémon is in the center of the shot, your score is doubled.Same Pokémon - If there is more than one of the same Pokémon in the frame you get more points. </div>  <div> Locations : There is a total of seven locations in which to take pictures, each with its own type of Pokémon. The seventh level is only unlocked when the player has taken a picture of the ""Pokemon Signs"" which are objects that look like certain Pokemon. Once all six of the Pokémon Signs are photographed then the seventh level is unlocked where the player then attempts to photograph the rare Mew.BeachTunnelVolcanoRiverCaveValleyRainbow Cloud </div>  <div> Items : During the course of the game, Professor Oak will give you various items to use to interact with Pokemon in the environment. </div>  <div> The Pokemon :  This is a thrown item. It can be used as bait to lure Pokémon toward particular places, or to bring them out of hiding. You can also hit Pokémon with the apple to get their attention. It is infact an apple-shaped ball of Pokémon food. </div>  <div> Getting Real Life Versions of Your Pictures :  This is another thrown item which, upon contact, explodes into a powder-like deterrent. This works best for driving Pokémon out of hiding and into the open, although it will usually agitate them. </div> "

One type is a top down shooter where a Power Ranger is the playable character, the A button is used to shoot forward and the B button to shoot behind. The player moves around the area collecting coins or saving hostages. The second gameplay type is a 3D sidescrolling mode where the player controls a car. The goal is either to shoot water to put out flaming cars or run over toxic waste to clean it up. The third type is a semi mech game where the player is inside the Lightspeed Megazord and must defeat the enemies on screen. The final game type is sort of a flying game.

Quake,id SoftwareMidway Studios - San Diego,Midway Home EntertainmentNAGT InteractivePAL,24-Mar-98,n64,"The follow-up to id's 1993 game Doom, and one of the earliest first-person shooters to make full use of 3D polygonal graphics and level design. Featuring a dark and gritty atmosphere inspired by gothic and Lovecraftian fiction, players traverse numerous dimensions in an attempt to stop the invasion of eldritch forces led by the mysterious ""Quake"".",3030-8015,8015,0,7/23/1996,https://www.giantbomb.com/quake/3030-8015/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Official screenshots often conveyed an atmosphere of chaos.Quake is a sci-fi horror-fantasy first-person shooter developed by id and published by GT Interactive for MS-DOS and Windows PCs on July 23, 1996. The first episode was originally released by id as shareware on June 22, 1996.The successor to id's 1993 game Doom, Quake puts players in the role of a lone unknown US soldier on Earth as he fights the mysterious and hostile extra-dimensional force codenamed ""Quake"". Through the use of an experimental teleportation technology (known as the ""Slipgate"") from overrun military bases, the protagonist must traverse through various dimensions across time and space (each filled with dark magic, hellish beings, and eldritch horrors) to acquire magic runes and take on the mastermind itself (which is revealed to be the elder god Shub-Niggurath). Along with its gritty atmosphere, the game is known for its atmospheric CD soundtrack by Trent Reznor (the front-man for the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails).The game expands on the 3D game engine used in Doom, bringing full-3D polygonal graphics and full-3D level design (rather than 2D blueprints) into the traditional first-person shooter genre. It had early support for hardware 3D acceleration through OpenGL, and is believed to be a catalyst for the modern GPU industry. It also adds features from similar games at the time (such as vertical camera tilting, manual jumping, swimming, and easier control customization). It is known for being one of the few games of its time to not include a dedicated key for activating (or ""using"") switches and other objects, instead having players bump into (or shoot) them.It also expands on Doom's multiplayer component, allowing player customization while allowing players to manage connections from the game itself and adding support for the TCP/IP networking model for modern online multiplayer. An enhanced version of the game, known as ""QuakeWorld"", was released as a free update later that year that revamped the networking code, adding client-side prediction for higher-latency connections. It is one of the earliest examples of modern online multiplayer, and is believed to be a progenitor of eSports.The game's engine also expands on the concept of modability by having all game logic separate from the main engine, allowing both licensed and hobbyist developers to use a built-in scripting language (known here as QuakeC) to change the core gameplay without needing access to the main game's source code. Along with some licensed products (such as Hexen II and X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse), numerous fan-made mods were developed using this engine, some of which were later expanded into successful franchises (such as the Team Fortress and Counter-Strike series). The game's complete source code was later released as open source on December 21, 1999 under the GNU General Public License, allowing for expanded source ports.Along with two licensed ""mission packs"" (Scourge of Armagon by Hipnotic and Dissolution of Eternity by Rogue), the game received two official console ports (a Nintendo 64 version by Midway and a Sega Saturn version by Lobotomy) and two official computer ports (one for Linux and one for Mac OS). It later received a full-blown sequel, known as Quake II, that expands on the technological fidelity of the Quake engine while abandoning its fantasy theme for an unrelated sci-fi story. The game's engine was also used as the base for Valve's GoldSrc engine, which was used for the 1998 game Half-Life and spawned the Source engine series. The original Quake, as well as its expansions, were digitally released by id via Steam on May 31, 2007 (albeit without the original soundtrack).In celebration of the game's 25th anniversary, the game received an enhanced digital update for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC (the last of which is distributed as a game update) on August 19, 2021. Created by Nightdive Studios and utilizing their KEX Engine, this version features modern graphical options (such as widescreen support and dynamic lighting), updated accessibility options (including UI and controls), and new multiplayer options (including online matchmaking, split-screen, and bots). Along with the original game, this version includes both mission packs and two bonus expansions by MachineGames (""Dimension of the Past"", which was created for the game's 20th anniversary, and ""Dimension of the Machine"", which was created for this version). Similar to the enhanced 2019 update for Doom, this version includes curated mods (or ""add-ons"") that are optional, with the first being a recreation of the game's Nintendo 64 port. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Difficulty settings are chosen in-game.Just like Doom before it, Quake is a fast-paced FPS with a linear progression of levels broken up into episodes. The objective of each level is simply to reach the exit, killing anything dangerous along the way. There are numerous obstructions to slow the player's progress, such as traps and locked doors which must be bypassed using buttons, keycards or keys.Despite these additional considerations, however, Quake is almost entirely focused upon ""run and gun"" first-person action. After each level, the player is presented with level statistics showing their total completion time as well as the number of enemies killed and secrets discovered compared to the maximum.Quake's four episodes can be tackled in any order, though there is an intended sequence. At the beginning of each episode, the player starts with only the Shotgun and the Axe, and weapons collected in each episode are not carried over to the next. Once the player has completed all four episodes and gathered the four magical runes within them, the pathway to Shub-Niggurath and the final confrontation is opened. </div>  <div> Weapons : The weapons of Quake are a pretty straightforward affair, consisting almost entirely of point-and-shoot armaments with no alternate firing modes. In fact, the Grenade Launcher is the only ranged weapon in Quake that does not travel in a straight path toward its target. Despite this simplicity, or perhaps because of it, the Quake arsenal has become quite iconic, and the Rocket Launcher in particular is an object of affection for many Quake fans.Axe </div>  <div> Items :  One of Quake's two starting weapons, the Axe is the only melee weapon available, and is generally cannot be recommended unless there are no alternatives. Since almost all enemies possess ranged weaponry, getting close enough without taking damage is tricky. Even if one can close the distance safely, very few enemies are without a melee attack of their own, so there is no immediate advantage in most situations to bringing out the Axe.Shotgun </div>  <div> Enemies :  The Shotgun, Quake's second starting weapon, presents a much more attractive alternative to the Axe, though it is only marginally more powerful. Firing six pellets at a time at a fairly steady rate, weaker enemies like the Grunt go down very quickly to the Shotgun, though it won't be long before heavier weapons are required. It has a much tighter spread than the Super Shotgun, making it the preferred weapon of the two when enemies are at medium to long range.Super Shotgun </div>  <div> Bosses :  Firing fourteen pellets to the Shotgun's six, the Super Shotgun not only deals a greater amount of damage per shot, but is also more efficient in terms of damage per shell. The trade-off comes in its range, as outside of close combat it is very unlikely that all pellets will hit. Still, closing the distance in order to maximize damage is often worthwhile. Many creature will perish under only a few volleys from the Super Shotgun, and shells are generally plentiful, making the SSG consistently useful.Nailgun </div>  <div> Maps :  Capable of firing a steady stream of nails from its double barrels, the Nailgun is an accurate medium-damage weapon held back somewhat by the relative paucity of nail ammunition in the game. It is also less useful against extremely powerful enemies, as there are generally better options that don't require constant line-of-sight. The Nailgun can expend a full load in just twenty seconds.Super Nailgun </div>  <div> Multiplayer :  While it fires at the same rate as the Nailgun, each round from the Super Nailgun is twice as powerful. It also consumes ammo twice as fast, meaning sustained fire will drain a full clip of two-hundred nails in just ten seconds! Nevertheless, when dangerous enemies are afoot, the expedient damage provided by the Super Nailgun is quite handy, as long as each round hits.Grenade Launcher </div>  <div> Modifications :  Fires a grenade in an arc that will either explode on contact with an enemy or detonate automatically after a few seconds. The simplicity of Quake's AI makes it a fairly simple matter to lay traps for enemies, and aside from having to account for the trajectory, it is just as useful as the Rocket Launcher. Though not as easy as rocket jumping, it is possible to perform grenade-assisted jumps in order to jump higher or increase one's speed.Rocket Launcher </div>  <div> Speedrunning :  The go-to weapon for both single-player and multiplayer, the Quake Rocket Launcher deals massive damage with its easy-to-aim explosive projectile and generous splash damage. In addition to its utility as a weapon, the Rocket Launcher became a popular means of assisted mobility in multiplayer and during speed runs, as ""rocket jumping"" allows players to launch themselves in almost any direction at incredible speeds.Lightning Gun </div>  <div> Plot :  Causing more damage per second than any other weapon, the Lightning Gun is a weapon that, like the Nailguns, suffers only from its limited ammo availability. It can take down any single-player foe in no more than two seconds, and even fully armored multiplayer opponents cannot survive it for long. It does requires a larger degree of precision than the Rocket Launcher, however, and overall it is the less sought-after of the two. Discharging the Lightning Gun underwater will expend all the player's cells, killing anything in sight, including the player. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Quake items can be divided into two types: Health and Armor Pickups, which provide beneficial effects that are generally permanent, and Power-ups, which grant abilities in 30-second durations that are often extremely powerful. It is also worth mentioning that Quake marks the first appearance of Quad Damage, a power-up which would become synonymous with the Quake franchise. </div>  <div> Minimum System Requirements : Health Packs </div>  <div> Secrets :  The most readily available method of vitality recovery in Quake, Health Packs come in two varieties, which heal either 15 or 25 hit points. The two types can be easily differentiated from one another on sight due to the fact that the more powerful of them is much more brightly colored. Neither will heal the player past 100 hit points.Megahealth </div>  <div> Playing Quake on modern systems :  Megahealth is the ultimate Quake health pickup, bestowing a full 100 hit points upon use which is capable of healing a player beyond the normal 100-point cap. While this is a powerful boon, it is also ultimately a temporary one, as any hit points in excess of 100 will gradually deteriorate over time. For this reason, it can be a good idea in single-player to pick it up when one's health is fairly low in order to avoid losing extra points.Green Armor </div>  <div> Useful links :  The most basic form of protection in the game, Green Armor provides 100 points of damage mitigation. Armor types in Quake not only come with different armor point totals, but also have varying degrees of damage absorption, which determines how quickly the armor is consumed. Green Armor absorbs 30% of all damage done to the player, meaning it has the slowest rate of consumption among Quake armor types.Yellow Armor </div> "
Quake II,id SoftwareRaster Productions,Activision,30-Jun-99,n64,The second installment of id Software's Quake series of fast-paced first-person shooters abandons the original's Lovecraftian theme for a hard sci-fi aesthetic. A lone space marine must infiltrate the homeworld of a hostile bio-mechanical race known as the Strogg and prevent them from invading Earth.,3030-3207,3207,0,12/9/1997,https://www.giantbomb.com/quake-ii/3030-3207/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Stroggos, the central location of Quake IIQuake II is a sci-fi horror first-person shooter developed by id and published by Activision for Windows PCs on December 9, 1997.The sequel to the 1996 game Quake, Quake II foregoes the Lovecraftian story and atmosphere in favor of a hard sci-fi aesthetic (while still retaining some of its grit). It was originally planned to be an entirely unique IP, although its gameplay similarities allowed it to stick with the ""Quake"" name. Along with being more mission-based (with different types of objectives), the game includes seamless levels that allow players to travel back-and-forth between them (which are required to complete certain objectives). It also includes a harder industrial-metal CD soundtrack, most of which are from the musician Sonic Mayhem (who previously did an alternate soundtrack for Quake).The game's main campaign is set on the planet Stroggos, homeworld of the hostile bio-mechanical race known as the Strogg. In a desparate attempt to prevent the Strogg from invading Earth, the Terran Coalition of Man (TCM) stages a counter-attack against Stroggos known as ""Operation Alien Overlord"". Players take control of a lone marine (later known as ""Bitterman""), whose drop pod crash-lands away from the staging area due to an E.M.P. blast from the Stroggos planetary defense system (or ""Big Gun""). As the last remaining survivor, the marine must single-handedly destroy their way from teleporting to Earth and then eliminate their leader (codenamed ""Makron"").The game's expands on the 3D game engine used in Quake, featuring additional out-of-the-box support for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics (via OpenGL) and new rendering effects (such as different-colored lighting). The game engine, later known as id Tech 2, also revamps the modularity of the game logic by having it use module DLLs instead of using QuakeC. Along with several fan-made mods, the game's engine was used for several third-party games, including Heretic II, SiN, Kingpin: Life of Crime, Soldier of Fortune, Daikatana, and Anachronox. Its complete source code was later released as open source on December 22 2001 under the GNU General Public License, allowing for expanded source ports.Along with two licensed ""mission packs"" (The Reckoning by Xatrix and Ground Zero by Rogue), the game received two official console ports (a Nintendo 64 version by Raster Productions and a Sony PlayStation version by HammerHead), multiple third-party computer ports (for Mac OS, Linux, and the Amiga), and an obscure port for the Zeebo. Other releases include Quake II Netpack I: Extremities (which include fan-made mods and levels), Quake II: Quad Damage (which include the game, both Mission Packs, and the Netpack), Quake II: Colossus (a Linux compilation including the game and both Mission Packs), and Ultimate Quake (which include the original Quake trilogy). An enhanced port of the game was included in the Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 as a bonus disc. The game, as well as its expansions, were digitally released by id via Steam on August 3, 2007 (albeit without the original soundtrack).The game received an updated PC and Linux port by NVIDIA's Lightspeed Studios on June 6, 2019. Titled Quake II RTX, this version makes extensive use of ray-tracing technology of modern GPUs to add several new graphical effects.The game also received multiple sequels, starting with Quake III Arena. While the direct sequel switches the aesthetic yet again, Quake II's story was expanded in both Quake 4 and the spin-off Enemy Territory: Quake Wars. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Quake II is a fast-paced first-person shooter game similar to it predecessor. Some of the weapons from the original Quake make an appearance in Quake II (Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher) along with many new weapons (Blaster, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Railgun, Hyperblaster, and BFG10K). </div>  <div> Weapons : The single player of Quake II contains nine missions each with one primary objective and several secondary objectives that must be completed in order to complete the primary objective. Along the way there are plenty of weapons to collect and enemies to shoot. The single player focuses on action and contains no puzzles, except for having to press switches to open up new areas, and minimal backtracking.The game does include a few scripted events such as enemies running away from an imminent air strike, but these mostly consist of monster closets. The area for each mission is very large and has several sections, the game loads whenever the player reaches a different section of the area. Sections are identified by two doors in close proximity to each other, the player enters the first door and before entering the second the game loads. In addition, each section has its own separate statistics for secrets, enemies, goals, etc. </div>  <div> Enemies : WeaponDescriptionBlasterThe starting weapon in Quake II. The Blaster has infinite ammo, but has a slow rate of fire and is very weak.ShotgunThe Shotgun fires 12 pellets and does decent damage at close range. Unlike most shotguns, it can be used effectively at medium range but it useless at long ranges.Super ShotgunThe Super Shotgun fires 20 pellets and is significantly stronger than the shotgun, it fires two shells at once.Machine GunThe Machine Gun is a sub-machine gun with a good rate of fire but strong vertical recoil. Fire it in short bursts or maintain the aim until it reaches the top of its climb.Chain GunThe Chain Gun takes a few seconds to warm up but once it starts shooting it has an extremely high rate of fire and will drain the player's ammo supply very quickly. Unlike the machine gun the chain gun has no vertical climb, but is still inaccurate at long range.GrenadeThe Grenade is a simple weapon that can be thrown or used as ammo for the grenade launcher. The grenade can be cooked by holding the fire button.Grenade LauncherThe Grenade Launcher uses grenades as ammo, once fired the grenades take 3 seconds to explode or if they make contact with an enemy they will explode immediately.Rocket LauncherThe Rocket Launcher fires relatively slow moving rockets that have a large radius of splash damage making it a dangerous weapon to use at close range. Jumping while firing at the ground allows the player to rocket jump to out-of-reach areas.RailgunThe Railgun fires a depleted uranium slug at very high speeds. In the hands of an expert, it is one of the best weapons to use in multiplayer due to its accuracy and damage.HyperblasterThe Hyperblaster is an automatic weapon that fires bolts on energy in a circular pattern. The weapon has to spin down after being fired so it can't be fired again for a few seconds.BFG 10KThe BFG 10K is the most powerful weapon in Quake II, and it is a homeage to the famous BFG 9000 from Doom. When fired, it releases a large green energy ball that shoots out green lasers at nearby enemies. It consumes 50 energy cells per shot and can kill most enemies in one hit.Grapple The Grapple is a Capture the Flag only item and can be used to get to areas on the map that would otherwise be inaccessible, it is also very useful to gain high speed very quickly. </div>  <div> Campaign : Enemy (health points)DescriptionLight Guard (20)The Light Guard is the most common and weakest enemy in Quake II. It carries either a Blaster, Shotgun, or Machine Gun and has the lowest amount of health points out of all the enemies in the game. Even in large numbers, the Light Guard posses little threat to the player due to its weak attacks and low health.Barracuda Shark (50)The Barracuda Shark is a rare enemy only found in water and are usually seen travelling in packs.Enforcer (100)The Enforcer is a common enemy in the earlier levels, but in the later levels is much less common. The Enforcer attacks with its chain gun that is attached to his right arm when the player is at a distance. When up close it will attempt to melee the player with his right arm. The Enforcer's low health and slow movements makes it easy to deal with.Berzerker (240)The Berzerker has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to the player and use a melee attack. The player can easily tell if a Berzerker has spotted them because it will shot out ""Trespasser"" when it spots the player. The Berzerker is a quick enemy and its melee attack knocks the player back a long distance or can easily knock the player off of a ledge. However, the attack itself does not do a lot of damage.Gunner (175)The Gunner is a common enemy that has a machine gun on its right arm and a grenade launcher on it left. Despite its relatively low health, the Gunner is one of the deadliest enemies in the game, mostly due to its very powerful grenade launcher. It can fire 4 grenades in quick succession that do massive damage if they directly hit the player.Flyer (50)The Flyer is a small flying robot with low health, it attacks with its blaster cannons at long range and uses its wings to melee the player when up close. They are one of the most annoying enemies in the game because of their small size and the fact that they are flying, which makes them difficult to hit. However, if the player can get them up close a simple shotgun blast will kill them easily.Parasite (175)The Parasite is a four-legged dog-like enemy that attacks by launching a organic tube at the player which drains the players health. The attack is annoying because its almost impossible to dodge and does a lot of damage.Mutant (300)The Mutant is a rare enemy that only appears in two levels. Similar to the Berzerker, it has no range attacks and will only attempt to get up close to melee. It is more dangerous then the Berzerker due to its higher health and more damaging attacks.Brain (300)The Brain is a strange robotic enemy that appears rarely. The Brain has an energy shield on the front that protects it from damage. It has two attacks, an arm hook and releasing tentacles from its chest. Neither attack has a good range and that coupled with its extremely slow speed make it one of the easiest enemies in the game. The only problem is that its energy shield makes it a bullet sponge.Medic (300)The Medic is another rare enemy that attacks using its automatic blaster attached to its right arm. However, attacking is not its main use, the Medic is able to revive any enemy that is not gibbed.Icarus (240)A flying enemy similar to the Flyer except with a lot more health and no melee attack. The Icarus is more of an annoyance than anything, its attack does very little damage and it poses little threat to the player. However, it keeps its distance from the player making it difficult to hit.Technician (200)The technician is a robotic enemy that contains a head encased in liquid. Other than being an incredibly strange enemy, the Technician posses little threat to the player because it is slow and does very little damage.Gladiator (400)The Gladiator is an enemy with high health and a very powerful shoulder mounted Railgun. The Gladiator is one of the most dangerous enemies in the game as its Railgun does a lot of damage and is difficult to dodge and its up close melee attack also does quite a bit of damage as well.Iron Maiden (175)The Iron Maiden is an enemy with a Rocket Launcher attached to its left arm and a claw attached to its right arm that is used for melee. Its Rocket Launcher attack deals heavy damage.Tank (750)The Tank is the strongest normal enemy in Quake II. It is heavily armoured and slow moving and has three main weapons. Its first weapon is a machine gun attached to its right arm which does low damage. Its second weapon is a blaster on its left arm that fires three blasts in a row which deals high damage. Lastly, it has a shoulder mounted Rocket Launcher which fires a stream of rockets and is the Tank's deadliest attack. The Tank is a very powerful enemy and has a lot of health, but if the player can take advantage of its slow speed it is much easier to deal with. Popping in and out of cover to shoot at it with a powerful weapon such as the rocket launcher or BFG10K will keep the player from getting hit by the Tanks deadly attacks. The Tank also has a more powerful variation called the Tank Commander (not to be confused with the boss enemy of the same name). Tank Commanders have the same attacks that do the same amount of damage, the only difference is it has 1000 health points instead of 800. Tank Commanders can only be found in the games final level.Tank Commander (2500)The Tank Commander is a boss enemy that is encountered twice in Quake II. It has tank-like treads to help it move around quickly, and it has two weapons, a chain gun and a rocket launcher. Its chain gun attack is very dangerous because it can kill the player in a mater of seconds and has no start up delay. Its Rocket Launcher attack fires three rockets that do massive damage.Hornet (2000)The Hornet is the second boss enemy, encountered two times (three counting the secret level) in Quake II. It has less health than the Tank Boss, but is harder to hit because it is able to fly. Like the Tank Boss the Hornet has two attacks, a twin chain gun that does the same amount of damage as the Tank Boss' chain gun and a rocket launcher that fires four rockets rather than the three rockets the tank boss fires. The Hornet is a very tough enemy to kill and its chaingun attack is hard to dodge and does a lot of damage.Jorg (3000)The Jorg is an exoskeleton used by the leader of the Strogg, the Makron. It is tied with the Makron himself for the most hit points in the game, and is equipped with twin chain guns. The chain guns deal similar damage to that of the other two bosses, the main difference being the Jorg's chaingun lasts indefinitely while the other bosses chain guns only fire in bursts making the Jorg's chaingun more dangerous. In addition to the chain gun attack, the Makron himself will fire his BFG 10K. This attack is extremely dangerous because the beams that shoot out from a BFG 10K energy shot are extremely hard to dodge and drain the players health and armor very quickly. One BFG 10K shot can kill the player instantly or cripple them if they don't find cover quickly. When Jorg is defeated it will explode and the Makron is left exposed.The Makron (3000)The Makron is the leader of the Strogg and is fought after destroying the Makron's exoskeleton, Jorg. The Makron still has the powerful BFG 10K attack which he uses in the Jorg battle, but he also has two new attacks. The first is a blaster attack that fires 20 blaster shots, the attack does moderate damage but is easily avoided by strafing. The second is a Railgun attack very similar to that of the Gladiator. It can also be dodged by strafing, but is harder to avoid than the blaster attack. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Unlike id's previous first-person shooters, which had players progressing from level to level (with the game sometimes split into multiple ""episodes""), Quake II has the game split into multiple groups of seamless levels. This system allows players to traverse back-and-forth between levels at different points, which is sometimes required to complete objectives. The included campaign is split into the following:The first series of levels is set in a military base, in which players must reach its communication systems and establish a link to the player's command ship.BASE1 - Outer BaseBASE2 - InstallationBASE3 - Comm CenterTRAIN - Lost Station (hidden level)The second series of levels is set in a warehouse, in which players must shut down a vital supply transport.BUNK1 - Ammo DepotWARE1 - Supply StationWARE2 - WarehouseThe third series of levels is set in a security complex, in which players must shut down the computer controlling the region's security grid.JAIL1 - Main GateJAIL2 - Detention CenterJAIL3 - Security ComplexJAIL4 - Torture ChambersJAIL5 - Guard HouseSECURITY - Grid ControlThe fourth series of levels is set in nearby mines, in which players must traverse in order to reach the Strogg production facility.MINTRO - Mine EntranceMINE1 - Upper MinesMINE2 - Bore HoleMINE3 - Drilling AreaMINE4 - Lower MinesThe fifth series of levels is set in the facility that produces new Strogg from the marine's fallen allies. Players must traverse the facility and shut it down.FACT1 - Receiving CenterFACT2 - Processing PlantFACT3 - Sudden Death (hidden level)The sixth series of levels is set in a power plant close to the planetary defense system. Players must disrupt the enemy defenses by overloading its reactor (after shutting down both the coolant and waste disposal systems).POWER1 - Power PlantPOWER2 - The ReactorCOOL1 - Cooling FacilityWASTE1 - Toxic Waste DumpWASTE2 - Pumping Station 1WASTE3 - Pumping Station 2The seventh series of levels is set inside the planetary defense system itself (known as the ""Big Gun""). Players must disable it to allow the TCM to call in an air strike and demolish it.BIGGUN - Big GunThe eighth series of levels is set inside a hangar that controls the Black Hole Generator (which allows interplanetary travel for their invasion). Players must shut down the Strogg fleet, then destroy the Black Hole Generator itself, and then proceed to the Makron's palace.HANGAR1 - Outer HangarHANGAR2 - Inner HangarLAB - Research LabCOMMAND - Launch CommandSTRIKE - OutlandsSPACE - Comm Satellite (hidden level)The ninth series of levels is set inside the Makron's heavily-guarded palace. As they make their way to the Makron, they must disable the communication laser that allows the Makron to communicate with its distant armies.CITY1 - Outer CourtsCITY2 - Lower PalaceCITY3 - Upper PalaceIn the tenth and final series of levels, the players make their way to the Makron's inner sanctum and must pursue the Strogg leader to the final confrontation.BOSS1 - Inner ChamberBOSS2 - Final Showdown </div>  <div> Modifications : Like Doom and Quake, Quake II can be played in networked multiplayer both co-operatively (with players teaming up to take on the main campaign) and competitively (in arenas suited for deathmatches). </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The base game includes eight Deathmatch maps, with additional maps added as separate downloads.Q2DM1 - The EdgeQ2DM2 - Tokay's TowersQ2DM3 - The Frag PipeQ2DM4 - Lost HallwaysQ2DM5 - The PitsQ2DM6 - Lave TombQ2DM7 - The Slimy PlaceQ2DM8 - WareHouseThe studio later released three additional maps that were intended for 64-player servers, all in a single separate download:Base64 - The Strogg BaseCity64 - Courts at WarSewer64 - The Sewers of StroggosIn addition, the following map was released as a separate download:Match1 - Reckless Abandon </div>  <div> System Requirements : The v3.20 patch of Quake II includes the mod Quake II ThreeWave Capture the Flag, which brings the Capture the Flag game mode to Quake II. Based on the ThreeWave Capture mod for the original Quake, CTF is a team-based mode where two teams fight to steal the enemy's flag from their base and bring it back to theirs.The mode includes a bonus utility weapon, known as the Grapple, which serves as a grappling hook that allows new mobility options. It also adds four unique ""tech"" power-ups, which serve as a player upgrade:Power Amplifier - Increased damage.Disruptor Shield - Increased damage resistance.Time Accelerator - Increased movement speed.Auto Doc - Grants health regeneration.Only one Tech power-up can be equipped per player, and can be dropped for other players using a dedicated command.The first included version, known as CTF 1.02, includes the following batch of levels:Q2CTF1 - McKinley RevivalQ2CTF2 - Stronghold OppositionQ2CTF3 - The SmelterQ2CTF4 - OutlandsQ2CTF5 - Capture Showdownid later released three additional maps with the CTF 1.50 patch:Q2CTF6 - Borders CanyonQ2CTF7 - Boxed InQ2CTF8 - The Hangar ScenarioIn addition, the following map was released as a separate download:Q2CTF4a - Outlands II </div>  <div> Playing Quake II on modern systems : Quake II had a very active modding community which spawned a large number of total conversations, maps, player models and more. </div>  <div> External links : Perhaps the most noteworthy of Q2's mod legacy is Action Quake 2 (AQ2) which implemented a realistic setting and modern day weaponry, it also introduced bleeding and the ability to cripple enemies so that they need to bandage themselves.Some AQ2 developers later went on to develop Counter-Strike for Half-Life. </div> "

They will throw grenades, shoot missiles, tank shells, and bullets at you, to try and turn you back to your human form. After taking enough damage from either enemies, or falling off buildings, you will revert back to a small human, and run off to the left of the screen while covering their naked bodies with their hands. The game also added 2 player co-op where players can team up with a friend, to wreak havoc with two monsters. This is George, he is angry, he is an ape.Some of the improvements from the original include semi-3D backgrounds, as well as power ups for your characters.

Players take control of Rayman, a limbless hero whose main attack is shooting his fists and energy balls at his opponents. This is the first Rayman game to be made in 3D. Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers. </div>  <div> Plot : On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs. </div>  <div> Characters : Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience. </div>  <div> Releases : Rayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly.  </div>  <div> Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution) : Globox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special ‘rain-dance’.  </div>  <div> PC Requirements : Following the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game. Murfy can be summoned by the player standing on his corresponding tile.  </div> "

Road Rash 64,Pacific Coast Power & Light,THQ,27-Sep-99,n64,Road Rash 64 is a vehicular combat game in the Road Rash franchise,3030-18864,18864,0,9/22/1999,https://www.giantbomb.com/road-rash-64/3030-18864/,," <div> Overview : Road Rash 64 is the fifth installment in the  Road Rash franchise and the only installment to come out for a  Nintendo home console. It is also the only Road Rash game not developed or published by  Electronic Arts.Keeping the same mantra of previous Road Rash games, races consist of high-speed motorcycles and violent battles among riders.The game was developed by  Pacfic Coast Power & Light, published by  THQ and released on September 22, 1999. The initial development of the game was expected to be a port of  Road Rash 3D from the  Playstation (which had come out a year earlier), but ended up being a much more arcade-like experience focused on the battles between riders (with power-ups and more elaborate weapons) rather than the racing aspect that its Playstation brother was known for. While most reviewers found the gameplay to be highly enjoyable, the game's graphics were commonly regarded as ""poor"". </div>  <div> Gameplay : Going through a variety of locales, the object of the game is to win races and gain money to buy better motorcycles. Central to the racing is vehicular combat, where you can use either weapons or your bike to knock other riders off of their bikes. Weapons can be stolen from the attacker by hitting the attack button with no weapon equipped while being attacked by a rider with a weapon. Being knocked off your bike would result in a few seconds of delay before respawning. While the gameplay is very open and almost all areas are drivable, if you crash while cutting across the map, you will get a message ""Cheaters never prosper"" and are spawned at an undesirable spot of the road.Being hit results on your health bar going down, and losing all health would cause you to fall of your bike. Below that health bar is a bike health bar, crashing too many times will bring this bar down, and once it runs out you fail the race.Police will often chase you during races, at which point you can either knock them off their bikes or ignore them, however they do have powerful nightsticks that they will use to knock you off your bike. If a policeman knocks you off your bike, you are busted and lose the race.Races often have the opposing riders grouped into gangs that will help each other by knocking out other riders. Eventually you join a gang of your own, who do not hit you unless you hit them too often. </div>  <div> Bonus Content : A hidden game mode allows the player to race with scooters. While they may not be fast, it allows you to focus much more attention on attacking the AI, and the slower speed and ridiculous look of the riders on these bikes adds a comedic aspect to the races.The final bike that you can buy is extremely powerful and has a top speed of over 300 miles per hour. These bikes can only be raced on specific track layouts due to their power, listed as ""Insanity"" in the game. Accelerating too quickly will cause you to do a hard wheelie, often causing you to crash. The increased frequency of wrecks on these high-speed bikes typically will cause the player to ""damage out"" substantially faster than in the standard game types. </div> "

Rocket: Robot on Wheels,Sucker Punch Productions,Ubi Soft,31-Oct-99,n64,"Rocket is a robot. He has a wheel that he rolls around on. So really, the title is misleading if you were hoping for more than one wheel.",3030-7804,7804,0,11/17/1999,https://www.giantbomb.com/rocket-robot-on-wheels/3030-7804/,ESRB: E," <div> Premise : Rocket belongs to a man named Dr. Gavin, who despite apparently having a doctorate, has spent his time designing and funding the construction of Whoopie World, a fantastical amusement park. As Gavin attends a party on the eve of the park's opening, Rocket is instructed to watch after the park's mascots. Hijinks ensue as Jojo the raccoon, one of the park's mascots, kidnaps the park's namesake mascot, Whoopie the walrus. Jojo escapes Rocket with a well placed mallet to the head and teleportsdown to the park, with Whoopie as his captive. Rocket gives chase and spends the rest of the game attempting to rescue Whoopie by collecting tickets and tokens while trying to fix the various machines of the park.Like any game that stars a robot in an amusement park, you spend a large portion of your time fighting classic enemies such as: out of control robots, evil robotic clowns, and giant robot bees.  </div>  <div> Rocket's Abilities : At the start of the game, Rocket possesses very little in the way of abilities: only the knowledge of how to jump and how to hold onto objects with a tractor beam. Over the course of the game, Rocket can gain four special moves. Each move can be acquired by collecting a certain number of Tinker Tokens within the various game worlds before seeking out the repair bot Tinker at one of his many repair stations in Whoopie World. These abilities included:   Rocket's tractor beam: One of the game's unique features.Slam Jump (Use to slam/smash objects)   Rocket Jump (Double-Jump) Freeze Ray (Creates ice platforms in water and attacks enemies)   Grapple (Pick up objects at a distance and swing from distant objects)  </div>  <div> Collectibles : Like many 3D platformers on the Nintendo 64, Rocket: Robot on Wheels was designed to include several different collectibles for the player to pick up along the course of the adventure, most of which were necessary for progressing through the game.   Tickets: Like   Super Mario 64's stars,   Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies and   Donkey Kong's golden bananas, tickets can be collected within each of the game's worlds and are used to unlock later areas once enough have been collected. There are 12 tickets contained in each world for a total of 84 in the game, with most tickets attainable within the same trip inside a level if the player persists. Upon pausing the game, the player can select which tickets they are missing from the menu to gain a short clue on the ticket's whereabouts. Tinker Tokens: Similar to the   coins of Super Mario 64 or   notes of Banjo-Kazooie, there are a total of 200 Tinker Tokens to be collected within each level. Collect all 200 and the player gains a Ticket, although the secondary and perhaps more important use of the tokens is within the game's hub world, where they can be used to pay for new abilities and upgrades for Rocket. There are three varieties of Tinker Token - silver, gold and purple which earn you one, five and ten tokens respectively, in similar fashion to the different colored coins in Super Mario 64. Machine Parts: Collect each part within a world and return it to the machine's control panel to activate a machine. This gives Rocket a ticket and access to a new area that likely contains another ticket.  Booster Packs: These come in the form of a large, golden atom and are like the   extra honeycomb pieces in Banjo-Kazooie.  There are two in Whoopie World and one in all other levels. Picking one up will extend your health by one unit immediately.  </div>  <div> Vehicles : One of Rocket's more unique additions is that of its vehicles. The player can use these contraptions to travel or solve puzzles. Each vehicle requires a certain number of Tinker Tokens to operate, and excluding Whoopie World, each world has at least one vehicle.    Dune Dog - The first vehicle of the game, located in Clowny Island. Requires 50 Tinker Tokens to operate. A   hot dog car which can be used to race around the island in high speed. Hoversplat - The first vehicle available in Paint Misbehavin'. Requires 125 Tinker Tokens. The Hoversplat hovers around the world and uses its   cannon to fire blobs of different colored paint at various objects. Finbot - The second vehicle of Paint Misbehavin'. Requires 175 Tokens. The dolphin-shaped Finbot allows Rocket to swim through water at top speeds. Beamlift - A strange monster truck shaped contraption used in Mine Blowing. Requires 325 Tokens. The Beamlift is equipped with more powerful version of Rocket's tractor beam, able to lift and shift large crates. No, the Shag Flyer does not help you pick up chicks.Shag Flyer - A   magic carpet with a vase on top for Rocket to sit in, found at the start of Arabian Flights. Requires 475 Tokens. The Shag Flyer can fly through the world, and use is practically mandatory to get anything done. Glider Bike - A motorcycle with retractable bat wings found in Pyramid Scheme. Requires 750 Tokens. The Glider Bike is arguably the most difficult vehicle to control in the game. Spider Rider - A spider-like boat found in Food Fright. Requires 850 Tokens. A spider vehicle with the ability to crawl over the top of extremely harmful liquids.  </div>  <div> Worlds :  Welcome to Clowny Island!Rocket is a smaller platformer than most of those on the Nintendo 64, as evidenced by the 84 tickets to collect and the presence of only seven worlds to traverse, including the   overworld. However, most of the worlds shy away from the typical forest, lava and ice worlds typical of most platformers of the day in favor of more novel themes. These worlds also manage to keep true to the theme of the Whoopie World theme park, in that each world is actually just a smaller portion of a Disney World-like-place. Throughout the game Rocket will go behind the basic exterior of each world, showcasing the mechanical gizmos that keep everything together as an attraction. The levels include:   Whoopie World - Hub world where the rest of the levels can be accessed from, appears similar in appearance to a circus.  Clowny Island - A small island containing a few sideshow attractions and a   roller coaster. Based off the famous Coney Island amusement park.  Paint Misbehavin' - A world with Roman-themed architecture, as well a recurring theme of painting things different colors. Mine Blowing - A mine with bombable walls housing secret passageways and a minecart ride. Arabian Flights - An Arabian-themed city high above the clouds, where one uses a magic carpet vehicle to travel from place to place. Pyramid Scheme - An Aztec pyramid situated in the middle of forests and lava; Jojo has created a mirror world of lava and ash to the world's lush jungle. Food Fright - A world based completely around junk food, specifically sweets such as marshmallows, candy canes,   chocolate and   ice cream.     </div>  <div> Awards : Nintendo Power awarded Rocket: Robot on Wheels the title: ""18th Greatest Nintendo 64 Game of All Time."" </div> "

The beginning of the instruction booklet to the original game contains the following text, explaining the backstory.""It's the dawn of a new century, mankind has succeeded in maintaining peace and has prospered like never before. However, from this newfound prosperity has come a population explosion. This increase in mouths to feed has caused a strain on the food supplies of the world. Shortages of food became critical in all regions of the world. Mankind needed a new food source, one that could breed even under the most abnormal conditions; and so scientists began creating a ""New Species"" of life. After some time, the scientists succeeded in creating this ""New Species"" of life, and Hokkaido (The north-most Japanese Island) was chosen as the huge nesting pasture. The humans who succeeded in obtaining the new source of food expected their new found prosperity to continue again.However...From the midst of the ""New Species"" came mutated beasts which suddenly began to devour their human hunters. The attacking hoards which formed a loose group henceforth became know as ""Ruffians"", they travelled south through the Japanese Islands and gained control over all of north-east Japan. In Tokyo the Ruffian began invading in front of the very eyes of the city's inhabitants, large-scale riots of confused citizens occurred frequently. This situation led to dispatch of an international peace organization called the ""Armed Volunteers"", but they began to use their military force to suppress the people of Japan.As expected, the future of Japan has become again... bleak. And possibly so has the future of humanity. On the other hand, a mysterious rumour began to circulate among the people of Tokyo, where the battle for the survival of mankind is being lost day by day.The rumour...The arrival and appearance of an organization of citizens which call themselves the ""Saviour Group""...The ""Saviour Group"" were formed from a group of people who recovered from illness, injury & sorrow due to the miracles of a mysterious holy woman called ""Achi"". The ""Savour Group"" is a self-defense organization of Japanese citizens who support themselves by hunting Ruffian, they oppose the Armed Volunteers who they consider hypocritical masses.Exhausted and wounded people began to gather to the holy woman Achi one after another, and ask for ""salvation"".However, her ""salvation"" was not without a price. In compensation the healed must ""fight"" in the name of the holy woman. Many weak people became involved in many unnecessary disputes, and began following a path to despair...""  The main character prepares for battle.So, to summarize this up, there is a 3-way war going on throughout Japan. The Japanese rebels, the Relief Group. The private US military force, Armed Volunteers. And genetically mutated animals that prey on humanity, the Ruffians. At the start of the game, the Armed Volunteers have exterminated all but three remaining rebels (Saki, Airan, and Achi), the Ruffians are preparing to launch an invasion on Tokyo, and the remaining Relief Group must reach the Shinjuku station to take a transport out of Japan. It seems to go smoothly for Saki and co, and after killing the gigantic ruffian, Radan, an Armed Volunteers officer by the name of Kachyua mourns the destruction of ""her research materials"", and attempts to kill Saki. After Saki, supposedly, defeats Kachyua, Tokyo becomes flooded by a mysterious red liquid (possibly blood of some sort), and Saki is transformed into a gigantic Ruffian beast, and fights a now transformed Kachyua in one last battle. Saki, all filled with rage, destroys the transport vessel containing Airan and Achi, but the holy woman escapes with Airan via teleportation, and Tokyo is left in ruins.Meanwhile, off the coast of Japan, the Armed Volunteers Officer, known only as Brad, is grieved over the death of another general and close friend, Kachyua. Realizing the beast Saki has become, he vows to destroy him, and prove how more superior he is to Achi. The holy woman and Airan arrive intact aboard the Armed Volunteers flagship, and Airan fights her way to the bridge to fight Brad, to avenge her friends. The battle that follows continues into an aerial assault on the fleet, thanks to Achi's powers, and Brad is defeated, along with the Armed Volunteers morale. Brad uses his powers to commit suicide ""in a final bit of justice,"" and a giant gunship is summoned, that fires a warhead at Saki.  The characters converse during a cutscene between levels.The warhead is intercepted thanks to Airan and Achi's efforts, and the holy woman explains to Airan how they can help Saki return to his human form. Airan refuses to do so, as inorder to change Saki back to normal, she needs to shoot Saki to render him unconsious. As her mind conflicts, Airan finds her self with a young five year old boy on a subway train on Long Island. Airan fights her way through the train, and discovers that she is ten years in the future, and that Saki has sided with the ruffians. Airan realizes that she is in Achi's vision, of a future where Saki and Airan have son, by the name of Issa Amamiya, and that Saki has chosen to fight alongside the ruffians. Airan proceeds to shoot Saki, but realizes that her action affected Saki for real, and blames Achi for ""using a child.""As Achi proceeds to revert Saki from his current state of being, she reveals her actual intentions. She claims her real enemies to be ""very far away"", and that she plans to use Saki as her weapon against the enemy, while not planning to save humanity or the earth in the process. Brad was actually the first person Achi had approached to use as her weapon, but after realizing the powers he had been given through Achi's blood, he became responsible for the creation of the Ruffians, and became responsible for the events mentioned in the backstory. After enfusing Airan within Saki's body, Saki regains his consiousness and teleports out of Achi's reach, to Hokaido. Airan wakes up on the shores, and finds Saki defending her against the oncoming Ruffians, except, half-human. Both Saki and Airan race to find shelter and discuss their next plan of action. Airan suggests them heading to America, so they could find a doctor to help treat Saki's condition. A noise is heard outside, and Saki proceeds to investigate, leaving Airan vulnerable to capture by Achi. Saki returns to find her missing, and sets out to retrieve her, and confronts Achi after fight through a wave of Ruffians. Saki learns that his condition is caused by his feelings for Airan, that half of his heart is refusing her.  Fighting an enemy head on.Saki is enraged with what Achi has attempted to use him for, and attempts to shoot her, though his cannon sword proves ineffective. Saki unleashes an energy punch with Achi's guard down, and Achi recovers from the attack and shoots into the atmosphere. Saki wakes up Airan, and asks her to ""hold on to his heart,"" and Saki returns to his gigantic ruffian form and gives chase to Achi. The woman creates an earth mimicry to replace the current planet, and Saki uses all his power to destroy the mimicry before the real earth is destroyed. Saki is successful, but as Achi is defeated, she leaves the following message:""The old earth die soon...killed by the very people it fed...""The two return to earth, and Airan looks out to sea, calling Japan a ""mess."" Saki tells her about how he wanted to be a cop, and suggests that they go ahead and take on the rest of the ruffians. Meanwhile, in space, Achi ponders to herself about what she will do, now that ""the enemy"" is coming. But, realizing that Saki has inherited her blood, along with future generations from him, she realizes that a ""new form of life"" is establishing itself on ""that planet,"" and now knows that her enemies will soon come to an end. Back on earth, Saki and Airan make they're journey to Honshu, and the two talk about the situation before them, and Saki's newfound powers. As the game credits end, Saki hints that they have another important mission ahead of them, saying that many preparations will have to be made.""Just think. 10 years from now, it'll be five years old. Our child...""Controls  The game's tutorial level allows you to get adjusted to the controls.The game is overall a railshooter, but the controls are very interesting. Using the control stick to aim, depending on what you're dominant hand is, you use either the D-Pad or the Left and Right C-buttons to make Saki (or Airan) strafe. Tapping it twice will do an evasive roll. The L or R button can be used for jumps, and the Z button is shoot, or when enemies and objects are in close proximity, sword. Pressing the A button will switch the targeting reticule between ""manual"" and ""lock-on"". Lock-on does what you'd think, by sticking to the enemies, but it does less damage than manual aiming. Another interesting aspect is the co-op. The game says that it supports up to two players. It does this, letting one player control the character's movements, while the other controls the aiming. It's a unique form of co-op, and it is somewhat like Super Mario Galaxy's co-op. </div>  <div> Reception and Legacy  :   This game encouraged the popular practice of gamers importing titles from other countries to play unlocalized games.While the original game in 2000 wasn't released outside of Japan, as was originally intended, it did not stop importers from getting the game. Sites that had imported the game had given the game positive reviews, and had guessed of the probability of the game coming to the Wii Virtual Console, back when it was first revealed at E3 2005. On the first week of October 2007, the Virtual Console had it's first two games originally from Japan available for download, with Sin & Punishment as one of them. The reception remained positive. One year later, at the Nintendo Media Summit, it was announced that a sequel, aptly titled Sin & Punishment 2, would be coming to the Wii in 2009. Nintendo said that both Treasure and Nintendo noticed how good the sales of the game on the VC were, and after some discussion, the sequel was created. The game would also be release worldwide, instead of Japan only like the first game.Also, shortly after the release of the first game on the Virtual Console, an update on the Smash Bros DOJO revealed that Saki would make an appearance as one of the game's assist trophies. When summoned, he would jump and run around the stage, shooting and slashing at foes with his cannon sword. </div> "

Space Invaders,Z-Axis,TaitoActivision,30-Nov-99,n64,"Space Invaders, released in arcades by Taito in 1978, is one of the most influential and successful video games of all time, laying the foundations for most shooters and action games that followed. It revolutionized the game industry and has become a pop culture icon.",3030-5099,5099,0,6/19/1978,https://www.giantbomb.com/space-invaders/3030-5099/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game’s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) versionGameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player’s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their “invasion.” As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or “bunkers” near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a “mystery ship” will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus. </div>  <div> Development : While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinetDue to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game’s original title, Space Monsters. </div>  <div> Impact and Legacy : Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins—and subsequent production increase—in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 versionThe 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first ""killer app"" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as ""the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time."" Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the ""Top 10 Most Influential Games"" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of ""The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,"" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which ""were attempts to simulate already-existing things,"" Space Invaders was ""the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else."" In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a “high score,” and was the first to save the player’s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari’s Asteroids, Williams’ Defender, and Namco’s Galaxian series.It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a ""seminal arcade classic"", IGN listed it as the number eight ""classic shoot 'em up"". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry. </div> "

Later installments in the Star Fox franchise would implement Star Fox 2's mechanical and story elements as their own.",3030-21650,21650,0,9/29/2017,https://www.giantbomb.com/star-fox-2/3030-21650/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : After the success that was Star Fox, Nintendo continued to do research and development on the Super FX micro chip technology that was created in 1993 to make a game like Star Fox possible. Games like Vortex and even Stunt Race FX saw an improved version of the Super FX chip, but there was never a drastic change in the technology.That was the case until Nintendo developed the Super FX 2 chip, capable of rendering approximately 1000 polygons per second over a considerable draw distance. This technology would be used on Star Fox 2, a game which never actually saw the light of day. The game was canceled due to the upcoming release of the Nintendo 64, according to Dylan Cuthbert, one of the game's programmers.Features originating in Star Fox 2 were later implemented in future games in the Star Fox franchise. The new aiming mode, which gave players complete control over where a shot was being fired, was included as ""all-range mode"" in Star Fox 64, while the strategy features of the game can be found in Star Fox Command.On September 29th, 2017, Star Fox 2 was finally officially released as a part of the SNES Classic Edition. </div>  <div> Story : After Andross' defeat on the planet of Venom he managed to escape with his life. Though the Lylat System is in a state of peace, it will not last for long. Andross, bitter from his miserable defeat, toils to create a new invasion army. An army of fighters, carriers, bio-genetically engineered creatures, and team made up of four mercenary pilots. Andross wastes no time in rallying his invasion army and waging total war on every world of the Lylat system. Planet after planet falls under Andross' control until Corneria is the one world yet to be conquered. Just when all hope seems to be lost, the Cornerians fight back with Fox McCloud and the Star Fox team at the forefront of it all. With new ships, weapons, and allies, the ultimate fight for Corneria and all of the Lylat System begins! </div>  <div> Gameplay : Star Fox 2's gameplay is similar in style to its predecessor, with several refinements and changes. Aside from having three different difficulty modes that have a steady graduation of difficulty, the game has a non-linear style of play that allows players to tackle certain missions out of order. Another change that stands as huge departure from the structure of Star Fox is the combination of multiple genres of game styles.Star Fox 2, at its core, is a 3D space shooter as well as a real-time strategy game. To navigate from one mission to another the player must guide their ships to a mission area which could be anything from a cluster of fighters, missiles, or carriers to oppressed planets and so on and so forth. There are many boss fights in Star Fox 2, but they don't necessarily happen at the end of a level like other common conventions would dictate. The boss fights count as totally separate missions that chase down the player's ship on the map.Another aspect introduced in Star Fox 2 is the real-time clock system. Before the player makes a choice on where to move (done by moving a cursor about the system map), time stands still. However, if the player is moving or is currently in a mission, the clock starts ticking. While the player is in the heat of battle anything can happen on the world map and to Corneria. When the game is paused a small version of the map shows on the screen and updates itself dynamically to give the player a chance to see if Corneria is in immediate danger or not. There may be occurrences where Corneria will be attacked by one of Andross' forces. When that happens Corneria will accumulate damage shown as a percentage. If that percentage reaches 100%, then Andross succeeds in conquering Corneria and the game ends.This game introduces a new aiming format, which would later be adapted to Star Fox 64 as ""all-range mode,"" allowing the player full control of the shop (instead of an on-rails approach). There are three types of attacks consisting of the wing blasters, special weapons, and the homing charged shot. The player is able to, while holding the fire button down, lock onto an enemy and unleash a charged laser shot at it to inflict a significant amount of damage. Managing boost is no longer in issue in the final test beta of Star Fox 2, but barrel rolls are still an essential mechanic for deflecting enemy fire.Star Fox 2 adds two new characters, as well as the concept of pilots using different ship types (as opposed to solely Arwings in the first game). Miyu, a lynx, and Fay, a poodle, both join the Star Fox team and both make up the Light Fighter class, which boasts a higher speed stat, but has lower shields and meager fire power. Peppy Hare and Slippy Toad return as the pilots of the Heavy Bomber class, which has the most fire power and the heaviest shields, but is slower and has low maneuverability. Fox McCloud and Falco Lombardi are the pilots of the Arwing Fighter class that is the default average-in-all-areas craft. The Great Fox, a high capacity fighter carrier, houses these ships and has a tremendous amount of firepower, but cannot be piloted by the player.While on a mission in which the player is fighting to liberate a planet, the player may encounter some parts that require the Arwing (or ship of choice) to be transformed into a mech walker. The mech walker is capable of traversing the mission at the player’s own pace and has an aiming assistance feature. </div>  <div> Prerelease Versions : There exist two known prerelease versions of Star Fox 2 in a readily available format. These are both playable in both an emulated format, as well as on actual Super Nintendo hardware.The first prerelease version is an alpha version, known for its two player competitive multiplayer. In the multiplayer mode, both players can choose one of several characters, as well as a level, and then face off.The second and more complete version is considered to be in the late beta stage. It is largely a complete game, containing minor bugs, debug menus, several unfinished features, and the removal of the multiplayer mode found in the alpha version. The game has since been touched up by fans, removing the glitches, debug menus, unfinished features, and translating Japanese text into English, rendering the game completely playable from beginning to end. </div> "

It was later ported to the Dreamcast in North America (on April 4, 2000) and Europe (on August 4, 2000).A video game tie-in with the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Racer has players controlling pilots of ""Podracers"": unique anti-gravity racing vehicles consisting of a small cockpit connected to two massive motors. As one of over 20 different racers (each with their own unique Podracer), players participate in numerous tournaments throughout the galaxy in the Galactic Podracing Circuit.It received two sequels: the arcade-based Star Wars: Racer Arcade and the console-based Star Wars: Racer Revenge. Podracing was also a mini-game in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic series. The game also received a handheld adaptation by Pax Softnica for the Game Boy Color on December 6, 1999. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Note: While the characters are given individual backstories which show some to be inexperienced or unmotivated to seek victory, the game treats them all as dedicated and talented racers.Anakin SkywalkerA hero from the film which the game is based on. Anakin is a young human, notable for being the only of his race capable of participating in the dangerous game of podracing.SebulbaSebulba, a Dug, is a popular and successful racer who worked his way to the top by cheating. He is the only racer in the game to have a weapon. When using Sebulba's taunt, a flamethrower spouts out sideways.Bozzie BarantaOnce a mechanic for Gasgano, Bozzie chose to become a racer. He was fairly successful in this venture.Aldar BeedoWhile Aldar Beedo is a talented racer, his first priority is his work as a hitman, taking out racers to pave the way to victory for whoever pays for his services.Toy DampnerDampner is a menacing pilot. While he is known to race elsewhere, he prefers the tracks of Oovo IV, where he is a crowd favorite.Dud BoltA racer hired by Sebulba who is paid per race based on how many competing pods he is able to take out.GasganoAn experienced and talented racer who does not hesitate to take out racers who get in his way.Mars GuoA loudmouth braggart with a fondness for gambling and drinking. While he is a competent racer, his tendency to anger other racers often leads to his downfall.Ebe EndocottOnce a daredevil delivery man, Endocott was encouraged by his boss to take up podracing, where his daredevil ways and piloting skills let him achieve some success.Cy YungaA talented racer with an advanced pod. Yunga is only available in-game through a cheat code, causing him to replace ""Bullseye"" Navior.Ratts TyerellRatts Tyerell is a racer who gained success for his swift reflexes. He owns one of the largest podracers in the circuit.Fud SangA somewhat mediocre and unknown racer, who nevertheless is paranoid of being sabotaged by his opponents.Boles RoorA podracer who also excels at singing, Roor pilots an outdated podracer that nevertheless boasts a high top speed.Ark ""Bumpy"" RooseRoose is a particularly dim-witted pilot who is known for indiscriminately ramming into opposing racers.Wan SandageSandage is a podracer who gained a great deal of fame on his homeworld of Ord Radama. However, he is less successful on other planets, where he suffers from disorientation.Jinn ReesoLittle is known about Jinn Reeso.

This makes the cockpit the frontmost part of the pod, greatly increasing the risk of death in a crash.Elan MakElan Mak is actually a bounty hunter named Kam Nale. He joined the podracing circuit in order to hunt down Aldar Beedo. When he discovered his talent for the sport, he became involved with it beyond his initial intention to only use it as a front to catch Beedo.Clegg Holdfast A reporter for Podracing Quarterly, Holdfast participates in races primarily in order to get an inside scoop. Despite his ulterior motives, he showed himself to be a talented racer. </div>  <div> Characters : TatooineOnly two of the game's courses are found in Tatooine. The first is the Boonta Training Course, an easy map that acquaints players with the game. The second is the Boonta Classic, which is a relatively faithful recreation of the racetrack from the movie.Mon GazzaMon Gazza is a Mars-like world with vast red deserts, crowded but small cities, and lava pits. Tracks here often involve large open spaces that quickly turn to narrow corridors.Ando PrimeAndo Prime is an ice world. Tracks here take players through numerous caves, and often take them across slick, icy surfaces. Many tracks in this world feature a shortcut that opens up in laps 2 and on, in which the racer may turn left immediately past the finish line and enter a tent that hides a tunnel.AquilarisAquilaris is composed largely of water, and its tracks take place largely in the infrastructure built on the water. Players are taken through underwater tunnels through which massive fish may be seen.MalastareMalastare is a dark world with many sharp turns and visual obstructions such as gas and rocky pillars. Tracks here are narrow and unforgiving.BaroondaBaroonda is a jungle world. Players race through a variety of environments here, including thick rain forests, beaches, and a volcano.Ord IbannaRacetracks on Ord Ibanna are all located on infrastructure floating in a cloudy sky. These tracks often feature elevated shortcuts that are difficult to stay on because they are narrow.Oovo IVOovo IV is a large, asteroid-like world. Players race through open expanses along with urban areas. The highest speeds achievable in the game are found here in anti-gravity tunnels. </div>  <div> Planets : There are several tracks on each of the available planets, and every racer has at least one signature track.

Star Wars: Rogue Squadron,Factor 5LucasArts,LucasArtsNA/JPNintendoPAL,7-Dec-98,n64,"Take to the skies with the Rebellion's finest fliers, the legendary Rogue Squadron, and complete all manner of aerial combat missions in the fight against the deadly Empire.",3030-4011,4011,0,12/3/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-rogue-squadron/3030-4011/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Released on December 17 1998, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is the first in a series of space combat games for Nintendo platforms. Originally released on the Nintendo 64 and PC, the game was developed by Factor 5 and was published by LucasArts.Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to make use of the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which updated the graphics and allowed players to play the game in high resolution. Rogue Squadron has spawned two sequels since it's release in 1998, the first being Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader released in September of 2001 for the Nintendo Gamecube and the second being Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike released in October in 2003 for the Gamecube.The game is known for its arcade style approach to starship dogfights, with Factor 5 taking influence from the original Star Wars cockpit arcade game. The game also has little resemblance to the novels for which the series is based, opting for Luke Skywalker to be the main character, rather than Wedge Antilles , the protagonist of the novels. The game also features full voice audio for character dialogue, a rarity for the Nintendo 64 at the time. </div>  <div> Characters : The Millennium Falcon flying over Mos Eisley.Luke, as mentioned, is the main character of Rogue Squadron, the only other playable character being Wedge during a bonus mission of the game. Hobbie and Janson also make an appearance as pilots for the Rebellion, as seen in The Empire Strikes Back. Crix Madine, a Rebel Alliance General by the time of Return of the Jedi, also plays a part in the game, as the player must assist his defection from the Galactic Empire. This incident occurs on Corellia, Han Solo's homeworld, and as expected, the space pirate makes a last minute appearance to help his friend Luke, similar to the end of A New Hope.Wedge plays a pivotal role as well, often being Luke's wing man, and keeping him updated on any threats or mission updates. General Rieekan, from Empire, serves as the commanding Rebel in constant communication with the flight team. He gives orders to Rogue Squadron, and often calls them back to base if the player fails the mission. Another important defection from the Imperials occurs during the course of Rogue Squdron. Kasan Moor, a pilot in the deadly 128th Imperial Squadron, acts upon her doubts of the Empire, eventually becoming a valuable aide to the Rebel cause. Her knowledge of hidden Imperial bases helps Rogue Squadron carry out several sabotage missions, crippling the Empire's forces. It is also hinted that Luke and Kasan are fond of each other, as Kasan is grateful for escaping Imperial influence, and Luke is able to see the good in her. The main adversary of the game is Moff Seerdon, bearing all of the characteristics of a typical evil Imperial officer. He gives commands to the Imperial Fighters, and spouts Imperial rhetoric reminiscent of the films to the opposing Rebels.Characters are not individually seen on screen, apart from their biographies in the game's menu. Rather, the game portrays its characters through the ships and vehicles that each one flies. Moff Seerdon is nearly always represented by a Tyderium Shuttle, and Kasan's defection is visualized in the transition from piloting a TIE Interceptor to an X-Wing. General Rieekan often rides in larger transport crafts, and Luke occupies the starfighter in the player's control. </div>  <div> Story :  Wedge Antilles Chewbacca  Han Solo Wes JansonDerek ""Hobbie"" KlivianCrix Madine Kasan Moor Dak RalterCarlist RieekanZev SenescaKohl Seerdon Luke Skywalker </div>  <div> Locations : An X-Wing, piloted by Luke Skywalker, escorts a supply group on the forested planet of Barkesh.The story of Rogue Squadron takes place between Episode IV and Episode V.The Rebellion is still making an effort to stay united, and resist Imperial takeover, while at the same time engaging in rescue and liberation missions.As the Rogue Squadron help General Madine and Kasan defect, Wedge is caught in his downed Y-Wing by Imperial forces on a mission from which the Rebels are forced to flee. Luke and Kasan launch a rescue attempt, allowing the Rebels to infiltrate the prisons of Kessel and free dozens of war prisoners.Moff Seerdon poses a threat to the recent Rebel successes, with each following Imperial defeat striking anger in the evil commander. Sederdon is finally defeated during his raid on civilian bacta facilities, where Luke and the rest of Rogue Squadron protect the innocent inhabitants and successfully take down Seerdon's shuttle. </div>  <div> Vehicles : The view from inside an X-Wing Fighter cockpit.Many of the locations in Rogue Squadron appear to be counterparts to the Original Trilogy's many planets. Each planet also consists of a single environment, as in all desert, all forest, or mostly water. For example, Barkesh shares many traits with Yavin IV, the Rebel base in A New Hope.Both planets are covered in jungle, and share similar ancient architecture. Talloran is a gas planet, with a floating city that looks very similar to Cloud City, and in fact Kasan comments on how she is reminded by Bespin during the mission.Fest is an all ice world, with Imperial Walkers as the empire's main force, echoing the planet Hoth from Empire. Chandrilla also borrows its architecture heavily from conceptual paintings of Alderaan, a planet unseen on film until 2005 in Revenge of the Sith. Hoth and Beggar's Canyon on Tatooine make appearances as bonus levels, as well as the Death Star's equatorial trench. </div>  <div> Medals & Cheats : A group of Snowspeeders preparing to make an air-to-ground assault. Most of the Rebel and Imperial starfighters in the game remain true to their Star Wars canon traits. For example, the X-Wing is able to shift between attack position and cruise position by locking the S-Foils. The A-Wing is the fastest ship in the fleet, yet also the weakest in terms of shielding, as witnessed in Return of the Jedi; both attributes are similar to the TIE Interceptor, as also seen in Jedi. Used primarily for bombing and escort missions, the rock-solid Y-Wing sees plenty of use in both offensive and defensive missions; the ship's built in Ion Cannons are particularly helpful for disabling important enemy targets. Often employed on air-to-ground missions and quick assaults, the Snowspeeder is a useful craft for dealing with the formidable AT-AT walkers, as seen in The Empire Strikes Back. An expanded universe ship, the V-Wing makes an appearance as a flyable starfighter during the bonus mission featuring Wedge.Rogue Squadron features atmospheric battles only, as true space combat was not introduced until the following Factor 5 game,Battle for Naboo. </div> "
Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire,LucasArts,Nintendo,2-Dec-96,n64,One of the earliest Nintendo 64 action games puts players into the role of mercenary Dash Rendar in this hybrid third-person shooter and flight combat game based on the Star Wars expanded universe project of the same name.,3030-12139,12139,0,12/3/1996,https://www.giantbomb.com/star-wars-shadows-of-the-empire/3030-12139/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview :  Dash Rendar, the game's protagonist.Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire is a hybrid third-person shooter and flight combat game developed and published by  LucasArts for the  Nintendo 64 (on December 3, 1996) and  PC (on September 17, 1997).Part of the Star Wars expanded universe multimedia project of the same name (which also consisted of an original novel, comic books, a soundtrack, and toys), players control mercenary  Dash Rendar as he participates in the Battle of  Hoth (during the events of  Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back), attempts to rescue the frozen  Han Solo from  Boba Fett, recovers secret Imperial plans for the second Death Star (with help from  Luke Skywalker), and rescues  Princess Leia from the game's antagonist (and head of the Black Sun crime syndicate)  Prince Xizor.The game is the first Star Wars game released for the Nintendo 64 (and was released shortly after the console's release). The PC version, released a year later, replaced the use of still images for cutscenes with rendered animated cutscenes (and voiceovers). The game features an orchestral soundtrack, using both  John Williams's iconic themes from the original trilogy and themes from the officially licensed soundtrack (created by composer  Joel McNeely). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire tackles many different forms of gameplay. These include third-person shooter/platforming levels, maintaining turrets on his ship (the Outrider) in an  on-rails sequence, and total-control vehicle levels. Only the final level switches between different forms of gameplay mid-game. </div>  <div> Levels : In most levels, the player controls Dash Rendar himself, running around and gunning stormtroppers, droids, and other enemies. The player can choose between third-person and limited first-person views. Dash uses a variety of weapons (though primarily his Laser Blaster, which has infinite ammo), including seeker missiles, flamethrowers, pulse cannons, stunners, and disruptors. In later levels, Dash obtains a rechargable  jetpack, which helps him fly over difficult platforming areas.The Shooter/Platforming levels and the Swoop Bike level contain ""challenge points"" which are scattered throughout the level, seen in the form of a rotating chrome  Rebel Alliance emblem. These are often put in hard-to-reach areas, encouraging the player to explore the vast levels. Collecting all of them in certain difficulty levels will allow certain codes and privileges to be triggered, including gaining all weapons and invincibility, changing to an  X-Wing or  TIE Fighter in the final level, and allowing  wampas to fight on the player's side in the second level. </div> "
StarCraft,Blizzard EntertainmentMass Media Games,Nintendo,12-Jun-00,n64,"StarCraft has been called the greatest real-time strategy game ever and it's certainly one of the most critically acclaimed. StarCraft features three powerful, yet balanced races: the Terrans, the Zerg, and the Protoss. You play as each race fights to the death for the fate of the universe.",3030-13062,13062,0,4/1/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/starcraft/3030-13062/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : StarCraft is an influential real-time strategy game released by Blizzard Entertainment on March 31st, 1998. The game is set in a unique science-fiction background and includes three playable races: the Terrans, which are the equivalent of humans; the Zerg, an insect-like race; and the Protoss, a technologically advanced humanoid race.The game has been successful worldwide, selling over 11 million copies. The game is especially popular in South Korea, where professional leagues featuring elite players were followed by hundreds or even thousands of spectators. StarCraft, along with its Brood War expansion, is renowned for its brilliant class balance and continued support even over 10 years after its original release.StarCraft Remastered is an upcoming version of the game which will feature upgraded visuals, audio, dialogue and is designed for 4K displays. It will be fully compatible with the original game, which in turn will be made free-to-play with the upcoming 1.18 patch. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Both the original release and the expansion pack, StarCraft: Brood War, feature three full campaigns, one for each race. Unlike many other RTS games, StarCraft places a very heavy focus on massing large armies of units. Although micromanagement is crucial to defeating advanced players, it is not as central to the game play as in games such as the Dawn of War series. Resource management is vital to success, however players are only given two resources to manage: minerals and Vespene gas. Minerals are used to buy units and are used heavily throughout the game, while Vespene gas is often used for the research of more advanced units in the later stages of a match.The reason that StarCraft is still played over 10 years later is because of its extraordinary unit balance. Each unit for each race has a legitimate counter, and there is no strategy that is guaranteed to make a player victorious time after time. Only by truly out thinking one's opponent will one emerge victorious. Of course, professional players and online veterans have developed advanced strategies after many years of practice, so the game continues to evolve and change.The early game forces players to focus on setting up a base, laying out a defensive network, building units quickly, and securing reserves of minerals and Vespene gas. The Zerg units can be built the most quickly, causing Zerg players to often rush an opponent in a move known as the "" Zergling rush."" After the first few minutes of gameplay, the Protoss gain the advantage with their powerful Zealot units which can devastate buildings and basic units. Finally, the Terrans gain the upper hand, with the quickest access to middle-end units such as Siege tanks and Vultures.The middle game focuses on resource management and expansion. The Terrans arguably have the strongest middle game since their buildings are mobile and their units are not prohibitively expensive. The Protoss and Zerg both have a slight lull between their initial tier of units and their advanced units.The late game favours the player that has managed the early and middle game the most efficiently. The Zerg and the Protoss are arguably the best late game races due to their very powerful units. While the Terrans do have Battlecruisers, they are no match for a fleet of fully upgraded Protoss Carriers. In fact, a properly managed group of 12 Protoss carriers with minimal backup (some distracting units and detector units) can often decimate an entire battlefield of bases.A typical match lasts between 20 and 90 minutes, with the ideal number of players being between 2 and 4. Larger games of 6 to 8 players are exciting with team play or when all players are of a similar skill level. Of course, some matches will last only 5 minutes if a player is effective at rushing and another player is not mindful of setting up a defensive network. Matches can last several hours if all players are very low on resources, very rich, have few attacking units, or have heavy defensive networks. The vast majority of matches end up in a single victorious party, but between 5 and 10% of matches will end in a mutually agreed upon draw. </div>  <div> Races : Terran Marines.The Terrans are a colony of humans and use fairly standard units and tactics in terms of RTS games. Terrans are generally considered to be the most defensive race in the game, as they possess many assets which can make their bases especially difficult to penetrate. Bunkers can be filled with up to four basic ground units and may be quickly repaired by their worker units. They offer excellent base defense, particularly when backed up by Siege Tanks. Siege Tanks, while unable to attack air units, have the longest attack range in the game and deal massive damage to ground forces. Many Terran structures also have the ability to fly and relocate, although they move rather slowly.Terrans also have many methods of cloak detection and also tend to be the most micromanagement intensive race when it comes to combat. Even their most basic units, Marines and Firebats, have a researchable activated ability Stim Pack which heals units makes them considerably more effective in combat if used at the right time. Other notable units include the Goliath (a superb ground-to-air specialist that also attacks ground units), the Battlecruiser (the unit with the most hit points in the game), and the Ghost (another speciality unit with the ability to call in tactical nuclear strikes).Terrans explore the far reaches of the galaxy in order to expand their empire. Jim Raynor, a terran Marshal on the planet Mar Sara, is one of the main protagonists in the single player campaign. Due to several misunderstandings about the intentions of the Protoss and Zerg, Raynor is forced to join a group of soldiers that rebel against the Confederacy, the main governing body of the Terrans. This group, known as the Sons of Korhal, is how Raynor comes to know Sarah Kerrigan, the game's other main protagonist. Kerrigan is a powerful psionic human, who plays a major role in the later part of the single player campaign.Arcturus Mengsk, a high ranking member of the Sons of Korhal, clashes with Raynor during the campaign and the conflict between these two characters is central to the story. </div>  <div> Nintendo 64 Version : SCV </div>  <div> Development : MarineFirebatGhost </div>  <div> Soundtrack : VultureSiege TankGoliath </div>  <div> System Requirements : WraithScience VesselDropshipBattlecruiser </div>  <div> Legacy and eSports in South Korea : Protoss Zealot.The Protoss are a technological race that have shields for all of their units. Their units follow a ""quality over quantity"" philosophy. Protoss buildings must be constructed within range of pylons, which are also needed to raise their unit supply level.The Protoss defensive structure is the Photon Cannon, which attacks both air and ground units, and serves as one of their two methods of cloak detection. Protoss units and buildings have both regular hit points, which they have no way of regaining, and shields, which recharge slowly over time and may be recharged instantly using shield batteries.The Protoss are likely the first race to be used by new players, since their units are slightly more powerful and setting up a defensive network requires less work than either of the other two races. Notable units for the Protoss include the Zealot (a powerful early game ground unit), the Dragoon (a mobile photon cannon that can attack air and ground units), the Dark Templar (a very powerful mid-game unit that is permanently cloaked) and the Carrier (an incredibly powerful unit that can send out up to 8 automated Interceptors at a time).The Protoss seem to be based on the ancient Greeks, with their traditions of honor and deeply philosophical musings. The hero Zeratul fulfils his duty early in the Protoss campaign, but a critical mistake causes the Zerg to learn the location of the Protoss home world of Aiur.

Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto's team at Nintendo EAD, it was released alongside the console on September 29th, 1996 in North America. The game pioneered many elements of the 3D subgenre of platformer. The game sold over 11.8 million copies worldwide and was also one of the first N64 games available for the Wii's Virtual Console collection of retro releases. </div>  <div> Story : Princess Peach's invitation to Mario.The plot of Super Mario 64 starts off with Mario arriving at Princess Peach's castle at her invitation and promise of cake. However, upon arriving, he finds the castle nearly deserted and learns that the evil Bowser has once again abducted her. In order to stop Bowser and rescue the princess, Mario must explore the worlds within a series of paintings hanging in various rooms throughout the castle and collect the power stars hidden in each. Only once he has the necessary stars will he be able to face off against Bowser and save Peach. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mario is introduced to the third dimension in Super Mario 64.Super Mario 64 takes the core concepts of the 2D Super Mario titles and applies them to a 3D space. The player takes control of Mario and runs, jumps, swims, and flies through the games various stages in order to complete challenges and collect power stars. The game uses Peach's castle as a hub world; within the castle, there are paintings that transport Mario to various worlds that contain power stars. As the player collects more power stars, more regions of the castle become available with new paintings to explore. By ultimately collecting enough stars, the player is able to access the final level in which Bowser resides for the final showdown. </div>  <div> Presentation : Mario's movements are controlled using the controller's analog stick. Gentle tilts of the stick cause Mario to move at a walking pace, while tilting further causes him to break into a run. Pressing the A Button allows Mario to jump, and for the first time in the Super Mario series, he can perform actions such as a wall jump, a jumping backflip, and a running triple jump.Mario performing a backflip.Mario going for a swim.Walking - Press the analog stick gently in the desired direction.Running - Press the analog stick all the way in the desired direction.Wall Hug - Hold the analog stick at the same angle as the wall to slide along it.Jump - Press A to jump.Double Jump - Press A to jump and then again after returning to the ground to jump higher than the first jump.Triple Jump - Same as double jump but with a third jump added after returning to the ground.

The C Buttons on the N64 controller could nudge the camera to provide a better view of the action, while the C Up button zoomed the camera in to view the world from Mario's eyes.Lakitu, a character commonly seen in the Super Mario series as one of Mario's enemies, has a new role in Super Mario 64 as the game's cameraman. At times when the player is viewing Mario's reflection in a mirrored surface, Lakitu can also be seen behind him, holding the camera if the viewing angle is right. This is justified in game with Lakitu being a reporter for a popular news station who's covering the Princess's kidnapping. A similar scenario would be presented years later in Mario Kart 8 with various Toadstools covering the race events for a similar organization.  </div>  <div> Items : As the first polygonal Super Mario title, Super Mario 64's graphics were a significant change from the sprite art of Super Mario World. Super Mario 64 is also the first Mario title to feature voice acting. Mario's voice in the game is provided by Charles Martinet, who to date has provided the character's voice in every Mario title with vocals. </div>  <div> Development : LevelDescriptionBob-omb's BattlefieldBob-omb's Battlefield is comprised of green grassy fields, deep ravines, a high spiraling mountain plateau, and a floating island in the sky. It is ruled by the King Bob-omb, found atop the mountain, and his army of bob-ombs. Five cannons littered across the level make for easy traveling, but beware Wan Wan, a giant Chain-Chomp chained to a pole in the center.Whomp's FortressWhomp's Fortress is a huge floating island with a tower in the center and many smaller floating islands all around. This level is easy to fall from, and can be difficult to navigate for beginners. A tower appears after Mario defeats the evil Button King, a giant wall that tries to crush its opponents. Some enemies to watch out for are the sleeping piranha plants and mini button minions. There is also a friendly owl that will take Mario for a ride if found. This level was remade and appears again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 as part of the Throwback Galaxy.Jolly Roger BayJolly Roger Bay is an aquatic level with a deep underwater cave hiding buried treasure, sunken ships, and giant electric eels. Clams hide coins which help replenish Mario's health and prevent him from drowning. Use the metal cap to walk along the bottom of the ocean and find the turtle shell to rocket through the water.Cool, Cool MountainCool, Cool Mountain is a giant spiraling ice mountain. Mario can slide down the mountain side or go in the ski lodge chimney and race a giant penguin. Watch out for the baby penguin. Mario will want to help it back to its mother andwhile he's at it find the snowman head a new body.Bowser In The Dark WorldBowser In The Dark World is the first of three Bowser levels. This level is linear and has only one path to Bowser's lair. Only one star is obtainable in this level: a reward for collecting 8 red coins. At the top, the player must enter the green pipe and fight Bowser for the Key to the Basement. To defeat Bowser, the player must grab him by the tail and throw him into one of the bombs surrounding the arena.Big Boo's HauntBig Boo's Haunt is a level hidden inside a boo in the castle courtyard. It is a giant haunted house with many ghosts and secret rooms. Mario will have to fight Big Boos for their stars throughout the mansion, such as on a giant merry go round in the basement. Go around the back of the mansion for a secret door. Large eyeball enemies that appear in this world can be defeated if if Mario run circles around them to make them dizzy.Hazy Maze CaveHazy Maze Cave is a set of underground caverns. There are rolling boulders to dodge, fiery pits to jump, and tunnels filled with poison. Deep within this complex is a tranquil lake with a friendly dinosaur creature called Nessie who will help Mario navigate to a star, as well as the secret green P switch that unlocks green boxes. After obtaining it Mario will be able to use the metal cap to turn into Metal Mario.Lethal Lava LandLethal Lava Land is an ocean of lava with platforms and set pieces jutting up out of it. Mario must leap from platform to platform and avoid falling in the lava. This can be difficult, as many of the enemies try to bump Mario off, and some of the platforms move. In the center is a volcano that conceals a giant inner chamber.Shifting Sand LandShifting Sand Land is a giant desert with a huge pyramid in the center. It has many deadly sand traps and powerful sand whirlwinds which will throw Mario through the air. The pyramid is filled with obstacles, and two giant stone hands with eyes wait in the dark to crush Mario. There is also a giant vulture flying through the sky who is holding onto a star and can steal Mario's hat. When hatless, Mario's defense is reduced and he takes more damage.Dire Dire DocksDire Dire Docks is a water level with a huge whirlpool and a docked submarine. There is also a giant shark that Mario should avoid. Once the second Bowser stage has been completed, the submarine will mysteriously disappear.Bowser In The Fire SeaBowser In The Fire Sea is much like Lethal Lava Lands in that it is a giant lava ocean. The level extends vertically up out of the lava so that a misstep will send Mario falling into a fiery pit. Like the first Bowser level, Bowser In The Fire Sea is linear and it too has a red coins star. At the top is spirally portal that will lead to Mario's second encounter with Bowser, who holds the key for the upstairs. This battle sees Bowser with a few new tricks, but he can be defeated once again by throwing him into the bombs lining the battlefield.Snowman's LandSnowman's Land is a snow level with a huge snowman in the center. Mario can scale the snowman but should watch that he isn't blown off by the snowman's powerful breath. Mario will lose his hat if he is. The lake is frigid and will slowly damage Mario, but a skilled player can jump on the flower hatted snowmen to fly over it.Wet-Dry WorldWet-Dry world is a very vertical level. Mario can scale the cliffs and floating platforms to adjust the water level using switches. The water level present at the stage's start is dependent on whether Mario makes a high or low jump through the painting to enter the stage. There is a hidden town with a bell tower though an underwater tunnel.Tall, Tall MountainTall, Tall Mountain is all about scaling a large mountain surrounded by an abyss. There are many places where if Mario falls he will be taken back to the bottom or lose a life. There is a mischievous monkey that can steal Mario's hat and a sliding challenge much like the earlier snow lodge sledding course. Some of the most difficult tasks have Mario jumping across huge toadstools growing from the abyss around the mountain.Tiny-Huge IslandThis appropriately named level has features that allow Mario to transition between tiny and huge sizes. Depending on Mario's size, the player can affect the environment in different ways. The level has a grassy mountain in the center which can be difficult to scale. The wind is dangerous in this level and can cause Mario to fall to his doom. A giant Wiggler, an easy-to-anger centipede-like creature with boots, lives at the top of the mountain.Tick Tock ClockTick Tock Clock is a level consisting of the inside of a clock. The level requires Mario to ascend a hexagonal structure dodging swinging pendulums and riding conveyor belts and clock hands. Depending on what time it is on the clock when Mario enters the level, the level's obstacles change speed. Certain speeds will make certain stars easier to obtain.Rainbow RideRainbow Ride takes place high up in the sky and has Mario flying on magic carpets and swaying air ships. There is a giant mansion in the sky complete with a fire place and table. This course is very difficult as a single misstep will send Mario to his death.Bowser In The SkyBowser In The Sky is linear like its predecessors and also has a red coins star. It is the longest and arguably hardest of the Bowser levels and at the top is a pipe that leads Mario to his final confrontation with the Koopa King. To defeat Bowser this time Mario must launch him into three bombs instead of just one. After Bowser is hit two times the land next to the bombs falls away leaving the arena in the shape of a star. This makes the last throw to kill Bowser more difficult as it must be done from farther away. When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the super mushroom and fire flower, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the 1-up mushroom, Koopa shell, and collectible coins, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.A unique attribute of the 1up Mushroom is that it will always follow and fly to the player after they trigger it.  This would spawn a minor youtube sensation years later where players would trigger a 1up Mushroom and then attempt to complete a challenge without being hit by it. </div>  <div> Reception : Super Mario 64 CG artworkShigeru Miyamoto began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the Bowser levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named ""MIPS"". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more puzzles than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64. </div>  <div> DS Remake : The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer Koji Kondo. It was first published by Pony Canyon in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.Super Mario 64 Original SoundtrackIt's a me, Mario!Title ThemePeach's MessageOpeningSuper Mario 64 Main ThemeSliderInside the Castle WallsLooping StepsDire, Dire DocksLethal Lava LandSnow MountainHaunted HouseMerry-Go-RoundCave DungeonPirahna Plant's LullabyPowerful MarioMetallic MarioFile SelectCorrect SolutionToad's MessagePower StarRace FanfareStar Catch FanfareGame StartCourse ClearGame OverStage BossKoopa's MessageKoopa's RoadKoopa's ThemeKoopa ClearUltimate KoopaUltimate Koopa ClearEnding DemoStaff RollPirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano </div>  <div> Trivia : Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time. It was the top selling Nintendo 64 game and is the second highest selling Wii Virtual Console game. As of the end of 2007, it has sold 11.8 million copies world wide. The game is often praised as having revolutionized the 3D platformer and for pioneering many of the key gameplay concepts used in modern platforming games. </div> "

The Character Customization feature of the previous game has been removed (with the exception of Mii Fighters, who now have a more limited version of the feature).This game's version of Adventure Mode, also called ""World of Light"", involves a mysterious being named Galeem using the power of the Master Hand to consume the universe and rebuild it under its image (the ""World of Light""). Other than the sole survivor (Kirby), all of the universe's inhabitants have been turned into ""Spirits"", who have been forced to puppet clones of the universe's strongest fighters (who have been put on stasis). </div>  <div> Characters : The unlocked roster (excluding DLC).The game's base roster includes 72 playable characters (76 if counting all three Pokémon Trainer characters and all three Mii Fighter variants as separate characters).

In addition, the game includes new characters (including some from Konami's Castlevania series and Atlus's Persona series) and a new classification of characters: Echo Fighters.

Tetrisphere,H2O Entertainment,Nintendo,11-Aug-97,n64,A pseudo-3D Tetris style game involving Robots with special abilities and power-ups.,3030-3049,3049,0,8/11/1997,https://www.giantbomb.com/tetrisphere/3030-3049/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Time TrialReleased in August of 1997, Tetrisphere has the distinction of being the first puzzle game released for the N64. As the name suggests, is all about a spherical object and the tetrominoes that are joined to its core. The basic idea of the game is to remove pieces by dropping more pieces of the same shape and color onto those pieces in order to dive deeper into the core of the sphere and complete the goal. Through skillful play the player can receive power-ups that remove more pieces and will increase is power if not used. The player is usually fighting against the clock which is usually represented by the titular sphere slowly inching towards the screen. If the sphere hits the screen the player is penalized with a skull. In most modes three skulls will result in failure. In order to prevent the sphere from hitting the screen the player needs to remove pieces from the sphere which will cause it to ""bounce back"" combos give the players more time as it causes the sphere to bounce back further. The game actually started life as an unreleased Jaguar title called Phear, Nintendo however picked up the game and added the Tetris license. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Tetrisphere MenuRescue: Rescue is all about the basic principles of Tetrisphere; remove pieces from the core by dropping more pieces onto the sphere. In this mode, the player is fighting against the clock and will receive power-ups if the combo multiplier is high enough. In order to complete a level, the player must remove enough pieces from the sphere so that the creature trapped inside can escape. The player will fail the level if the player accumulates 3 skulls.Hide Seek: Essentially Rescue but with certain conditions that must either be met.Puzzle: Puzzle has no time limit and is significantly different to the other modes in that the objective is to clear the core entirely but with limited moves/slides or drops. The levels in Puzzle get progressively harder.Time Trial: Time Trial is a race against time to get the highest score possible within the given time.Vs Cpu: In Vs Cpu the player faces off against the CPU's robots in a race to release the trapped creature first. The game plays in split screen while in this mode and by making combos black debris tetrominoes will be deposited onto the opposing player's sphere. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Tetrisphere Multi-PlayerThe game does support multi-player in the form of Vs mode. Vs mode has the player competing against a computer or friend. </div>  <div> Magic/Items : In order to earn magic, the player must create combos by using power pieces (Tetrominoes). Getting a combo of eliminating 20 pieces or more should do the trick. Magic can be used to remove a large amount of pieces from the sphere all at once. Once enough magic has been collected, items will appear near the timer. Here are the items that be earned with enough magic:Firecracker: Eliminates a small section of pieces on the sphere.Bundle O' Dynamite: Gets rid of pieces that are in a spread.Electro Magnet: Pulls pieces away from the sphere like a magnet.Atom: Literally peels the top layer of the sphere like an orange.Bomb: Eliminates a great amount of pieces.Ray Gun: Cuts though and removes pieces though the core. </div> "

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six,Red Storm EntertainmentSaffire,Red Storm Entertainment,17-Nov-99,n64,"Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six puts the player in charge of an elite international team of counter terrorist operatives in a title that emphasizes planning, stealth, and tactics.",3030-7887,7887,0,8/21/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-rainbow-six/3030-7887/,ESRB: T," <div> Summary :  Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six in a 1998 video game based on the novel bearing the same name by author Tom Clancy. The video game shares many themes with the novel, including a heavy emphasis on terrorism and anti-terrorism, covert operations, and international politics. Rainbow Six has been ported to many consoles following its original PC release. Depending on the console, Rainbow Six is played in either a first-person or third-person perspective, allowing players to take the role of a covert anti-terrorist heading into action and giving commands to teammates in order to tactically defeat the enemy. The PC version was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment, except in Europe where it was published by Ubisoft.   </div>  <div> Story :  Team Rainbow is an elite international group of anti-terrorist experts, covertly sent on missions around the world in an attempt to smother out the flames of rising terrorism. The team is often assigned hostage rescue missions from director John Clark, during the course of which Rainbow is alerted to the actions of a radial terrorist organization the Phoenix Group. During several mission infiltrating the many bases of operation for the Phoenix Group, team Rainbow successfully gathers intelligence from the Phoenix Group’s biological research facility. It is revealed that the terrorist organization is planning to unleash a biological weapon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Team Rainbow immediately prepares to infiltrate the large underground network of the Olympic Village, seeking the location of the weapon, and thwarting the Phoenix Group’s plans. The Rainbow Team concludes it’s mission against the Phoenix Group by entering the group’s main facilities, resembling an ecosphere for botanical and viral research. Team Rainbow successfully incapacitates the enemy leader, taking out a major threat to world peace.   </div>  <div> Gameplay :  The gameplay in Rainbow Six forces players to strictly plan each mission, examining every tactical angle before thrown into action. Levels are prefaced with briefings that provide the player with a map of the area, suspected locations of terrorists and hostages, and entry and exit points. The player is encouraged to plot their own waypoints on the map, while choosing different alert status for the team (i.e, “escort” or “engage”). However, stock execution plans are available in the player chooses to bypass the planning stage. Four teams are at disposal to the player, one of which is in direct control through either first person or third person view. Sixteen individual members comprise Rainbow Six, each of which can be either promoted or assigned to different color coded teams, such as Gold, Red, Blue and Green. Once the mission has begun, players have access to the wide range of weapons chose during planning. For example, flashbangs temporarily debilitate enemies, which is the player’s advantage when approaching guarded hostages. The player also has the ability to advance other teams in the field, either by switching the control and view to a different colored team, or executing Go-Codes such as “Advance” or “Hold Position.” When a team member of Rainbow is incapacitated by the enemy, vital signs display the status of the downed member. If a member has been killed, he or she will be unavailable for the roster for the remainder of the game. Incapacitated members must wait to recover at least one following mission before returning to action.   </div>  <div> Multiplayer :  Rainbow Six is notable for it’s online multiplayer during a time when internet gaming was in its early stages. Many maps were multiplayer specific for the PC, such as City Street Large, a training level.  Multiplayer on the console was limited to split screen co-op gameplay. Each player controlled one of the colored Rainbow teams, coordinating infiltration of dangerous areas and evacuation of multiple hostages.    </div>  <div> Different Versions :  The Nintendo 64 version made use of nearly every button on the controller, forcing players to constantly switch between the middle and left handle. Aiming was controlled with the analog stick, for example, while reloading was designated to the left shoulder button. The Nintendo 64 version received both criticism and praise for this control scheme, as critics cited the layout’s awkwardness, while the positive reviews noted a parallel to real world actions. It was developed by Saffire. The Dreamcast version was developed by Pipe Dream Interactive and published by Majesco. The Game Boy Color version was developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by South Peak.    </div>  <div> PC Requirements :  Windows 95/98; Pentium 166 (Min.), Pentiom 200 (Rec.); 4x CD-ROM drive (Min.); 16Mb RAm (Min.), 32 MB (Rec.); 16-bit SVGA or better (2D video); Direct 3D compatible hardware acceleration reccomended; Soundblaster 16 compatible; 100MB free hard drive space; Mouse & Keyboard. </div> "

It was later ported by Fun Labs for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on December 15, 2015.The tenth main installment of the Tony Hawk series, Pro Skater 5 aimed to bring the series back to its earlier ""Pro Skater"" roots by omitting a story-based campaign and certain gameplay mechanics (such as dismounting from the skateboard). Similar to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, players navigate each level in a ""Free Skate"" fashion and earn experience points and rewards by completing missions scattered throughout. It uses an updated version of the game engine used in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.Like previous games in the series, Pro Skater 5 includes special guest characters. For this entry, King Graham (from King's Quest) and rapper Lil Wayne are included (with fellow rapper Tyler, the Creator and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles added post-release). Characters from other games are also available as character customization options, including Octodad (from Octodad: Dadliest Catch).It is the last game in the series to be published by Activision (as their licensing deal expired shortly after release). The game was known for being rushed into completion (likely due to the licensing deal expiration), with the game being mostly unplayable without a large day-one patch.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2,Edge of Reality,Activision,21-Aug-01,n64,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater returns with new levels, skaters, gameplay mechanics (including the introduction of the Manual), and the ability to create custom skaters and levels.",3030-990,990,0,9/20/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-2/3030-990/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : New ground moves in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 20, 2000. Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the ""collecting videotape"" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from ""T"" to ""E""). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater. </div>  <div> Gameplay Enhancements : While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes. </div>  <div> Levels : Create-A-Skater editor menu.Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create a skater, allowing the player to progress through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar or a custom-edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for this character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gapThe ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign. </div>  <div> Characters : The Park Editor's toolsetAlso a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the ""Manuals"" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash CollectablesCash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : HangarLocation: Mullet Falls, MontanaHangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3,Edge of Reality,Activision,20-Aug-02,n64,"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 brings the skateboarding franchise to the sixth generation of game consoles, bringing new levels, new skaters, new tricks (such as hidden trick variations and the Revert), and online multiplayer.",3030-5688,5688,0,10/28/2001,https://www.giantbomb.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3/3030-5688/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Now you can skate with your friends!Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a skateboard stunt riding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2 (on October 28, 2001), GameCube (on November 18, 2001 as a launch title), and Xbox (on March 4, 2002).The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds a new roster of skaters and new trick types (including the ""revert"", a trick that can be executed to continue a Vert combo chain once the skater hits the ground). Career Mode has been updated (removing the currency system from THPS2) while the PS2 and GC versions support online multiplayer for up to four players.The game was ported to the PlayStation in October 29, 2001 (by Shaba Games), PC in March 28, 2002 (by Gearbox), Nintendo 64 in August 20, 2002 (by Edge of Reality as the last official release for the system), and Mac in January 2003 (by Gearbox). The PS1 and N64 versions run on a slightly-modified version of the engine used in THPS2, changing the levels to fit the memory capacity. Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 15, 2001 (developed by HotGen) and the Game Boy Advance on March 4, 2002 (developed by Vicarious Visions), both of which are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint.Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, this game features crossover characters from different franchises as playable skaters. Darth Maul (a Sith apprentice from the Star Wars franchise), Wolverine (a superhero from the X-Men franchise), and Kelly Slater (a surfer from Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer) are included as hidden unlockable skaters. The PC version of the game features Doom from Quake III: Arena (as Doom Guy).Some of the levels were later released as downloadable content in the 2012 downloadable game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD (for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The revert is a move that allows players to link vert tricks into a new or in-progress combo. It is a flatland trick that is performed immediately when landing off of a vert surface like a quarter-pipe or pool lip. The more times it is used in a single combo, the slower the player's speed will be when exiting the revert. To link vert tricks into a combo, a manual must be performed immediately after the revert animation. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Despite Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 featuring large, open-ended levels, THPS3 used it's current generation of systems' power to its advantage and brought the large-scale environments to life. Areas were now filled with NPCs, moving cars that would stop at obstacles, complex animated objects and real-time level shifting. Every level in THPS3 features a large or minor-scale change that can be triggered through the player's actions and either unlocks a previously hidden area or completely changes a part of the level altogether. These could either be part of a level goal or simply a hidden secret for the player to discover. </div>  <div> Levels : One other major addition to the game was the Trick Modifier system. This is a system that has been with the franchise since, although being refined in THPS4 and perfected in Tony Hawk's Underground. The trick modifier system are ""Hidden moves"" that can be performed by actions on the face buttons. For example, hitting the button combination for a kickflip while hitting the flip trick button twice will perform a Double Kickflip. Hitting it three times will perform a Triple Kickflip. Though THPS3 refers to them as Hidden Moves (An on-screen pop-up appears with a bonus score being awarded), they have become the standard in the series for performing modified versions of standard tricks. </div>  <div> Secrets : A breakthrough addition to the series is the addition of online multiplayer. This would later be refined in later entries of the franchise but the base concept remains the same. The game allows for up to 4 players in one lobby and drops them in a Free Skate session. The host then decides which game type will be played. The various game types can be found below. Players could either play through a Broadband connection or, on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, a dial-up connection. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features a wide variety of game modes thanks to the addition of Network Play. Some new, some returning from past entries. </div> "

This entry in the series was slower than many other racing games on the N64 at the time, instead of overcoming a pack of cars your car would often just pass a single car at a time. There were only five courses in the game but they each had various seasons and times of day that would change the look of the environment. Courses would unlock as you progressed through the game; Island, Jungle, Desert and Mountain, with a fifth Industrial area course unlocked at the end of the championship. Playing further years of the championship would unlock mirrored courses and non-standard weather conditions for each course. The game also featured a paint shop where you could paint your car however you wanted. </div> "

One notable gameplay mechanic similar in both versions is the ability to transform between multiple forms: Beast Mode, Vehicle Mode, and the limited-use Robot Mode.The N64 version is notable in North America for originally being a rental exclusive to Blockbuster stores. It is also notable in Japan for its Transfer Pak compatibility with Kettou Transformers Beast Wars (which unlocks Megatron X). Compared the PS1 version, it is also notable for multiple mini-games and character-specific endings (rather than faction-specific endings). </div>  <div> Characters : Both versions of the game have different rosters of characters, with only eight characters appearing in both games. Each version of the game has 12 playable characters (4 of which are unlockable and exclusive to North America), and combined have a total of 16 distinct characters. </div> "

Players control one of Tal'Sets descendants: the Native American warrior Joshua Fireseed (who is the protagonist of the Turok comic series and novels since the original game's release) as he helps the Elders of the Lost Land prevent the Primagen's minions from destroying the Energy Totems that keep the Primagen from powering his Lightship. Guiding him is an alien liaison known as Adon, Speaker of Forever Light.Along with Expansion Pak support (which allows players to enable a high-resolution graphics mode) and Rumble Pak support, the Nintendo 64 version of the game includes a new split-screen multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete in an arena setting in one of several customizable game modes. The PC version includes online multiplayer support for up to 16 players.

It has unlimited charges that recharge over time.Crossbow - Exclusive to Multiplayer (as a starting weapon).

Can be found in rare occasions in the Remastered version's Rok Mix mode.Shotgun (Shells / Explosive Shells) - Standard pump-action double-barreled shotgun that can fire two types of ammunition: standard shotgun shells (which is better for close range due to scatter) and slugs that explode on impact.Shredder (Shells / Explosive Shells) - Upgraded version of the Shotgun.

The Nuke takes a very long time to charge up before firing, and ammo is very rare, but when it finally goes off, watch out. It fires a bullet into whatever it's pointed at that triggers an enormous energy burst which instantly incinerates every single enemy in the area, leaving behind crispy statues of ash in the shape of the enemies, yet is handily harmless to Turok. </div>  <div> Items : Yellow Health -- Raises health by 100 points (Ultra Health)Red Health -- Raises health to 100 pointsBlue Health -- Raises health 10 pointsSilver Health -- Raises health 10 pointsSatchel Charge -- Used to destroy objectivesLevel Key -- Found in every level, used to open up new levelsRed Life Force -- Gives 10 life force points (100 points will earn an extra life)Yellow Life Force -- Gives 1 life force point (100 points will earn an extra life)Eagle Feather -- Take them to Talisman Chambers to receive a special abilityPrimagen Key -- Needed to open up the door in the center of the HUB.Cave Door Key -- Used to unlock caves in the Lair of the Blind Ones </div>  <div> Enemies : DinosoidsRaptoid -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with basic weapons.Endtrail -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid equipped with advanced weapons.Fireborn -- A lizard-humanoid hybrid that has various flame-type attacks.DinosaursCompy -- The tiny Compsognathus aren't much of a threat individually, but they always travel in groups.Raptor -- Classic dinosaur enemy, very fast and lethal if not taken down quickly.

After Joshua's demise at the forces of an ancient evil known as Oblivion, the two Fireseed siblings (with one of them as the next ""Turok"") must find and destroy Oblivion.As the game has dual protagonists, players choose at the beginning of the game which of them will be the player character (with the other character restricted to cutscenes). Both characters have unique abilities and weapon upgrades, with Danielle being combat-oriented (including a grappling hook and high-powered weapons) and Joseph being stealth-oriented (including night vision goggles and technical weapons).The handheld Game Boy Color version of the game, developed by Bit Managers, was released in North America (on July 27, 2000) and Europe (on September 8, 2000). Other than the same name and box art, it is not a direct adaptation of the main game and is instead a direct sequel to the Game Boy Color version of Turok: Rage Wars. Players reprise the role of Joshua as he again thwarts the plants of the Dinosoid legion ""Amaranthine Accordance"" (who is stealing human weaponry for use against the peaceful Dinosoid group known as the ""Solidarity Order""). </div>  <div> Weapons : The game has 23 weapons total (25 if including the deathmatch-exclusive Spear and Claws), with players receiving specific weapons based on their chosen character. In the Campaign Mode, players can upgrade most of their weapons to their character's special counterpart.Unlike Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, all weapons work underwater and no weapons have alternate firing modes (although some have scope) or secondary ammo.Tomahawk (Danielle) / Blade (Joseph) - Standard melee weapon for silent close-ranged kills. Both of them can be upgraded to the Razor Wind: a three-blade chakram that is thrown and returned like a boomerang for slightly longer ranges.Bow - Simple hunting bow for silently launching arrows a long distance. It's distance and trajectory is based on how long the arrow is drawn before firing (by holding down the Fire button, then releasing it). Players can retrieve arrows from enemies killed by it. Danielle can upgrade it to the Tek Bow, which use special explosive arrows. Joseph can replace it with the Storm Bow: a high-tech scoped crossbow that allows players to fire immediately without needing to draw an arrow. It also sports a usable scope.Pistol - Standard mid-range semi-automatic handgun. Danielle can replace it with the Mag 60, which fires in three-round bursts. Joseph can replace it with the Silenced Pistol, which has both a suppressor and laser sight and can be ""zoomed in"" like scoped weapons.Assault Rifle - Standard mid-to-long range assault rifle that fires in three-round bursts. Danielle can replace it with the Firestorm Cannon: a fully-automatic minigun with a very high rate-of-fire. Joseph can replace it with the Sniper Rifle: a single-shot bolt-action rifle with a long-zoom scope.Shotgun - Standard close-to-mid range double-barreled shotgun. Danielle can upgrade it to the Fireswarm, which fires explosive projectiles that can engulf enemies on fire. Joseph can upgrade it to the Shredder, which fires ricocheting projectiles that can stun enemies.Grenade Launcher - Standard grenade launcher that fires explosive ordnance at a trajectory. Danielle can replace it with the RPG: a rocket-propelled grenade launcher that fires explosive ordnance in a completely straight trajectory. Joseph can upgrade it to the Napalm Cannon, which fires explosive ordnance that sticks onto surfaces and is remotely-detonated (by pressing the Fire button a second time).Cerebral Bore - A strange limited-use device that launches spheres (called ""bores"") that home into most enemies, latch onto their heads, drill into their skulls, and deliver a small explosion for a bloody execution. Danielle can upgrade it to the Cerebral Burst, which deliver a larger explosive payload. Joseph can upgrade it to the Cerebral Possessor, which allow players to temporarily take control of their victim (allowing them to be guided towards other enemies for the explosive payload).Vampire Gun - A unique and strange close-ranged device that leeches off of enemies, draining their health and giving it back to the user. Although it uses no ammo, failing to leech off of enemies drains the user's health instead.Personal Singularity Generator - An endgame high-tech super-powered weapon that generates black holes (which absorb nearby enemies, vaporize those inside, and release a powerful explosion). Although it uses no ammo, it has a lengthy recharge time (roughly one minute normally, or 20 seconds with the Unlimited Ammo cheat enabled). Like the Chronoscepter in Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and the Nuke in Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the weapon must be fully-assembled before use (with pieces scattered throughout each of the five chapters). </div>  <div> Deathmatch : All players (except the Raptor) spawn with the Spear, along with any weapon set that is set in the options to be given on spawn. By finding weapon pickups scattered throughout each map (and dropped by enemies), players can acquire new sets of weaponry for use. By collecting the same type of pickups, players can pick up ammo for their weapons.Five of the weapon sets include two weapons: the basic version of the weapon and one of the single-player upgrades (which is determined by the character used). Both of these versions share the same ammo pool.Bow (and either the Tek Bow or the Storm Bow)Pistol (and either the Mag 60 or the Silenced Pistol)Assault Rifle (and either the Firestorm Cannon or the Sniper Rifle)Shotgun (and either the Fireswarm or the Shredder)Vampire GunGrenade Launcher (and either the RPG or the Napalm Cannon)Cerebral BorePlayers who use the Raptor start out with their own unique weapon: their Claws.

In addition, Rage Wars includes a single-player campaign mode (dubbed ""Trials Mode"") where players complete a character-based series of matches in various game modes (including special boss fights) to unlock new playable characters and extra character skins. A special co-operative version of this mode can be played with two players, though early versions have a glitch that makes completing the mode impossible.The handheld Game Boy Color version of the game, developed by Bit Managers, was released in North America (on October 1998) and Europe (on December 1998). Other than the same name and box art, it is not a direct adaptation of the main game and is instead a direct sequel to the Game Boy Color version of Turok 2: Seeds of Evil (this time as an overhead action game). Players reprise the role of Joshua Fireseed as he again thwarts the plants of the Dinosoid legion ""Amaranthine Accordance"" (who is building dimensional gates to set up bases on four distant planets). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game contains four game modes, each can be played up to 4 players (or bots):Bloodlust - Standard  deathmatch.

Lose points by suicide and teamkilling.Frag Tag - Throughout the game, a random player turns into a small harmless target (either a monkey,  chicken, baby  raptor, or robot) with low health, and must find their way to a special area to change themselves back to normal. When the target is turned back to normal or killed, another random player is turned into a target. Score points by killing a target. Lose points by suicide.Capture the Flag - Standard  capture the flag focused on a neutral flag.

Sometimes items must also be collected and delivered. As well all opponent vehicles must be destroyed. Almost every object in a level can either be destroyed or damaged by weapon's fire. Some will drop special weapons when broken, while others will change the level, such as the giant model doughnut on a cafe which will fall off and roll around the level after the cafe is destroyed, or bridges that collapse after being weakened.Destroyed vehicles drop upgrade points that increase a character's car's parameters; at 50 points in a stat the vehicle is upgraded with an accessory and at 100 in all four stats the vehicle is upgraded to a completely new design. </div>  <div> Characters: : Dallas 13Nina LocoMoloLord Clyde (unlockable)Obake (unlockable)Boogie (unlockable) </div>  <div> Levels : SheilaJohn TorqueFlying All Star TrioHouston (unlockable)Convoy (unlockable)Dave's Cultsman (unlockable) </div> "

It was later ported by Eurocom and published by Midway (GT Interactive for the PC version) for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC throughout 1997.Similar in gameplay to their Mortal Kombat series, War Gods is Midway's first 3D fighting game (running on the same hardware as their first 3D game: Cruis'n USA) and is one of the first games to digitize photographs of real actors onto 3D models.The premise of the game involves an ancient alien starship that crashed onto Earth while transporting a special life-giving mineral (known as The Ore). Throughout time, nine humans (and a stone idol) were transformed by the power of the Ore into immortals and are each fighting to possess the remaining Ore. </div>  <div> Gameplay : War Gods uses a six-button setup similar to earlier titles in the Mortal Kombat series, with two Punch buttons (High and Low), two Kick buttons (High and Low), a dedicated Block button, and a ""3D"" button used to both navigate the 3D battlefield and sidestep attacks.Along with heavy use of chain combos, the game also has a lot of useful universal tech from the Mortal Kombat series, including uppercuts (down + High Punch), leg sweeps (back + Low Kick), and roundhouse kicks (back + High Kick). Other technical abilities include running forward (pressing Forward twice), throwing (forward + Low Punch), shoving blocked opponents (pressing Block twice), and attacking downed opponents (up + High Punch). While recovering from being knocked to the ground, players can dodge (back + Block) or make a quick attack (forward + both Punch buttons).Also like Mortal Kombat, each character has their own unique finishing move (Fatality) that can be used at the end of the match to cinematically execute the opponent. </div>  <div> Characters : War Gods includes ten playable characters and two bosses playable with cheat codes.

The player has to maneuver their jet ski past buoys, passing each buoy on alternating sides. Passing buoys on the the appropriate side in succession will grant power boosts, increasing speed, but missing one will result in a power-down. The player will earn points at the end of each race dependent on their finishing position, and the racer with the most points at the end of the tournament wins.The stunt events take place on the same tracks as the races, but this time the only goal is to score as many points as possible by doing tricks off of ramps and going through rings. </div>  <div> Courses : Similar to F-Zero, players choose from one of four racers, each with their own unique stats.R.

Some of the options include: first blood, the person who cause the opponent to bleed first wins; human torch, the first to set their opponent on fire wins; and the option to have pins and submissions count, or not.Hardcore Challenge: This is the game's main mode, similar to an arcade mode seen in most fighting games. The idea is to battle your way to a championship title shot by fighting a different opponent per backstage area. Once everyone has been beaten, the title match is unlocked. The championship belt corresponds to the difficulty, Hardcore Championship being easiest, U.S Championship being normal, and the World Championship being the hardest. Throughout the mode, the player can complete certain requirements in a match to unlock additional wrestlers and moves. Completing each difficulty rewards the player with one of three unlockable backstage areas, The Block, The Media Center and The Parking Garage; the latter being the hardest to obtain. Once completed, the player's score -- which is shown at the end of every match courtesy of a score breakdown -- is entered into the ""Hall of Champions"". The player also recieves attribute points at the end of the Hardcore Challenge.Hardcore Gauntlet: Described in the game as ""only for experts"" the Hardcore Gauntlet is a more advanced survival mode, facing 7 opponents in succesion with little time for breathers, meaning no stamina is replenished, and no re-tries. Once defeated, the player has to start the whole thing all over again. Some of the better unlockables are obtained through the Hardcore Gauntlet. Speed and efficiency are the key to winning here. </div>  <div> Commentary : WCW Backstage assault features commentary from Tony Schiavone and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan. The lines of commentary are mostly recycled from WCW Mayhem, with a handful of new lines to fit accordingly with the game's unique setting and location. </div>  <div> Reception : At the time of release, Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann, then at Gamespot, awarded the game a 5.1, citing a lack of variation as its downfall.

Also, a strong or light strike can be performed by holding the B button down or tapping it.Once in a grapple, a move can be executed by pressing the A or B buttons, either with the D-pad in the neutral position or a combination of up and down being pressed, offering a wide variety of moves that could be executed.Also in a grapple, the opponent can be ""whipped"" towards the ropes or turnbuckle using the Left-C button. Upon bouncing off the ropes and returning to the player, either variant of the grapple or strike could be executed. In the turnbuckle, much like with standard grapples, up and down on the D-pad with a press of either A or B will execute different maneuvers.Players can run using the left-C button and perform a running strike by pressing the B button. Also running into the turnbuckle will cause your wrestler to climb up it and releasing the button would perform a diving attack, depending on the position of your opponent and if they were standing or lying. With certain wrestlers it is also possible to dive out of the ring by pressing A at the correct time while running at the ropes as your opponent is outside.Taunting was also controlled by the use of the analog stick by pushing it in any direction, allowing you to raise your spirit meter. Once raising the meter to maximum it flashes with the word SPECIAL, giving you a limited time to perform the wrestlers special attack, which is often the wrestler's signature finishing maneuver. This is done by a strong grapple either from the front or rear of the opponent and tapping a direction of the analog stick.Over the course of the game series AKI further refined the control scheme, improving it with each passing game and offering a wider range of moves and ways that can be done by the time they finally released WWF No Mercy. </div>  <div> Roster : There are 42 wrestlers to select from in the character select screen, but about only half of the roster were based on their WCW-contracted counterparts. The developers of AKI employed various facsimiles of Japanese wrestlers--to waive copyrights and licensing--of their concurrently developed Virtual Pro Wrestling 64 into the roster of WCW vs. nWo to add depth to the roster tally, even if it was at a superficial level. The factions of Dead or Alive and the Independent Union are fictional composites of the Japanese promotions Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and Michinoku Pro. At an initial glance, it is quite an impressive roster. However, when compared to VPW 64, it becomes plain to see that WCW vs. nWo was given the short end by having dozens of wrestlers less than its Japanese analog. This matter can be assuaged by the assumption that most of its potential audience would have been confused by the inclusion of 80 odd ersatz Japanese wrestlers. At least WCW vs. nWo has the distinction of having ""nWo Sting"" (as a unique character), Glacier, Wrath, and the purely fictitious Joe Bruiser as exclusive members of its roster.The fictional characters and promotions created for this game are delineated by their real counterparts in parentheses. </div>  <div> Awards : Chris BenoitRic FlairEddie GuerreroLex LugerDean MalenkoRick SteinerScott SteinerStingUltimo DragonRey Mysterio Jr.Steven RegalThe GiantDiamond Dallas Page - Hidden </div> "
WCW/nWo Revenge,AKI CorporationAsmik Ace Entertainment,THQ,26-Oct-98,n64,WCW/nWo Revenge is the sequel to WCW vs. nWo: World Tour. It introduced many new features to the series.,3030-18320,18320,0,10/26/1998,https://www.giantbomb.com/wcwnwo-revenge/3030-18320/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The game would become THQ’s swan song for its WCW license on the N64. They produced 1 more WCW game for the PS1, before acquiring the WWE license. The game is regarded as one of the best wrestling games, and the best WCW wrestling game developed for any console, with the highest average rating of any WCW game on GameRankings. The gameplay accommodated very competitive multi-player, and captured the WCW atmosphere with great animations, presentation, and a huge roster. </div>  <div> Differences From WCW vs. nWo: World Tour : Revenge introduced many new features not included in it's predecessor WCW vs. nWo: World Tour. These features include: wrestler entrances, the ability to bring weapons into the ring, and instant replay. Other additions were new arenas based on the WCW's shows and pay-per-view events and the ability to edit the costumes and names of existing wrestlers. The game also introduced multiple Special moves.Several modes from WCW vs. nWo: World Tour don't return in WCW/nWo Revenge. These modes are: WCW vs. nWo, League Challenge, League, and Tournament.WCW vs. nWo was a series of elimination matches between a team of WCW wrestlers and members of the nWo. This feature would be excluded from the WWF AKI/Asmik Ace games as well, but would return in Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. In VPW2, you can choose any combination of wrestlers to be on each team; it's not specific to any faction like with the WCW and nWo.League mode allowed you to create a round robin tournament. You can choose up to 16 wrestlers, or 8 teams, to compete. This was another feature excluded from the WWF AKI/Asmik games, and would be seen again only in Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. Round robin tournaments are more popular in Japanese wrestling promotions, which is probably why they were left out of the later WWF wrestling games.League Challenge was similar to WCW/nWo Revenge's Championship mode, although each organization had their own singles and tag-team champion. WCW and DOA also had a Cruiserweight championship. In League challenge you competed against everyone within the organization before facing the champion, who was a hidden character. In WCW/nWo Revenge, the championship mode more accurately reflects the titles in WCW, with each belt having it's own path, and you face eight randomly chosen characters from the roster before facing the champion. The fictional promotions included in WCW/nWo Revenge do not have their own belts.Tournament mode was excluded from WCW/nWo Revenge, but would be featured in every other AKI/Asmik Ace wrestling game after. Single and Tag-Team elimination style tournaments in WCW were very rare, which could potentially be a reason why this mode was excluded for this game.In WCW vs. nWo World Tour a battle royal match was selectable in Exhibition mode, but limited to only four wrestlers. In WCW/nWo Revenge you could have up to 40 wrestlers compete, with new wrestlers entering once someone is eliminated. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like WCW vs. nWo: World Tour, the controls focus offensively on weak/strong attacks & grapples. Defensively the game focused on the timing of blocking and evades. The Left button acted as evade, while the right button acted as block. If the player timed a block correctly, they could counter an enemies attack. For example, if Goldberg attempted a spear and the player blocked too early Goldberg would simply be unsuccessful. If timed perfectly, Goldberg would be caught in a submission. The gameplay was highly centered on balance. Opponent’s taunts and special moves could be used against them. By rotating the analog stick counter clockwise a taunt could be stolen. If an opponent had a devastating finishing move, it could be stolen by executing a successful grapple with the special meter flashing, and pressing A B at the same time.One major issue with the game once discovered was the analog break. If a player was caught in a submission or pin, they could repeatedly push the analog stick in a direction to break free. This rendered a pin or submission attempt virtually useless against other human players. </div>  <div> Presentation : How Many nWo members can Sting take out with his bat this match?The game really captured the WCW product presentation wise. Players contained signature entrances, and taunts. Wrestlers had multiple special moves, and many signature holds. The game included the Nitro arena, along with more popular PPV themes like Starrcade. </div>  <div> Roster : The major difference between each arena is the entrance design. The logo for each arena appears in every ring except for Monday Nitro and Superbrawl. The color of the ring ropes and turnbuckles are the same for each arena. Listed below are the arenas you can choose in game, and the actual WCW events they were modeled after.Monday NitroSouled Out (Souled Out '98 - Hara Arena - Dayton, OH)SuperBrawl (SuperBrawl VIII - Cow Palace - San Francisco, California)Bash at the Beach (Bash at the Beach '97 - Ocean Center - Daytona Beach, Florida)Halloween Havoc (Halloween Havoc '97 - MGM Grand Garden Arena - paradise, Nevada)Starrcade (Starrcade '97 - MCI Center - Washington, D.C.) </div>  <div> Historical Context : ChainSuit caseBlack bat ( Sting Trademark)Silver batTrophyMicrophoneStop signTrash canChair ( La Parka Trademark)Broken Table Fragment </div>  <div> Criticisms : The roster is split up between WCW wrestlers, the two factions of nWo, and the Raven's Flock stable. Wrestlers that are unlocked in Championship mode have an asterisk next to their name.

Several cars are nearly direct ripoffs of real cars without the licensing. Starting out, you take the role of a new driver on the racing circuit looking for a break. You'll choose a team to drive for, and as you move up and win more races, faster cars will be offered to you by your team and others. Eventually, your goal is to be the world champion of sports car racing. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Far from an arcade racer, this game is as much a simulation as one could expect on the N64. The cars handle realistically, requiring careful driving to stay on the track and gain positions. Each car has its own characteristics, and the fastest cars actually seem to handle the best. There is no damage, but hitting walls or going through sand will slow you down significantly. </div>  <div> Graphics : The game does not use the Expansion Pak, but looks good even without it, especially in the high-quality letterbox mode. Cars look smooth and tracks are bright and colorful, with the exception of the night races, which can be a bit dark. </div>  <div> Career Mode : As you progress through the careeer mode, you need to win races and championships to advance. You can go back and do them over to get a better result. You start in the GT2 class, which consists mostly of highly modified road cars. As you increase your driver rank, you'll gain access to new cars and championships. When you complete the GT2 calendar, you'll graduate to GT1, driving full-on racing prototypes. Each time you win a Gold Cup, you earn 1 ""restart"" that you can use in future championship races if things are going badly. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The game offers 2-player splitscreen multiplayer, with an option for AI cars to fill out the field. You can also turn ""catch-up"" on or off, to aid a player who falls behind. </div> "

The game, based on the film of the same name, had a different developer for each of the three platforms that it was released on. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom, the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, the developer of the previous James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies, and by 2n Productions for the Game Boy Color. Versions of the game for the PC and PlayStation 2 were planned for release but were later cancelled midway through the development cycle.The Nintendo 64 version of the game featured a multiplayer mode that was absent from the PlayStation version. The Nintendo 64 version also supported both Rumble Pak and Expansion Pack accessories. The game features 14 single player missions that follow the story of the film very closely. Just like GoldenEye 007, the game featured three difficulty levels: Agent, Secret Agent, and 00 Agent. Completing missions on a certain difficulty would allow players to unlock additional multiplayer maps such as a dark Eastern European forest, a version of MI6's Scotland Headquarters and ski resort complete with working gondolas, and an airplane. The PlayStation version is known for lacking three levels, a level of difficulty and multiplayer modes.The campaign contained multiple gadgets and numerous weapons the player could use. Each weapon had a second setting on it, such as the SA90, which could switch between single and burst modes of fire.The World is Not Enough contained a robust split-screen mode found in most James Bond games. Players could customize their experience in various ways. They could choose what weapons they wanted to be available ( sniper rifles, explosive weapons, close combat etc.), choose how they wanted their avatar to look while playing in the game, have either vertical or horizontal split-screen, and select score limit and match time. Players could fight in teams, Free-for-All, Last Man Standing, uplink, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. During the game, players could pick up various gadgets and aids such as body armor and night vision goggles. </div>  <div> Weapons : P90Ingalls Type 90Meyer TMP </div> "

Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run.

Useful at creating a quick shelter underground or to flush out worms already below ground.Mail Strike: Drops five letters onto enemies.Mole Squadron: A group of mole bombs dropped from the air, which behave like any other type of strike. However, they can be detonated at will.Blowtorch: Used to dig through the ground to create shelter. Can also be used to attack other worms at close range. Does a maximum of 35 Damage.Pneumatic Drill: Much like the blowtorch but can only dig vertically downwards.Girder: Creates a girder which will protect worms from incoming attack. Can also be used to reach inaccessible areas.Baseball Bat: Can knock worms off cliffs and does a maximum of 30 damage.Ninja Rope: A rope that can be used to swing along the landscape and reach inaccessible areas.

Can be used for reaching inaccessible areas.Parachute: Can be used to jump large gaps in the terrain. Weapons can also be dropped while using a parachute.

Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes. Although extremely destructive, it is possible to survive this attack. </div> "

Taking a more complex route than the WCW world tour series. The control scheme mimicked more of a fighting game, rather than a traditional wrestling game. The game required a button sequence to pull off moves. For example: Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver required the following button sequence:Down, Up, Down, or Up, Down, Up (depending on location) + C Left on the Nintendo 64. </div>  <div> Career Mode : Using any wrestler from the roster you compete in 3 title runs, starting from the European title, Intercontinental title, and the WWF title, going through the list of wrestlers in various matches and different situations.

WWF No Mercy,AKI Corporation,THQ,17-Nov-00,n64,The sequel to WWF WrestleMania 2000 and often hailed as one of the greatest wrestling games ever.,3030-11394,11394,0,11/17/2000,https://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-no-mercy/3030-11394/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : WWF No Mercy is a professional wrestling game created by Aki Corporation and published by THQ in November 2000. The game's title comes from the pay-per-view event of the same name, and is a follow-up to WWF WrestleMania 2000. While not a considerable commercial success, the game has been deemed one of the best wrestling games ever due to its in game mechanics as well as other features which had not been featured in a wrestling game before or again until late on in the SmackDown! series such as blood and branching storylines.One possible factor why it didnt become a great commercial success is the fact that the vast majority of copies had a massive memory glitch, causing save data to be deleted at any time. THQ did release a fixed version of the game almost a year later. This version, however, had blood removed even though all related animations and first blood matches remained unchanged. Unlike its predecesor, WWF No Mercy had new matchtypes, including ladder and cage matches. Furthermore with the use of Action replay, players could unlock a variety of different add ons, such as scaffold matches, but were notoriously bugged. More recently through emulators, wrestling fans have made a patch which includes more current wrestlers, from independent promotions, called ROH vs TNA.A sequel was announced in the form of WWF Backlash which only ever appeared in Nintendo Power, but it was cancelled due to support for the Nintendo 64 dropping near the end of its lifespan. </div>  <div> Modes : Rather than having a linear story to follow or simply a set of matches to beat before a title shot, WWF No Mercy had a different storyline for each of the available championships and each one of those modes featured different career paths depending on if you won or lost. For example, the Royal Rumble match in the WWF Championship mode has several different outcomes depending on where the player finished. This gave the player many story options while playing while also adapting the difficulty to allow for different skill levels. While the mechanics of the career mode were totally original, all the storylines featured were taken from episodes of RAW is WAR and SmackDown! such as the rivalry between Triple H and Mankind from 2000 or Crash Holly's 24/7 defence of the Hardcore Title. One significant difference however is that any storylines featuring the Big Show were recreated with Right to Censor era Steven Richards.In the career mode you play through a certain title you want (heavyweight, women's, tag team. etc.). What is new to this years game is the idea of branching campaigns. Depending on how you finish a match you could possible unlock a new level for a certain chapter of a belt. There are two ways to start a title, either as the defending champion or a new guy who will work his way on the Road to Wrestlemania. The game has lists of percentages based on how many of the possible levels you have unlocked for each belt. The many ways to finish a level aren't just limited to winning or losing but how you win or lose. One match In Tag Team has the objective of smashing Bubba Ray through the announcers table and then pinning him. The possibilities for ending this match are: smash him and pin, just pin, lose, lose after smashing him. This added a whole new depth to the career mode for much more replay value. For completing each level you earn money which can be used in the Smackdown mall. Another notable feature of the career mode is the ability to use a female character to win male championships, and vice versa. Allowing players to do such things as Triple H winning the Women's Championship.  </div>  <div> Match Types : Survival mode is a 100 wrestler Royal Rumble style elimination match. You can eliminate your opponents by knocking them out of the ring as well as pinfall, submission, or knockout.You earn money that can be spent in the Smackdown Mall for each elimination, and the amount you earn depends on how you defeated an opponent. You earn the least amount of money from knocking people out of the ring and you earn the most money from scoring pinfalls.Unlike the Royal Rumble, if you are eliminated the match ends, and you are shown the total amount of eliminations you had as well as the money you earned.If you manage to secure all 100 eliminations, you are rewarded a 1,000,000 dollar bonus, effectively allowing you to purchase everything in the Smackdown Mall at once.After every ten entrants, a hidden character will enter and if you eliminate them they will be available if you have not already unlocked them by other means. The last entrant in Survival mode will always be Andre The Giant.  </div>  <div> Playable Roster : Singles MatchTag MatchTriple Threat MatchHandicap MatchCage MatchLadder MatchRoyal RumbleIronman MatchKing of the RingAll match types can have a variety of rules changed and tweaked allowing you to creat ner enough any match type you can come up with that is a variation of the ones above, from making a match falls count anywhere with no DQ's making it a hardcore match.

The Nintendo 64 version of the game also included Royal Rumble and gauntlet matches. Much like modern wrestling games, the player uses a combination of buttons to punch, kick, and grapple their opponents. Also, during some of the matches, you can set the mode to hardcore and use weapons which are available. </div>  <div> Career Mode : The single player ""WWF Challenge"" mode consists of a pyramid of television sets that the player starts at the bottom of. In each set is a different wrestler in the WWE, and as the pyramid goes higher, so does the difficulty of the matches. After the player has defeated his opponent, often that same opponent would issue a ""grudge match.""

WWF WrestleMania 2000,AKI Corporation,THQPAL/NAAsmik AceJP,31-Oct-99,n64,"WrestleMania 2000 is THQ's first game with the WWF license. It uses the AKI engine and was released on the N64 at the height of WWF's ""Attitude Era."" It is still considered one of the best wrestling games ever released.",3030-3667,3667,0,10/31/1999,https://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-wrestlemania-2000/3030-3667/,ESRB: E," <div> Gameplay : WWF WrestleMania 2000 used the AKI engine, previously seen in the studios prior wrestling games under the WCW brand ( WCW/nWo: World Tour and WCW/nWo Revenge) and as a result used many of the same buttons to perform the same moves. The D-pad is used to move, the control stick taunts, and the c-buttons can run and change targets. L dodges and R blocks. Pressing these at the last possible moment before being attacked initiates a counter move. A and B can grapple and strike respectively. Holding the buttons down perform stronger versions. After grappling, the player can use A or B and the d-pad to attempt different moves. These can be reversed with the R button.In the match itself, there is no health bar, but the wrestlers will begin to slouch, limp or hold a damaged limb. There is a momentum meter, however, which pulses more brightly and harder as moves and taunts are performed and gets slower and duller as damage is inflicted. Once the meter is maximized, a taunt will bring the wrestler into a sort of ""rage"" mode in which they can't be pinned or made to submit, their moves do significantly more damage and they can perform their devastating finisher. </div>  <div> Modes : The game featured a prominent story mode which had no branching storyline, but accurately recorded wins and losses rather than having the match won or lost based on the plot. The story generally followed the major story lines of WWF television leading up to the previous WrestleMania.There is also an Exhibition Mode, in which any match may be set up with any wrestlers. The matches include standard wrestling fare, though it was notable at the time for including a Cage Match and a First Blood, as neither of the WCW games had either.It is the also first western THQ wrestling game to feature a create-a-wrestler mode rather than a simple costume change. The mode is extensive, allowing customization of appearance, taunts, entrances and a move-set. Once a wrestler is created, the player can enter them in the Story Mode. The create-a-wrestler mode also allows the default wrestlers' costumes to be edited with four different templates for alternate costumes (or in the case of Mankind, alternate wrestlers) with the same moves. The default wrestlers' moves couldn't be changed.There is even a create-a-belt feature in which you design the look of a belt and put them up for grabs in Exhibition matches. Up to ten belts can be created and customized. </div>  <div> Playable Roster : Al SnowBig Boss ManThe Big ShowThe Blue MeanieBradshawBrian ChristopherChazChris JerichoChristianChynaDebraD'Lo BrownDrozEdgeFaarooqGangrelGerald BriscoThe GodfatherHardcore HollyIvoryJacquelineJeff HardyJeff JarrettJerry ""The King"" LawlerJim RossKaneKen ShamrockMankind / Cactus Jack / Dude LoveMark HenryMatt HardyMeatMichael HayesMideonMr. AssPat PattersonPaul BearerPrince AlbertRoad DoggThe RockScott TaylorShane McMahonShawn MichaelsStephanie McMahonSteve BlackmanStone Cold Steve AustinTerri RunnelsTestThrasherToriTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisVince McMahonVisceraX-Pac </div> "

Yoshi's Story,Nintendo EAD,Nintendo,10-Mar-98,n64,"A follow-up to Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story follows six Yoshis as they traverse the pop-up storybook version of their island to find the Super Happy Tree.",3030-15207,15207,0,12/21/1997,https://www.giantbomb.com/yoshis-story/3030-15207/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Yoshi!Yoshi's Story (known in Japan as Yoshi Story) is a 2.5D side-scrolling platformer developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 on December 21, 1997 (in Japan), on March 10, 1998 (in North America), and on May 10, 1998 (in Europe).A follow-up to Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Yoshi Story retains most of the previous game's platforming (without the ""Baby Mario"" mechanic, replacing it with a health system similar to Super Mario 64) while adding a new pre-rendered 3D art style (giving it a more distinct ""pop-up storybook"" aesthetic). It is the first game to give Yoshi his traditional voice samples (which would be recycled throughout his various Nintendo game appearances) and is known for its dynamic music (which changes in pitch, tempo, and instrument depending on the player's status) with multiple musical motifs.The game's story takes place in Yoshi's Island, which was magically transformed into a pop-up storybook by the infant Bowser after he stole the Super Happy Tree (a magical tree that grows every type of fruit on the island and the source of the Yoshis' happiness). Players control six Yoshis of different colors as they venture through the six ""pages"" of the island to grow ""Super Happy"", find the Tree, and restore the island back to normal.Unlike Yoshi's Island, where the goal of each level is to find the actual goalpost at the end, Yoshi's Story changes the end-level goal so that their current Yoshi must eat 30 pieces of fruit scattered throughout the non-linear level. In addition, the game features a unique lives system where each of the six Yoshis are ""lives"" and are captured when their health is lost (although they can be rescued by befriending special Shy Guys).The game's standard Story Mode is unique as while the game has 24 stages total, only six are played during a single playthrough (requiring multiple playthroughs to complete all stages). Stages completed throughout all playthroughs are playable in the game's Trials Mode, in which players aim to get a high score in each stage.The game was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (in 2007) and the Wii U (in 2016). It was also one of 14 games released with the 2003 iQue Player in China. The game's hand-crafted storybook nature would later be used in two spiritual successors: the 2015 Yoshi's Woolly World and the 2019 Yoshi's Crafted World. </div>  <div> Gameplay : From the start, players have access to six Yoshis, each with their own color, favorite fruit (which, when eaten by them, give additional points and restored health), and favorite color of Shy Guy (which give additional points when defeated):Green Yoshi (watermelons, green Shy Guys)Yellow Yoshi (bananas, yellow Shy Guys)Red Yoshi (apples, red Shy Guys)Pink Yoshi (apples, red Shy Guys)Blue Yoshi (grapes, blue Shy Guys)Cyan Yoshi (grapes, blue Shy Guys)This serves as the game's lives system, as the player's chosen Yoshi is captured by Bowser's forces once they lose all their health and can no longer be used. However, befriending a White Shy Guy hidden in each level and completing the level with them allows them to act as an ""extra life"", as choosing them causes them to infiltrate Bowser's Castle and rescue a captured Yoshi.Hidden throughout the game are two special Yoshis: Black Yoshi and White Yoshi. Both of them are unique as all fruits, as well as all four colors of Shy Guys, are treated as the ""favorite"". However, they cannot be rescued by White Shy Guys. </div>  <div> International Version : The game uses a per-stage scoring system, which is scored at the end of the stage by six criteria:Fruit - Determined by the type of fruit eaten. Normally, each fruit is 1 point. However, Melons and the Yoshi's favorite fruit counts as 3 points while the chosen Lucky Fruit counts as 8 points. In addition, the game uses a multiplier for eating the same type of fruit consecutively.Enemies - Determined by how many enemies are eaten or defeated. Normally, 1 point is given for eating an enemy. However, Shy Guys with the current Yoshi's color counts as 3 points. In addition, the game uses a multiplier for defeating multiple enemies at a short time, with a x2 multiplier for one enemy, x4 multiplier for two, x8 multiplier for three, and x16 for four or more.Coins - Determined by how many coins are picked up. 1 point per coin.Hearts - Determined by how many Special Hearts are picked up. 100 points per Heart.Melons - Determined by how many Melons are eaten. 100 points per Melon. This is scored in addition to the Melons counted in the Fruit section.Yoshis - Determined by how many of the six Yoshis are not captured. 100 points per Yoshi.In Story Mode, players are ranked based on all six chosen stages and slightly changes the ending based on multiple score thresholds. In Trials Mode, players are ranked on each unlocked stage. </div>  <div> Game Boy Advance Tech Demo : The International Version cartridgeBesides the standard retail versions of Yoshi's Story released across the different territories, an additional one was produced by Nintendo dubbed the ""International Version."" In collector circles, the International Version of Yoshi's Story is significant because it is among the rarest cartridges produced for the Nintendo 64, especially since its existence wasn't confirmed until well over a decade after the original game's release. The game itself is largely the same, although it contains the markings of a Nintendo 64 kiosk demo and also has the odd quirk of having its text in Japanese, despite having an ESRB rating. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Yoshi squaring off against a giant Shy Guy in the tech demo.When Nintendo originally announced the development of the Game Boy Advance in 2000, one of the available tech demos at the time was a scaled down, yet playable version of Yoshi's Story. The tech demo itself was not a port, as it only consisted of one level that repeated itself infinitely; once Yoshi traversed far enough, he automatically ended up at the beginning of the level again. Nonetheless, some basic gameplay features were retained in the GBA rendition, such as the ground pound and flower-shaped health meter. Nothing else directly related to Yoshi's Story was realized on the GBA other than the tech demo itself. </div> "
