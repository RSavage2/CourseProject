The 7th Saga,Produce,Gameplan21 (JP)Enix (NA),"August 3, 1993",snes,Seven heroes on a quest to collect seven runes to save the world.,3030-20389,20389,0,1993-04-23,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-7th-saga/3030-20389/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The 7th Saga is an RPG published by Enix in 1993 for the SNES, released in its native Japan as Elnard. Despite being a fairly straightforward RPG, the 7th Saga included a few unique twists that set it slightly apart from the crowd. First, the game provides the player with an opportunity to choose between seven different characters at the beginning, each with their own backstory and playstyle. Next, one of the core gameplay mechanics is that the other characters the player didn't choose are on the same quest, and the player can try to recruit them to their team (only one companion at a time however) or fight them for their runes. The 7th Saga is also one of the first RPGs to show enemies on the minimap, and is famous for its near impossible difficulty. </div>  <div> Characters : Each of the characters listed below are available at the onset of the game, and will continue to play a vital role in the story (some more so than others). When choosing a companion character, it is good to balance their strengths with the player character's weaknesses. </div>  <div> Story : Wilme in BattleAn alien of unknown origins but apparently on a quest for the power the runes can provide, Wilme specializes in fire magic and other fire-based attacks. He has high HP but can equip only certain items. </div> "
A.S.P.: Air Strike Patrol,SETA,SETA (JP/NA)System 3 (EU),"February 18, 1994",snes,"Air Strike Patrol is an isometric, tactical jet fighter shoot 'em up developed by Opus for the SNES. It was released in Europe by System 3 Software, where it was known as Desert Fighter.",3030-18670,18670,0,1994-02-18,https://www.giantbomb.com/asp-air-strike-patrol/3030-18670/,," <div> Overview : A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol (Desert Fighter in Europe and Japan) is an isometric jet fighter game superficially similar to EA's Strike series. The player must choose a load-out for their fighter jet and has a series of mission critical targets to find and destroy, but they can also explore the large maps for additional goals, fuel and ammo permitting.The game was originally published in Japan by SETA Corporation in early 1994. It would be released in Europe later the same year by System 3, and then in the US the following year. </div>  <div> Story : A.S.P. takes place in a fictionalized version of the Gulf War of the early 90s. The player is a UN jet fighter pilot, a member of the eponymous Air Strike Patrol, who is assigned various missions in areas around a fictitious Middle Eastern country named Zaraq. The ultimate goal is to oust Zaraq's dictator, who is later revealed to be working with some unconventional outside help. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players are expected to outfit their craft before sorties (mission attempts), using upgrades they've acquired to equip one of two real jet fighters: The  F-15 and the  A-10. After reviewing the mission report and selecting an entry point, the player begins their sortie.Sorties play similarly to the Strike games: The player controls a jet plane flying a few hundred meters from the ground in an isometric landscape. Their fuel and ammo is limited and they must destroy as much of the mission targets (while also observing secondary missions, such as limiting civilian casualties and property damage) before they must leave the mission area to refuel. Targets appear on a mini-map, and each destination (RADAR bases, chemical weapons factories, etc.) have several buildings which count towards its destruction percentage. Usually hitting a certain target percentage is all that's necessary for mission completion, though occasionally this target is 100% and the player must be careful to eliminate every element on every base.After a sortie, the player is rated on how effective they were, including speed, accuracy and damage caused to the enemy (including non-mission targets) and are penalized if they let their jet get destroyed (which happens at zero fuel or zero health) or if they eliminated any friendly units, which tend to have brighter/greener coloration, or Zaraq civilians. The player then starts the process over with the next sortie, until the mission target has been reached. Most missions have multiple areas the player must visit for their mission goal, and may only visit one per sortie.Each region has a finite amount of resources, including enemy troops. Players can use the map to see how many enemy units are left on the map: If the player has remaining fuel and no more mission targets during a sortie, they may decide to chase these enemies down. These are generally non-crucial to missions, but may enhance the player's final score. </div> "

Along with throwing garbage at enemies, players can perform a limited-use ""scare"" which, if done at the right time, instantly defeats normal enemies on the screen (and takes out a significant amount of hit points on boss characters). </div> "

ActRaiser,Quintet,Enix,"November 1, 1991",snes,ActRaiser is a hybrid of two genres: city-building and action platformer. The player takes control of the powerful entity known as the Master in his quest to rebuild civilization.,3030-7274,7274,0,1990-12-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/actraiser/3030-7274/,ESRB: E10+," <div> Overview : The title screen of the Super Nintendo versionActRaiser is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System city-building simulation and action hybrid. The game was developed by Quintet and published by Enix (before their merge with Square), and the game was released during November of 1991. Although there was a sequel for the game, ActRaiser 2, it completely abandoned the simulation aspects of the original, which caused many fans to dislike it.ActRaiser was also released in 2007 on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, North America, and Japan. European mobile phones got a version of the game with a 2004 release as well. The game was also part of the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system that allowed gamers to preview upcoming releases.ActRaiser is a relatively well-received game. It was accepted into GameSpot's Greatest Games of All Time in 2003 and was rated the 150th best game on a Nintendo system by Nintendo Power. </div>  <div> Plot : Not much of a plot exists in the actual game itself in ActRaiser. However, much is explained via the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet states that Tanzra and his six guardians attacked the Master. The Master was injured after the long battle, so he retreated to his sky palace and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.While the Master was sleeping, Tanzra drove the world into ruins. He divided the world into six lands with each being ruled by one of the guardians. When the Master awakes, fully rejuvenated, he is ready to free the world from the oppression of Tanzra.After defeating Tanzra, civilizations begin to stop worshiping the Master with many losing faith in him and turning to other things. The servant notes this, and says that people only appear to pray and trust to the Master in times of trouble. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In ActRaiser, the player takes control of an incredibly powerful being known only as the Master. The Master has been awakened from a deep sleep to find the world in ruin. He and his loyal servant (a small angelic creature) then set out to rebuild civilization.The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a bossTo begin this rebuilding process, the Master positions his sky palace above an area filled with enemies and demons. Then, the Master takes on the form of a strong warrior wielding a large sword. In these side-scrolling areas, the warrior uses his sword to dispatch many hazards, such as environmental hazards or monsters. The warrior can pick up power-ups by destroying statues situated in certain places around the level. The power-ups have a variety of effects, from healing the warrior, to bonus points. After defeating the boss of the level, the warrior moves onto the next section of the city-building portion.The life bar that the Master has in his warrior form can also be extended as the Master gains levels. Leveling up is done through an experience system, in which the combined population of the Master's rebuilt towns amasses into experience. Also gained in leveling up is more SP, which can then be used to preform miraculous events in the city-building part of the game. Magical spells can also be granted to the Master through his followers that he can use in his warrior form. These spells deal significantly more damage than regular attacks, making them essential to the completion of the game.In the city-building portion of the game, the player takes control of the Master's servant, a small cupid-like creature. Each town begins with only two humans, who then follow the Master's commands and aid him in rebuilding his world. They must be guided (the direction they are guided in is where they will build), and in turn will build houses, roads, and farms. The villagers eventually gain use of other skills, such as composing music or creating bridges.Building a cityThe Master also has the use of several magical powers in the city-building portion. He can summon lightning, rain, sun, wind, or earthquakes. Using these abilities, trees, rocks, snow, monsters, and much more can be cleared. In a few sections of the game, the abilities must be used to assist the villagers, starting windmills or putting out fires, for example.However, the city-building isn't calm. There are several Monster Lairs scattered around the map. Monsters are spawned out of these lairs. The people have the ability to seal these lairs, making it a necessity to guide the population to the lairs. The cupid can attack the monsters using his arrows, but once he loses all of his life, he cannot attack until the people increase in population. Once all of the Monster Lairs are sealed, the people can gain even more advanced technology and techniques. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Symphonic Suite from ActRasierThe critically acclaimed 16-bit soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Brad Shoemaker described it as:Orchestral video game soundtracks are the norm these days, but back then, the realistic instrument samples really brought out the beauty of Koshiro's aural backdrop. Even though it was a first-generation SNES game, ActRaiser's score remains one of the finest on the systemOn Sep. 21, 1991, Koshiro released a 'Symphonic Suite From ActRaiser' CD that used a full orchestral arrangement for the soundtrack.

The story involves Ektor narrowly surviving his climactic battle with Aero in the previous game, getting saved by his henchman Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, while Aero accidentally falls into a magician's box and is teleported to an unknown location.As with the previous game, the platforming is built around Aero's ability to ""drill"" through the air. This works as both a means to attack enemies and as a double jump to get around obstacles, though the distance and direction is fixed: Aero can only fly at a 60 degree angle up or down (dependent on whether or not the player is holding down on the D-pad). Levels also have a number of secret areas and power-ups to find, often behind fake walls. Aero the Acro-Bat 2 also includes snowboarding levels.The credits of Aero the Acro-Bat 2 features a dedication to Ayrton Senna, the Formula One racer who passed away in the May of 1994. </div> "

Alien³,Probe Entertainment,LJN,"May 17, 1993",snes,An action game from Acclaim based on the 1992 David Fincher movie. The player assumes the role of Ripley as she explores the prison planet of Fury 161.,3030-14356,14356,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/alien3/3030-14356/,," <div> Overview : With the release of the Alien 3 film several games were released to tie into the film. With the Super Nintendo and Genesis as the leading platforms the game was built and ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64 and Game Gear. The games are set on the world of the film, Fury 161, but the gameplay actually has more in common with the film Aliens, throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player. Whereas in Alien 3 there was only one xenomorph.The video game versions (except the Nintendo Entertainment System) were praised at the time of its release for not sticking with the lack of guns and multiple aliens in the film, which was the film's most criticized aspects. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The SNES version had varied missions to complete.In the SNES version, Ripley begins the game in a corridor where she can operate a computer terminal which gives her access to various missions. Missions have Ripley completing objectives such as destroying groups of eggs, fixing pipes or junction boxes, isolating rooms, killing Alien Queens or rescuing trapped inmates. Completing these missions leads to the game's ending, which is closer to the movie than the other versions. Like most versions of the game, the SNES version was liberal with the material, generating waves of enemies to combat.Unlike the other versions of the game, health, ammo and enemies respawn during the levels.There are 6 levels in total, each having a range of missions in them. Since completing a level takes around half an hour to an hour, the levels can be accessed via a password system.The soundtrack is inspired on that of the film's, unlike the Genesis's more action game music. Complex orchestrations delivered by the SNES's sound chip accompany the game to give it a movie-like feeling.The graphics are also superior, having rich detail in the backgrounds and effects like smoke and rain occurring in parts of Fury 161. Ripley and her enemies have smooth animations and there are lighting effects on the scenery and/or the objects when using a flame thrower in egg rooms or closing a door.The SNES version was released after the movie, therefore it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or scenery present at the time of the other versions' developments. </div>  <div> Genesis Version : The Genesis version was a slightly different case. Instead of missions in a large, persistent area, the game uses stages (or levels) like many other platformers of the time. The majority of these see the player fighting their way through hordes of Aliens in order to rescue prisoners before the timer runs out. When the timer does run out, the player is show a scene of each of the remaining prisoners giving birth to a chestburster Alien. In addition to these rescue missions, there are other mission instances. Every few missions the player must fight a boss alien (and in the games finale, two at once) and occasionally, the player will have to rescue lots of prisoners, without interference from Aliens. As well as the opposite, having to shoot lots of Aliens and reach the exit without needing to rescue prisoners.Rescue the prisoners as fast as possible, before this happens.The game consists of roughly 20 missions, each increasing in difficulty and features several different locations from the movie (such as the prison grounds, the lead works, the slaughter house, the Alien nest, etc) and features a number of weapons commonly seen in the franchise (but ironically, none of which were seen in the actual film) the pulse rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher and hand grenades.In addition to this, the player is given health and battery pickups. The battery pickups allow the motion tracker in the top right hand corner of the screen to work for a short time, but once the battery has run out it reverts to being blank again until the player picks up another battery. Enemies include the ubiquitous Alien, as well as much later in the game Eggs and Facehuggers, in addition to the larger boss Aliens.Since the movie was subject to various creative inputs due to a lack of consent over the final script, many things were scrapped but some remained in the video game, such as the abattoir level (which is present in the recent Alien 3 Assembly Cut) and the fact that Ripley survives in the end. </div>  <div> Master System, Game Gear, Amiga and Commodore 64 Versions : The Master System and Game Gear versions are very similar to the Genesis version, the first few levels are exactly the same but with a major graphical downgrade. The player has access to largely the same arsenal of movements and weapons, as well as having a countdown clock and prisoners to rescue. Beyond the first few levels, they begin to differ slightly, but not much from the Genesis version of the game.The Commodore 64 version follows the same principle and scenery of the Genesis game, but with altered level design.The Amiga version looked and played similar to the Genesis version in terms of graphics but the player had to choose either to play the music or sound effects but not both. </div>  <div> NES Version : The NES version was developed by LJN LTD, and featured a drastically different visual style as well as gameplay mechanics. The graphics are indistinct, the Alien creatures appear to be vague shapes of solid color and the game world itself features a lot less detail than that of the Master System, or other versions. The game features a large HUD which occupies the bottom portion of the screen and displays information such as remaining ammunition. The game's sound effects were also a much lower quality than that of other versions. The game featured a variety of different mission locations taken from the film, and like the other versions the main objective throughout the game is to rescue prisoners on each level before proceeding to the exit.Though seen as a mediocre game at the time of its release, the game has been heavily criticized as time went by. </div> "

Aliens vs. Predator also includes a three-way multiplayer mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Alien vs. Predator 3's story starts on a planet designated BG-386 where a mining colony has discovered an ancient pyramid most likely created by the Predator race who have been alerted of the human's discovery of their pyramid. A group of hunters are dispatched to make sure the pyramid and what lay dormant inside it stay sealed and locked away at all costs. But it may be too late as the Alien species locked inside it for untold years has begun to awaken. </div>  <div> Singleplayer : The Marine campaign begins with two squads of Marines in two drop ships above the planet who have been ordered for a combat drop. One ship, dubbed the USS Marlow is destroyed by a Predator drop ship after it comes out of cloaking. Major Van Zandt then directs the surviving ship to land, but the player Marine, named Rookie, is knocked out during the drop. After he wakes up, he meets up with another marine named Corporal Tequila. Tequila instructs the Rookie to get systems back online to locate the remaining marines, including Major Van Zandt. Unfortunately, the Major is found cocooned which forced Rookie to shoot him.Rookie moves further into the hive where he confronts the Alien Queen whom he burns alive and destroys in an explosion through the help of Tequila. Rookie then begins to move through the swamp and is contacted by Tequila who sends a dropship to rescue Rookie. Unfortunately, the dropship crashes after being shot down by an unknown force leaving the Rookie alone. The Rookie is then contacted by the colony's administrator named Katya. Katya gives the Rookie instructions to find other survivors throughout the colony. The Rookie also kills a Predator and rescues Tequila who is now infected with a chestburster. Tequila asks Rookie to shoot her, but Katya tells them that they could operate on Tequila to remove the chestburster. However, Weyland the president of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, finds out about the procedure and cuts the power to prevent it. They are then forced to put Tequila into a stasis pod in order to keep the Alien from hatching.With the dropship and the USS Marlow destroyed, Katya tells Rookie, after revealing that Katya is an android, that Weyland has his own personal dropship as well as a personal datapad with sensitive information on it. They then leave to confront Weyland who was actually an android all along, in order to get the datapad and get themselves off the planet. The three characters are then seen in cryo sleep on-board the dropship and traveling to Weyland's personal ship where Weyland is delighted to learn that the chestburster in Tequila is secure and that the personal datapad remained intact and gave him the sensitive information he wanted, the location of the Xenomorph home world. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : In this game you will face many different enemies and challenges based on what character you choose (Alien, Predator, or Human). To make it simple there is a list below that shows every single type of creature there is </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : Facehugger: The small creature that makes it all possible. The facehugger's sole purpose is to impregnate other species with eggs, which produce chestbursters that grow into mature aliens. Facehuggers are encountered on a few occasions, often in dark areas and around large eggs and mature aliens. They're small, agile targets that are difficult to hit. If the player's health is low, facehuggers can kill the player outright.Warrior: The most common Xenomorph encountered by the player in the Predator and Marine campaigns. Although it possesses no special abilities, it's speed and agility make it a deadly enemy, especially when in groups.Jungle Alien: Very similar to the Warrior, but brown in color. In addition to having the melee capabilities of the Warrior, the Xenomorphs encountered in the jungle are able to split deadly acidic fluid across great distances.Praetorian: One of the toughest Xenomorphs the player will encounter, these large females will eventually grow and become new Queens. The Praetorian can easily be identified by the large crest on it's skull, which is similar to that of a mature Queen. They are encountered as  mini-bosses in the Predator and Marine campaigns.Predalien: The result of a facehugger impregnating a Predator. Unlike the Warrior, the Predalien lacks the ability to climb walls but makes up for this by possessing incredible strength, endurance and a remarkable jumping distance. The Predalien is easily identified by it's large stature and the dreadlocks that hang from it's skull. This abomination is easily the strongest Xenomorph encountered by the player. </div>  <div> Xbox 360 Installation : As a colonial marine known only as ""Rookie,"" the player must rely on guns, flares, and a motion tracker to survive. Although there are few main characters in the story line, Rookie occasionally receives backup from fellow his fellow marines. The key to surviving this rather traditional first-person shooter is your skill with one of six main weapons (each of which has a secondary fire mode):1. Pistol: Your backup weapon throughout the game, and the only weapon with unlimited ammo; effective for clipping enemies from a distance without wasting bullets, killing facehuggers, and finishing off crippled aliens; holds 18 rounds at a time and fires three-round bursts in secondary mode2. Assault Rifle: One of the weaker weapons in the game, though its large clip (99 rounds) and grenade launcher attachment make it useful for taking out jungle and warrior aliens3. Sniper Rifle: The most powerful weapon in the game in terms of damager-per-bullet; can take most enemies in one to two shots; scope allows user to see outline of enemies in darkness/dense jungles4. Smart Gun: Very powerful weapon made famous by Vasquez (likely the basis for the character Tequila in this game) in the film Aliens; weaknesses include limited ammunition and size (takes up two of three weapon slots); primary mode automatically targets enemies, while secondary mode allows for free fire.5. Shotgun: Very powerful at close range, secondary fire uses both barrels.6. Flamethrower: Good against the xenos, if you set the xenos on fire and then shoot them with another weapon they will explode. Secondary fire lets you put down fuel that you can then light on fire. </div> "

Although they share some similarities, the two games are quite different. The SNES version of the game allows for the player to switch between the three characters, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, at will. There are no actual ""lives"" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to ""try and take over the world"". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm (""air kiss"") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and ""welcoming"" the player to the game). </div> "

Art of Fighting,Monolith Corporation,Takara,"December 1, 1993",snes,"SNK's second foray into the fighting game genre, known for its dedicated linear story, camera zooming effect (allowing for large character sprites in close-range combat), and the introduction of a gauge that depletes when certain moves are used.",3030-2760,2760,0,1992-12-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/art-of-fighting/3030-2760/,CERO: B," <div> Overview : Art of Fighting (known in Japan as Ryuuko no Ken, roughly translated to ""Fist of the Dragon and Tiger"") is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  SNK for arcades (running Neo Geo MVS hardware) on September 24, 1992.Although overshadowed by  Street Fighter II, released a year earlier, Art of Fighting innovated the fighting game genre through its use of large character sprites (with battle damage), camera zooming, taunting, super and ""desperation"" moves, and a ""spirit gauge"" that depletes when certain moves are used.The game takes place in the late seventies in the fictional city of South Town, where martial artists  Ryo Sakazaki and  Robert Garcia must find out the whereabouts of Ryo's kidnapped sister,  Yuri. The game is set decades before the events of SNK's other fighting game at the time,  Fatal Fury. SNK would regularly find ways to integrate characters from this game into Fatal Fury and vice versa before eventually creating The King of Fighters series, which pits characters from both Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting against each other irrespective of continuity.The game was released on the Neo Geo AES on December 11, 1992, and ported to the Neo Geo CD (as a launch title) on September 9, 1994. It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Monolith (released by K. Amusement in Japan on October 1993 and by TAKARA worldwide on December 1993), the Sega Genesis by SNK (released by Sega worldwide on January 1994), and the PC Engine CD-ROM² (requiring the Arcade Card add-on) by Hudson Soft (exclusively in Japan on March 1994).The original version has been re-released in the 2006 PlayStation 2 compilation Art of Fighting Anthology and the 2008 compilation SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 (for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Wii). It was also digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console) by D4 on October 8, 2007, the PlayStation Network NEOGEO Series (on December 21, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable), and the Arcade Archives series by HAMSTER (on March 23, 2017 for the Xbox One and on April 20, 2017 for the PlayStation 4). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays like traditional fighting games. The player has two basic attack buttons: punch and kick. The third button is a ""utility"" button which can allow the player to do stronger punches and kicks (when combined with the punch or kick buttons), throws, and walljumps. The fourth button is a taunting button. Not every character can perform throws and walljumps. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireballs can be canceled out using punches or kicks.The game also features a ""spirit gauge"", which controls when the player can perform special and super moves. The gauge lowers after the player performs a special/super move. The more powerful the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when the opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually by holding down either the punch or kick button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left.Only Ryo and Robert have super (the Haou Shou Ken) and ""desperation"" (Ryuko Ranbou) moves that can only be learned through a special bonus stage. Both moves take up much of the spirit gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar).In single-player Story mode, the player is usually at a disadvantage with shorter life and spirit gauges. These can be increased in special bonus stages, where the player must perform a certain task (careful button pressing or button mashing). </div>  <div> Characters : The game features 10 playable characters, the two protagonists being the only ones playable in single-player Story Mode: Ryo Sakazaki Robert GarciaIn Story Mode, the game progresses as follows against each opponent consecutively: Ryuhaku Todoh Jack Turner Lee Pai Long King Mickey Rogers John Crawley Mr. Big (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)??? (a mysterious masked palette-swap of Ryo later known as ""Mr. Karate"", the alter-ego of Ryo's father Takuma; only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code) </div> "

Whereas the first game was a sports game, the sequel takes a very different turn and goes the JRPG route, setting the game in a post-cyberpocalypse with Charles Barkley as the main character. The game is best known for its absurd humor, entertaining battle system, and the fact it was independently developed and subsequently released for free. </div>  <div> Story Summary : The Great B-Ball Purge of 2041, a day so painful to some that it is referred to only as the ""B-Ballnacht"". Thousands upon thousands of the world's greatest ballers were massacred in a swath of violence and sports bigotry as the game was outlawed worldwide. The reason: the Chaos Dunk, a jam so powerful its mere existence threatens the balance of chaos and order. Among the few ballers and fans that survived the basketball genocide was Charles Barkley, the man capable of performing the ""Verboten Jam""...Flash forward 12 years to the post-cyberpocalyptic ruins of Neo New York, 2053. A Chaos Dunk rocks the island of Manhattan, killing 15 million. When the finger is put on the aging Charles Barkley, he must evade the capture of the B-Ball Removal Department, led by former friend and traitorous baller Michael Jordan, and disappear into the dangerous underground of the post-cyberpocalypse to clear his name and find out the mysterious truth behind the Chaos Dunk. Joined by allies along the way, including his idiotically-named son Hoopz, Barkley must face the dangers of a life he thought he gave up a long time ago and discover the secrets behind the terrorist organization B.L.O.O.D.M.O.S.E.S. </div>  <div> Game Mechanics : Shut Up and Jam Gaiden is based on the JRPG format in that the player controls a party that travels around a world from a top down view while battling enemies within a separate battle screen. However it seems that this gameplay format was chosen as it offered an opportunity to lampoon the genre of JRPGS. Many elements of the game parody typical JRPG archetypes; for instance, the game's saving system ""Otaku Game Pumps"" present the player with various embarrassing diatribes from supposedly genuine otaku forum posts before the player can save.Though seen as a humorous game, many elements you'll find in Shut Up and Jam Gaiden are surprisingly serious and well refined. The general flow of the game follows that of a typical JRPG you might find on the SNES, though the humor, dialogue, and certain parts of combat are most certainly influenced by typical modern day games. One example of current day influence includes the addition of quick time events, which occur sporadically throughout cut scenes. </div>  <div> Development/Technical Details : Perhaps most surprising of all is its full featured and unique turn-based combat system. It contains several novel features including several moves and spells that are dependent on mini games, concepts which are similar in style and execution to games like Super Mario RPG. Each character has an entirely unique set of moves which often come with their own unique mini game; one character you find has a combo based combat system, while Barkley requires you to time various basketball jumps and moves to deal damage.In addition to normal attacks each character has specials skill they may use similar to magic in other games. These skills help define various classes for each character, as one party member has heal/buff spells, while another has magic-like status effects and elemental attacks. </div> "

It later spawned a short-lived series of platformers (along with its revival decades later).An enhanced version for the PC, titled Super Bubsy, was released in 1995.

Players run through levels, attempting to reach the end of the level (before the time runs out) while eliminating enemies, gaining score, collecting powerups, and avoiding deadly obstacles. The game includes fifteen main levels (called ""chapters"") split up into six main areas (ranging from forests to the Wild West) and one final level (set in space).Bubsy has two abilities at his disposal: jumping (by pressing the Jump button) and gliding (by pressing the Glide button). Gliding reduces his downward falling speed, and activating it at the right time before bouncing up allows Bubsy to be propelled much higher than usual.Running into enemies, touching deadly obstacles (such as water, spiked pits), and fall damage can kill Bubsy in one hit (as he has no health system whatsoever). However, jumping or gliding onto enemies can eliminate them (getting them out of Bubsy's way while giving the player score). Due to the difficulty, there are plenty of checkpoints (for Bubsy to respawn at) and extra lives (as if starting with nine lives, like the cat mythology, is easy enough) scattered around levels. </div> "

In fact, the eponymous  protagonist, a  superhero, has diabetes himself. The game follows Captain Novolin's mission to save the mayor of Pineville (also a diabetic) from the alien Blubberman. To make matters worse, the mayor can only survive forty-eight hours without insulin. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Before each level, the game--with the help from a couple of  doctors--goes through what Captain Novolin should eat and avoid depending on the meal and time of day. The player must then check his glucose level and inject insulin into his blood stream.Speedboat jumpingThe game plays like a standard platformer that plays from left to right. Enemies (aliens disguised as ""sugary junk"", like  candy, chewing gum, and  donuts) come from the right, and usually either run, jump, or  fly towards the player. They can be avoided with well-timed  jumps and dashes or stomped on, and being hit by them will cause Captain Novolin to lose  health. Occasionally, Captain Novolin rides a  speedboat, but this doesn't change the fundamental basics (Novolin can still jump with the speedboat) besides the fact that he's constantly moving forwards.Littered throughout each level are various foods. The type of foods depend on the time of day. For example,  bananas and  cereal crop up in the morning, while  chicken and potatoes appear at night. A suitable amount of these healthy foods must be picked up to keep Captain Novolin's glucose level stable; too many, and the character will fall onto the ground, face down, unconscious (and one life is lost) with a message informing the player that his blood glucose level is too high. Players can earn bonus points by answering multiple choice questions about diabetes correctly at  checkpoints.Each level is also  linear with no alternate paths or hidden levels. At the climax, the player must defeat the only  boss in the game--the  antagonist Blubberman, who throws  pies--before saving the mayor. </div>  <div> Reception :  A donut-disguised alienCaptain Novolin is regarded as one of the worst games on the SNES, with many people citing the shallow and repetitive gameplay as the main reason. However, given its educational purpose, it is unlikely that the developer made gameplay its highest priority. </div> "

Maria, who was playable in the Saturn version of the game, is playable in this version, as well. </div>  <div> Games : Richter Belmont, protagonist of Castlevania Rondo of bloodThe main change in this game is that it was remade as a 3d game in a 2d plane, so it continues to be a sidescroller like most Castlevania games are, but unlike most of the new 2d Castlevania games that came out in recent years, this one doesnt have the exploration or RPG elements of those recent games.It resembles more the original gameplay style of the series, go from point A to point B getting rid of everything in the way.Multiple paths lead to the end of the level and eventually a confrontation with Dracula. In each level there are hidden rewards that give new tracks for the soundtrack or even two new games to play. </div>  <div> PS Vita Compatibility : This game is a sequel to the main game. It takes place a few years after the first one and puts the player in control of a new character: Alucard, son of Dracula.The game was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. First Castlevania game to use the ""explore the castle - lvl up formula"" of the recent games. It became a success.The formula has been emulated and used in handheld Castlevania games for a number of years now. It seems to be a staple of the series.The game allows Alucard to explore the rooms of Dracula's castle in any order. However, different areas are restricted until a special ability is acquired that allows passage to the new area or bypass the obstacle blocking the way. Alucard will level up by gaining experience from defeated monsters, which can done away with by using many different weapons and spells found in the game. Different weapons can mean different abilities or different approaches to the many enemies found in the game. </div> "

It is currently available for download on Steam and GOG.com. </div>  <div> Story : A screenshot from the game's introduction.A time traveler takes a journey back to Victorian England, bringing fabulous technology. However, his futuristic technology falls into the hands of the evil Baron Fortesque, who retrofits the equipment for his own personal means, thereby creating an alternate timeline. The Baron creates what comes to be known as the ""Chaos Engine"", a terrifying machine with the potential to alter the matter of time and space. After prolonged use, the machine absorbs the Baron, making him a part of the machine. This turns out to be the last the world would hear of the vile dictator. However, things don't end there, as the ramifications of the machine echo, as it turned humans savage and feral, creating terrifying androids and resurrecting prehistoric beings. The English countryside changes forever. Out of panic, what remains of the government hires the best soldiers of fortune in the world to shut down the Chaos Engine and save humanity.Now, six greedy guns-for-hire, motivated by money, set out to destroy what remains of Fortesque's empire. This is where the game begins. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The object of the game is to traverse levels while destroying as many enemies as possible. Scattered throughout each level were various one time powerups, special abilities, food, and money, which was used to purchase upgrades every second level. These upgrades include speed, power, and intelligence. Each playable character had specific weapon types, be it The  Scientist's weapon which can pierce through enemies, to Mercenary's fast but weak gatling gun.The game has 4 worlds, each consisting of 4 levels.

Too Cool to Fool has Chester passing through a series of stages eating cheesy snacks and avoiding perils.The game was eventually followed up with Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest, also for the Genesis and Super Nintendo. </div>  <div> Story :  Chester Cheetah is being held against his will in the Four Corners Zoo by the zookeeper, Mean Eugene. Chester Cheetah orders a motorcycle from a catalogue to help him escape from the zoo, but Mean Eugene intercepts the package and hides the parts around the zoo. With the help of his friends, The Hip-O and Funky Monkey, Chester must find the parts to his motorcycle so he can ""ditch this zoo and ride away to Hip City, USA."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a fairly straightforward platformer with the only actions available to the player being walk, run and jump. Enemies are dazed (occasionally killed) by being jumped on. Extra lives are gained by collecting one hundred Paw Badges. The factor that differentiates Too Cool to Fool from other platformers is the objective of having to find a motorcycle part in each level. The player can find the exit to each level, but they can't use it until they have found the motorcycle part. </div>  <div> Stages : There are five stages in Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool each with a different theme and different enemies.Stage 1: Four Corners Zoo ParkMy God it's full of sewers! This stage starts with Chester chilling on a bench when Mean Eugene and Grunt, his dog, run by with a box full of Chester's motorcycle parts. Chester leaps off the bench and hops into action. This appears to be an entirely flat plane with a few areaa, but the majority of it takes place underground in a maze of sewer pipes.Stage 2: Monkey Pits This stage has a jungle theme and is a fairly vertical level with lots of vines and trees to climb. Funky Monkey helps Chester in this level by jumping on enemies and retrieving the motorcycle from a branch that Chester can't reach.Stage 3: Gator Alley A very horizontal level taking place over water that is filled with enemies and areas where Chester will fall into the water. The Hip-O helps Chester by acting as a moving platform so he can cross some water. There is a lengthy boat section where Chester must avoid Mean Eugene's boat and some logs.Stage 4: Hidden CavesA cave stage filled with bats and boulder punching pigs. This level has many pitfalls that will cause the player to be looped back to the beginning of the stage. It also has a lengthy  mine cart sequence that, like the boat section in the previous level, involves dodging Mean Eugene.Stage 5: Bird HouseThe first seconds of this level take place on a jungle canopy but as soon as you can say ""Dangerously Cheesy"" Chester is launched onto the back of a large butterfly-like creature and the beginning of an incredibly long flying sequence begins. Mean Eugene attacks in a helicopter with rockets, but is finally defeated for good and Chester grabs the final part of his motorcycle.  </div>  <div> Power-ups : There are a number of items that can be grabbed that help Chester in his muffler-hunting quest.Cheetah Paw: This health restoring item resembles one of the cheeto paw snakes that were in production in the early nineties. This is surprisingly the only possible reference to cheetos in the game.Sunglasses: Although Chester is always wearing sunglasses, he can grab this additional pair to turn the screen monochrome and reveal hidden badges.Guitar: This guitar will make Chester invulnerable as he rocks out. The problem with this item is that it relinquishes control from the player as Chester stands in one spot and takes a few hops to the left and right. In one stage grabbing the guitar will cause Chester to jump off the platform he is on and get damaged by water.Sneakers: These give Chester the ability to dash by holding down a button. When dashing Chester can jump a considerable distance. Until the Chester gets these he can only walk at a pace that should make him ashamed to call himself a cheetah.Skateboards: The skateboard will bring Chester to the bonus stage. In the bonus stage Chester rides the motor powered skateboard to collect as many badges as possible.Paw Badges: The standard  collectible. Get one hundred and get an extra life.  </div>  <div> Manual :  Don't walk, run! To buy some Cheetos brand corn snacks!Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool comes with a gem of a manual. Not only is it filled with  Engrish, but the writers have attempted to have every line rhyme. This leads to sentences such as ""Good gain by swipin' the motorcycle frame!"" and ""If you're hip and brave enough, check out these Hidden Caves and stuff.""The manual also has a coupon for 50 cents off a bag of paw shaped Cheetos. The coupon expires 12/31/93. </div> "

Like the first, Too Cool to Fool, Wild Wild West is a side-scrolling platformer that pits Chester Cheetah against his old nemesis Mean Eugene the zookeeper as well as various other less-than-cool humans and animals. He can collect one-use items that will help him survive, and the player can determine which stage he visits next via a map of the USA. </div>  <div> Story : Well, it finally happened. Chester Cheetah escaped captivity at the zoo and was cruising down the road on his awesome motorcycle following his map to Hip City. Suddenly, Mean Eugene stole his map, ripped it to pieces, and scattered them across the United States. He needs to recover all the pieces by travelling the breadth of the continent, avoiding Mean Eugene all the while. Because, after all...it's not easy being cheesy. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chester on the way to 7-Eleven for some CheetosThe gameplay in Wild Wild Quest is fairly different than its prequel. The mechanics and sprites are completely redone and, in most cases, of much higher quality. For example, the artists went through the trouble to put shading on things.Now that he's out of the zoo Chester has decided to add a bit of pep to his walk and goes at about twice the speed that he did in Too Cool to Fool. Chester can also dash without the need for a power-up and perform super jumps. Chester is a fragile kitty though and will die after one hit if he isn't carrying a bag of Cheetos Brand Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks. </div>  <div> Levels : Levels are selected from a level select screen modeled on a US map. The player chooses a starting level and from there can choose from the level to the left or right of the level they just played.In each level Chester must find the map piece before the timer runs out. Once the map piece is found Chester has to find his way to the ""GOAL"" sign at the end of the level. Each level has a bizarre boss fight after the player reaches the goal.Euphreaka: Located in Northern California this beachy level is filled with palm trees, vultures and a very angry fat beach lady.Quakers-Field: This Californian town is filled with orchards, junked cars and buildings of questionable sturdiness.Omahog: A farm level based in Nebraska.Lostin: This town in Massachusetts is filled to the brim with water, pirates and ships.Numb: Chester makes his way up north to Alaska to slide around on the ice and enjoy the auroras.Wall Up: New Mexico's finest sombrero'd cacti watch as Chester runs through this desert.Little Shock: Chester must navigate his way through this power plant in the heart of Arkansas.Un-Clearwater: Will Florida's swamps thwart Chester's need for a map piece?Not-So-Great-Falls: Lots of hyphens don't keep this mountainous Montana level down.Rally: Once Chester gets all of the map pieces he makes his way to North Carolina to beat Mean Eugene in a NASCAR race. This is less of a level and more of a final boss stage. </div>  <div> Collectibles : It's almost like this game is an ad for Cheetos or something...Cheeto Paw: Levels are filled with Cheeto paws of all sizes. Although they are counted, they don't give you any extra lives, just lots of points.Bag of Cheetos: Unlike Too Cool to Fool, this game actually contains Cheetos. If Chester is carrying a bag of these he won't die when he gets hit by an enemy.Map Piece: One in each level, Chester needs this to finish a level.Friend Icon: There are several icons in each level representing one of Chester's animal friends. They give you points. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores 6,9,8,8 stating, ""...Great animations, especially the guitar playing, along with a decent quest and a lot of different levels to keep the game rockin'. A definite winner"". </div> "

Chrono Trigger,Square,Square,"August 11, 1995",snes,"Take control of the lovable but silent protagonist Crono in this time-spanning collaborative effort from Squaresoft's ""Dream Team."" Chrono Trigger follows the exploits of Crono as he and his friends attempt to save the world from a planet-devouring alien creature.",3030-9249,9249,0,1995-03-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/chrono-trigger/3030-9249/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Chrono Trigger is a traditional console role-playing game (RPG) released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 22, 1995 in North America and for the Super Famicom on March 11, 1995 in Japan. The game is well-known for its multiple endings, Active Time Battle system, and time-spanning storyline. Before its release, Chrono Trigger was a highly anticipated collaboration between Squaresoft and freelance members of Enix. The development team was comprised of the same minds behind the popular RPGs Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, earning them the moniker of ""The Dream Team."" The game has sold around 3.5 million copies worldwide across its various ports.At the time of its release, Chrono Trigger received great praise from critics and fans. Due to the game's multiple endings, story, music (by famed Final Fantasy composers Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda), battle system, and detailed graphics, the game was so popular it sold two million copies within the first two months of release. Chrono Trigger has since been hailed as one of the greatest games of all time by various popular gaming websites and magazines (placing in the top 100 of IGN, GameSpot, and Famitsu's best games of all time features). Metacritic lists the Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger with a 92% or ""universal acclaim."" </div>  <div> Development : The development of Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between several influential figures in Japanese game development, including Hironobu Sakaguchi (creator of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series), Yuji Horii (creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series), Nobuo Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series), Yasunori Mitsuda (composer for Chrono Trigger), and Akira Toriyama (creator of the Dragon Ball series and longtime contributor to the Dragon Quest franchise).Chrono Trigger was produced by Kazuhiko Aoki and directed by Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Yuji Horii assisted Hironobu Sakaguchi in the supervision of the game. Yuji Horii, being a large fan of time travel, decided to center the game's plot around time travel. Masato Kato then edited and revised the storyline, and in the process created the idea of multiple endings. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita also assisted in the writing of the script. Other designers working on the game include Tetsuya Takahashi, Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora.Hironobu Sakaguchi has talked about the development process of Chrono Trigger in a positive light. He cited humorous scenes in the game that he said would not be possible in a Final Fantasy game. He also referred to the development of Chrono Trigger as ""playing in Toriyama's universe."" Toriyama had a large influence on the game development. For example, when Squaresoft requested a playable animal character in the game, the team based Frog off of one of Toriyama's sketches.As the game was being developed certain elements were modified from their original designs and ultimately turned into well known parts of the story. When game testers complained about the difficulty and non-linearity of the game, the team added the End of Time so that players could get hints in relation to the next goal. Some of the novel features of the game also proved to be new challenges for the development team, which necessitated extra attention. Sakaguchi required the beta testers to play through the game twice, to confirm that the New Game Plus feature worked.The Famicom and Super Nintendo versions of Chrono Trigger both utilized 32 megabit cartridges that had RAM and battery backup for saving games. As the Japanese and North American versions of the game were developed on different schedules, they do contain some oddities. For example, the Japanese version contains art for the ending of the game and a running count of the amount of items in the player's inventory, and the North American version still contains an unused song for the unfinished Singing Mountain dungeon. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ted Woolsey (an influential figure in translation) was asked to localize the game for North America in only thirty days. He didn't have a modern translation team, so to get the context of the game he had to memorize certain scenarios and read drafts of player's guides to get a feel for the game. Despite these facts, Ted Woolsey still said that this was one of his favorite games to translate.Localization for the North American market changed many things, mostly due to Nintendo of America's stricter standards at the time. References to breastfeeding, alcohol (changed to soda in the North American version), religion, and homosexuality (in the case of Flea, a character who looks physically like a woman but is in reality a man) were either simplified or removed from the game entirely. Localization also changed many of the main characters' names. There are a variety of possible reasons as to why this happened, perhaps because the Japanese names did not sound exotic enough. In the case of a few names, however, there was not enough space for the name to fit using English letters as opposed to Japanese characters. </div>  <div> Plot : According to Hiromichi Tanaka in 2011 and 2013, Chrono Trigger was originally planned to be what eventually became Secret of Mana, which itself was originally intended to be Final Fantasy IV and was produced by the team behind Final Fantasy III (Hiromichi Tanaka and Nasir Gebelli). In Tanaka's own words:After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore… Instead, it was eventually released as “Seiken Densetsu 2″ (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as “Chrono Trigger”. (laugh)At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.  </div>  <div> Endings : Chrono Trigger takes influence from many elements of traditional Japanese RPG gameplay while abandoning others. For example, it borrows familiar concepts from earlier Final Fantasy games, such as menu and turn based combat, but largely eliminates the RPG staple of random enemy encounters, instead allowing players to view enemies in the field making it possible to avoid many conflicts all together.Another difference from previous RPGs is that actual battles do not occur on the overworld map. In Chrono Trigger battles occur in smaller exploration areas or dungeons where enemies are displayed in the environment. Aside from making encounters optional, having enemies onscreen also helps create a smoother battle transition since the characters will take battle formation in the onscreen environment instead of the game fading to a separate battle screen. The overworld serves to connect these areas with other places of interest such as town. Towns, as is usual in RPGs, contain areas where the party can rest or purchase items, weapons, and armor.Chrono Trigger was the first game to coin the term ""New Game Plus,"" though the actual concept had appeared in other games dating back to the original Legend of Zelda. After completing the game, a player can create a New Game Plus allowing him or her to retain all equipment, levels, and Techs (this game's version of special abilities.) New Game Plus also allows the player to fight Lavos, the final boss of the game, much earlier in the storyline, which is how the game's multiple endings can be unlocked.The time travel aspect of Chrono Trigger transcends story purposes, affecting gameplay as well. Different periods of time become accessible during certain parts of the game. These eras can then be accessed through time portals or (later in the game) through a time traveling device that the party dubs ""Epoch."" Epoch can travel to any time period instantaneously, while the time portals can only lead the player to certain areas in a time period. Side-quests available in the past time periods of the game can influence events in future areas. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Chrono Trigger utilizes the Active Time Battle system, a battle system popularized by the Final Fantasy series. Each character has a bar which scrolls across based on the character's speed. Once the bar is filled, it is that character's turn.Unlike many Japanese role-playing games, there is no transition to a separate battle screen when the party encounters enemies. Instead, when a fight begins, a battle menu simply appears on the current area being traversed by the party (which can be moved between the top and the bottom of the screen). Enemies and characters aren't locked to a single grid either, as they move around the area fluidly. Depending on how the enemies and characters are placed on the field, some attacks have more effectiveness than others (for example, attacks that hit enemies grouped together).In combat, there are three options: Attack, Item, and Tech. Attacking has the character doling out a physical attack. Items are accesible through the second option, providing buffs and healing items. Techs are special abilities that each character can use, both magical and non-magical. Each character has a base magic ability, with abilities such as Water, Lightning, or Shadow (with the exception of Robo, who is a robot and Ayla, who was born before the creation of magic). In addition to individual (or Single) Techs, there are also Double and Triple Techs which involve two and three party members, respectively. Learning a Double or Triple Tech is dependent on which Single Techs the individuals involved have learned. The Double and Triple Techs cost each party member involved a corresponding amount of MP. </div>  <div> Additional Characters : The element of the game which makes it stand out from other RPG's of the time is the tech system. The techs work like standard magic or skills in any other RPG, however Chrono Trigger puts its own spin on things. First off, as opposed to a Final Fantasy where there are dozens of magic options for each character, in Chrono Trigger each character has 10 individual techs which are usually unique to them and their element. These are just solo techs however, a huge element of the battles are the dual and triple techs.To unlock regular techs in the game each battle rewards the player with 3 basic things, money, experience, and tech points. Each character has their own standard of tech points that they need to reach to unlock the next solo tech. Learning dual and triple techs is done completely differently.Dual and triple techs are techs that need either two or three party members turns to be ready. This is generally a strong move where each character performs a version of one of their own solo techs but they combine it with the other party members involved. These techs generally cost a lot of MP and have the added con of using multiple members turns at the same time for one attack.Dual and triple techs are unlocked after playing one battle with the duo or trio in question after they have unlocked the single tech that they perform.When the player begins their journey the first thing they are prompted to do is choose between Active mode and Wait mode. Active mode is the traditional mode which is meant to make the player feel like they are in a rush during battles. During this mode every character has their own ATB bar while the enemies have their own invisible one. When the player is selecting whatever options they want the enemy can attack them at all times.In Wait mode the players characters can be attacked while they are waiting, however once they enter any combat menu the enemies actions freeze completely. This is an easier mode which gives the player some time to think about their actions. </div>  <div> Other Versions and Sequels : Chrono Trigger takes place in the kingdom of Guardia throughout several different ages, primarily 1000 AD. The game opens with Crono, the game's protagnist, waking up on the day of the Millennial Fair. At the fair, Crono meets Marle, a mysterious and bubbly girl who ends up being teleported to the past after a mishap with a time machine. Crono decides to travel back in time as well and try to save her.Crono quickly finds that he has been teleported to the year 400 AD. This is an era in which the kingdom of Guardia is at perpetual war with the forces of an evil and powerful sorcerer named Magus.Upon visiting Guardia Castle, he finds Marle posing as this era's queen, Queen Leene. Unfortunately, their reunion is short-lived, as Marle vanishes suddenly after revealing her identity. On the way out of the castle, Crono finds Lucca, the time machine's inventor and a close friend of Crono, who has also traveled to 400 AD to see how she can help. Lucca tells Crono how Marle is actually the princess in 1000 AD, and that Queen Leene is her ancestor. When the castle guards found Marle, they stopped the search for Leene, essentially guaranteeing her death and ending her line.Crono and Lucca venture to a cathedral inhabited by monsters disguised as nuns. There, they meet Frog (who is actually Glenn, a knight who Magus turned into an amphibian), and manage to save the real queen as well as the chancellor. This fixes the timeline, and Crono and Lucca return home with Marle using a new device created by Lucca, the ""gate key,"" which stabilizes temporal vortexes and allows the party to traverse time using pre-existing ""gates.""Back in 1000 AD, Crono decides to escort Marle back to the castle. There, Crono is put on trial for allegedly kidnapping the princess and attempting to usurp power from the throne. No matter what the player does at this point in the game, Crono is convicted and thrown into prison.The player can break out on their own or wait for the execution (in the latter case, Lucca saves Crono at the last moment). The duo battle their way out of the prison, meeting up with Marle, who decides to flee with them. The party finds a portal in Guardia Forest. Cornered, and despite Lucca's protests that they don't know where the gate leads, the group enters the portal.The party ends up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in 2300 AD, and quickly discover an information center which gives them the location of another gate. The archive also has visual record of ""AD 1999: The Day of Lavos."" The video shows a gigantic monster emerging from the ground and destroying the world.The party decides to change the future by defeating Lavos in their own time.In another building, the group discovers a broken robot. Lucca decides to repair it, and Marle and Crono name him Robo. He repays the group by escorting them to the gate, located in ""Proto Dome,"" and by helping the group fight off a group of defective robots bent on the destruction of humans.The gate in Proto Dome takes the party to a hub world known as the End of Time, occupied by Gaspar. Gaspar informs the group that all lost time travelers end up there. The party also meets Spekkio, Master of War, who teaches all the human characters magic.The party learns Magus tried to summon Lavos in 600 AD, but a legendary hero (supposedly Frog) stopped him. The legend says that he wielded a blade called the Masamune that they find broken. The only smith who could fix such a blade would be Melchior, an eccentric old man who lives outside a village of Mystics, the followers of Magus, in the year 1000 AD. After coming to him with the sword, he tells them that he needs a substance known as Dreamstone to repair it, and that such a rare stone only comes from millions of years in the past.The group travels to 65,000,000 BC, where they meet Ayla, a prehistoric human who saves the group from a group of hostile reptiles known as Reptites. Ayla agrees to give Crono a Dreamstone if he can beat her in a drinking contest. Crono wins the contest, and they all pass out. When they wake up, their gate key is gone, stolen by Ayla's jealous friend Kino. The party navigates through a jungle maze to get the key back, ultimately encountering (and chasing away) Azala, the ruler of the Reptites. During this encounter, the party learns about the advanced intelligence of the Reptites, compared to the still-primitive, barbaric human race.They travel back to 1000 AD, and visit Melchior, who willingly repairs the Masamune. Crono and company then go back to 600 AD to find Frog, who believes he is unworthy to wield the legendary blade. After some convincing, he agrees, even traveling to the End of Time to learn magic. The party enters Magus' lair, and encounter his three generals: Ozzie (the Trickster General), Flea (the transgendered magician), and Slash (the inhumanly quick swordsman extraordinaire), all of whom the party handily defeats.They then face off with Magus, who they believe is in the process of creating Lavos with a powerful spell. Magus recognizes Frog but shows no fear in the face of the Masamune. The party defeats the sorcerer, causing his spell to go awry--Magus then reveals that he was not creating Lavos but merely summoning it so that he could defeat it. The incident causes a massive time gate that sucks the party into 65,000,000 BC.Here, they meet up with Ayla again, and decide to help her destroy the Reptites, ending the war between them and the humans. After reaching the top of the fortress, it turns out Azala is waiting for an omen that will supposedly bring victory to the Reptite horde. The party is forced to battle Azala and her pet, a massive black tyrannosaurus rex. The group is victorious, and the omen turns out to be Lavos falling to the earth from space. Only Azala recognizes it for what it is: the end of the future.Crono and friends then travel to a huge kingdom of magic in 12,000 BC. The Kingdom of Zeal is a huge floating continent where humans practice magic, a long-lost technique by the time Frog's era comes around. The people of Zeal are getting all their power through the Mammon Machine, a machine that extracts Lavos' energy for their own good. While exploring Zeal, the party meets a mysterious prophet, who warns Queen Zeal about Crono's plans. A young boy also tells the party, ""One among you will shortly perish.""The queen exiles the party to the ground of the world, which is experiencing an Ice Age brought on by Lavos' crash-landing so many years ago. When the group finally gets back to the End of Time, the old man tells them of a machine called the Wings of Time. They journey back to 2300 AD and find the device, a large flying machine which they christen Epoch.The party travels back to Zeal intent on destroying the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace. They arrive too late, however, and Lavos then awakens. The prophet is revealed to be Magus, who attempts to destroy Lavos but is batted aside effortlessly. Lavos stuns everyone, but Crono pulls himself to his feet. He hurls himself at Lavos, but is instantly vaporized. The rest of the party wakes up in a hut on the ground of the world, which is where non-magic users have lived. During the confusion, an advisor to Queen Zeal named Dalton has stolen the Wings of Time (now the ""Aero Dalton Imperial""), and has declared himself ruler of the world.When Frog wakes up, he goes outside and confronts Magus, who cursed him in the first place. Magus, for his part, is cocky, even insulting Crono and calling him weak for trying to stop Lavos. The player is given a choice: let Magus live or kill him and break the curse on Frog. If the player lets him live, he joins the party. The party goes to defeat Dalton, who imprisons them and requires a daring break-out, before being easily defeated. At the end of time, it is revealed that Magus was the mysterious prophet, and he only wanted to summon Lavos to kill it. It is revealed that the old man is a Guru named Gaspar. He informs the party of an egg called the Chrono Trigger, which they can use to resurrect Crono.At this point in the game, it is up to the player to save Crono or not. The main story is technically over aside from the final confrontation, a series of optional side quests open up, and resurrecting Crono is optional.If the player decides to revive Crono, Gaspar suggests that they visit Belthasar in 2300 AD. He knows the secret to bringing someone back from the dead. Belthasar tells them that Death Peak (also located in 2300 AD) is the key to reviving their downed comrade. However, there are two requirements: the need for Crono needs to be incredibly great and they will need an exact replica of him (which can be obtained from a magician in 1000 AD). After getting the replica, and visiting the top of Death Peak, Crono can be revived.Naturally, only one ending is considered canon. In this ending, the party reaches Lavos and manages to destroy its outer protective shell (either through fighting or crashing Epoch into it). Here, it is revealed that Lavos has been using the planet by harvesting DNA to control its evolution. It then proceeds to take on a final form, which is quickly destroyed by the team.The game then goes to a celebratory traditional ending at the end of the Millennial Fair. Crono and his friends all say goodbye and return to their respective eras via the time gates. If the player has Magus at this point, he leaves to search for his long-lost sister Schala. Depending on what the player did to penetrate Lavos' outer shell, Crono's mom either jumps into the time gate by accident (prompting the remaining party to go search for her) or Marle assists her father in hanging up Nadia's bell and accidentally getting carried away by some balloons (although she is saved by Crono). </div>  <div> Fan Remakes, Rom Hacks, and Rereleases : There are a total of twelve endings in the original release of Chrono Trigger, with an extra variant for the last two endings, adding up to a technical total of fourteen. The PlayStation re-release added an extra two animated endings, bringing the total to sixteen. The DS re-release then added another extra ending, bringing the new total to seventeen endings. </div> "

Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game. </div> "
Sid Meier's Civilization V,Microprose,Koei,"June 30, 1995",snes,"Civilization V brings brand new gameplay elements to this beloved franchise, while maintaining the ""just one more turn"" mentality.",3030-30057,30057,0,2010-09-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v/3030-30057/,ESRB: E10+," <div> Overview : Civilization V is the latest game in the Civilization franchise, developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games. It was released on September 21, 2010 on the PC, and November 23, 2010 on the Mac. It makes a significant departure from the previous games in the franchise, adopting a hexagonal grid (instead of a square grid), and limiting units to one per tile. Some gameplay elements from Civilization IV, like religion and espionage, have been removed, while new elements like city states and limited strategic resources were added.Gods & Kings, an expansion pack, was released on June 19, 2012 in America, and June 22, 2012 worldwide. It adds 9 new civilizations, 3 new scenarios, as well as religion and espionage in the game. The second expansion, Brave New World, was released on July 9, 2013 in America, and July 12 worldwide. It revamps the Cultural and Diplomatic victories, and adds new trade route mechanics. This wikipage is reflective of the mechanics as employed in the base game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Hex Grid in ActionIn Civilization V, the player chooses a civilization and manages its cities and units, trying to achieve victory. The game usually begins in the Stone Age, although players can choose a pre-determined age to start off from, and will progress through the ages to the Future Era. Throughout the game, the player will encounter other civilizations, and can form relations and become strong allies, or crush them to smithereens. Players can win through having the highest score, capturing all enemy capitals, being the first to reach Alpha Centauri, winning the United Nations vote, or even being the most culturally affluent of all the civilizations and building the Utopia Project. </div>  <div> Civilizations : Ranged CombatThe combat system has been completely overhauled in Civilization V. Unit stacking from previous games has been removed, replaced with a one military unit-per-tile system. Ranged units also make a return to the franchise. They can attack units from a distance, allowing them to take potshots at invading armies. However, they are weak in melee combat and require good positioning or a melee defender to avoid from being destroyed.Sieges in Civilization V are different from the previous games, as cities are now able to defend themselves. All cities possess hit points--if this reaches zero, the city will fall under the attacker's control. Garrisoning units and building defensive buildings will increase a city's defense rating. Cities can also fire at sieging units, softening them up for a counterattack. After a city has been conquered, it can be: razed, annexed, or transformed into a puppet state.Naval movement and combat has also been changed, as any land unit can ""embark"", entering a water tile and automatically turning into a transport ship. Embarked units are defenseless, and will require protection from enemy vessels. All ships are ranged units in Civilization V, although Gods & Kings adds melee naval units that can take cities. Ships can also blockade trade routes and bombard cities and units on land. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The City ScreenBuilding a city is one of the pillars of Civilization gameplay, and cities can be settled by settler units in any suitable place on the world map. City boundaries can grow, one tile at a time, to a maximum of 3 tiles outwards, favoring food oriented tiles like grasslands over production based tiles like forests. The player can also buy specific tiles, speeding up the rate at which a city expands. Cities generate production, money, culture, and science for their civilization, and players can choose which building they wish to build and what units they wish to train. </div>  <div> Special Editions : City-states are one city civilizations controlled by AI, unable to expand, and cannot win the game. There are 3 types of city-states - Cultured, Maritime and Militaristic - each providing culture points, food, and military units respectively. Civilizations will have to vie for influence over the city-states, performing quests for them or giving them monetary gifts. Being friendly with a city state provides bonuses based on the type, and allying with one will provide a greater amount of bonus. Gods & Kings adds 2 more types of city-states: Religious and Mercantile.The United NationsA city-state can only ally itself with one civilization at a time. That city-state will provide all its resources to its ally, and will join its ally in war. It will also vote its ally in the United Nations, for the Diplomatic Victory. If a city-state is conquered by a civilization but then liberated by another, it will also vote for the liberator in the United Nations. Some examples of city-states in the game are Singapore, Rio de Janeiro, and Venice. </div>  <div> Gods & Kings : Social Policy TreesSocial Policies replaces Civics from Civilization IV, and are civilization-wide bonuses that are unlocked with enough culture points. There are 10 Social Policy trees - each with 5 policies, opener, and finisher abilities - and are unlocked in various eras. Some policy branches are mutually exclusive. Players can still switch to a conflicting branch, but only at the expense of all the policies of the previous one, and a period of anarchy. If 5 trees are fully completed, the Utopia project is unlocked, allowing for Cultural Victory to be achieved. The 10 social policies are, as follows: Liberty, Tradition, Honor, Piety, Patronage, Commerce, Rationalism, Freedom, Autocracy and Order. </div>  <div> Brave New World : Scientific VictoryScience is an important part of Civilization V, as it controls how fast technology is unlocked. Science is generated at 1 per population unit, and can be increased through scientific buildings, science specialists, or Social Policies. Trading technologies between civilizations has also been removed. Instead, two civilizations can enter a research agreement (for a nominal sum) where they work together to provide a huge boost to their research. But if they go to war, the agreement is cancelled.A civilization's economy is reflected by the amount of gold they generate. Gold can be used in a vast array of things, from the maintenance of units, buildings, and roads, to buying and upgrading units. Gold can also be used in diplomacy to improve relations with other civilizations or city states, or used as a bartering tool. Gold is generated from tiles such as coastlines or rivers, and the trading post improvement can be built to generate further income. Luxury resources, trade routes, pillaging tiles, capturing cities, and disbanding extra units will also provide gold. </div>  <div> Steam Integration : Happiness is a factor that determines how willing a civilization's citizen are to work and cooperate with their leader, and how well they fight in their armies. Unlike previous games, happiness is now a civilization-wide value. The larger a civilization gets, the more unhappy their citizens become. The number of cities in a civilization and the population of those cities negatively affect happiness, and annexed cities compound the issue. If unhappiness is not resolved, rebel units will eventually rise up in the civilization's territory and attack the civilization.Happiness is generated through the presence of luxury resources, the construction of entertainment buildings, and the discovery of Natural Wonders throughout the world. Several Social Policies and Wonders also help to alleviate unhappiness. Positive happiness will eventually build up into a Golden Age for a civilization, granting them additional gold and production (and culture in Gods & Kings) for 10 turns. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Great People are special units generated by Great People points. These units can build a special Great Person tile improvement, activate a special action unique to that type of Great People, or can be used to generate a short Golden Age. Great People points are generated from their corresponding specialists and from certain Wonders, except Great Generals, who gain points from land combat.NameActivated AbilityTile ImprovementGreat ArtistCulture Bomb: Tiles around the Great Artist immediately belong to the civilization, regardless of previous ownerLandmark: +6 CultureGreat EngineerHurry Production: Provides a great amount of production to the building or Wonder in the city's queueManufactory: +4 Production, +5 with ChemistryGreat GeneralCombat Boost (passive): Increases the combat ability of land units within 2 tiles of the Great GeneralCitadel: Defensive boost, 3 damage to enemies around itGreat MerchantConduct Trade Mission: Grants a large amount of gold and boosts city state influenceCustoms House: +4 Gold, +6 with EconomicsGreat ScientistDiscover Technology: Instantly discover any technologyAcademy: +6 Science, +8 with Scientific Theory </div>  <div> Useful Links : There are 3 types of resources in Civilization V: strategic resources, luxury resources, and bonus resources. Strategic resources unlock different units and buildings that rely on them, such as Iron for Swordsmen. These resources can be acquired by building the appropriate improvement upon them like mine or a well. Strategic resources had a huge overhaul in Civilization V, and there are now limited quantities of a resource per source. If the source is depleted no further units or buildings that require that resource can be built. In addition, if a civilization loses the resource, their units will suffer a severe combat penalty. The strategic resources are: horses, iron, coal, oil, aluminum, and uranium.Luxury resources are rare resources like spices, whales, or gems. These resources often provide gold boost to the tile it is on, and more importantly, happiness to a civilization. Each unique luxury resource a civilization holds grants it 4 happiness points, and extra luxuries can be traded for gold or more luxuries. Additional luxury resources, such as citrus and truffles, were added in Gods & Kings.Bonus resources like cows or fish can help a civilization grow bigger. These types of resources provide additional food or production to tile, and can be improved by tile improvements. A city working a tile with the bonus resource will get the full benefit of that resource, and many bonus resources can be further improved with specific buildings. </div> "

When his girlfriend Congette (Ai-Ai in the Japanese version) becomes abducted by a demon kid, Congo ventures out through various prehistoric locales to rescue her.While it includes similar platforming to the original Caveman Ninja, Congo's Caper focuses less on weapon power-ups and more on the protagonist's agility, as Congo can perform superhuman high jumps, slide down slopes (eventually rolling along the ground, even up walls and through enemies), and dive into foes from the air. Rather than a standard health system, Congo collects Rubies to upgrade his form (allowing him to become the powered-up Super Congo under the right conditions) and can downgrade by getting hit (down to his fragile monkey form). The game also features a slot machine mechanic, where picking up Sapphires causes a slot machine to spin for potential extra lives, and a currency system (Diamonds, which are used to earn extra lives similar to coins in Super Mario Bros.).The game later received a sequel, titled Joe & Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics, that focuses the game back to the formula of the original Caveman Ninja. It was later digitally re-released for the Nintendo Switch via the Nintendo Switch Online service outside of Japan on May 26, 2022. </div> "
Contra III: The Alien Wars,Konami,Konami,"April 6, 1992",snes,Players control either Jimbo or Sully as they destroy aliens in this fast-paced shooter.,3030-3016,3016,0,1992-02-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/,CERO: A," <div> Overview : Contra III: The Alien Wars (Contra Spirits in Japan and Super Probotector: Alien Rebels in Europe) is a 1992 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game developed and published by Konami. It is the third console iteration of Contra, hence the title ""Contra III"". Originally, Contra Force was planned to be released first, but it ended up being released afterward.  In 1994, the game was ported to the Game Boy by Factor 5. It featured numerous differences, such as the removal of the ability to hold two weapons simultaneously. In 2002, the game was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX. The two top-down levels were cut out and replaced with stages from Contra: Hard Corps. The game was also ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. Contra III: The Alien Wars is also one of the few games to be on the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games.In the game's story, the year is 2636. Aliens are once again invading, so it's up to Bill Rizer and Lance Bean to beat sweet justice into the aliens. In the American version of the game, Bill and Lance are named Jimbo and Sully. Since the original NES Contra games take place in modern times, Jimbo and Sully are explained to be Bill and Lance's descendants. In the European version of the game, they were considered cyborgs named RD008 and RC011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A mutated turtle creature, and the first bossContra III: The Alien Wars is a traditional Contra title. It has fast-paced, gritty, old-school action. Contra III is the first game in the Contra series to allow the player to hold two weapons, making it a landmark title in the franchise. In addition to that change, the power of the Super Nintendo allowed for larger, more detailed sprites and much more complex level design. Players can now jump on bars and climb on them monkey-bar style, climb walls and ladders, destroy various objects (such as the car right in front of the player in the very first level), and vehicles (such as a tank in the first level). New levels include one in which the player must jump between missiles while destroying an enemy ship, riding on a motorcycle while speeding down a road, riding on a jet ski, and two Mode 7 top-down levels.In the Mode 7 levels, the player controls the view using the two shoulder buttons (R and L). By pressing these buttons, the camera rotates around. At the start of the stage, the player gets to choose where to be dropped in. Navigating around the area and destroying various targets eventually leads the player to a boss, which must be disposed of in a fashion similar to the 2D side-scrolling bosses. </div>  <div> Weapons : If the Contra series has been known for anything, it's the wide variety of weapon power-ups available to the player. The letter next to each weapon in parenthesis detonates which lettered power-up awards the weapon to the player. By tapping the X button (standard controls), the player can swap between two weapon slots. If killed, only the weapon in the current slot will be taken away from the player as a penalty. Note that tapping X while shooting will rapidly switch weapons, allowing the player to fire anything twice as fast (within the physical limits of the player in question). Also, holding both shoulder buttons and pressing fire will result in a spinning attack with both equipped weapons being fired 360 degrees.Machine Gun (N/A) - The starting weapon of Contra III. Has a high rate of fire, but only shoots in one direction and has very low damage.Spread Shot (S) - Essentially the shotgun of the game. Fires out five weak shots that shoot out in five directions in front of the shooter. Excellent for clearing out crowds of foes and does good damage to bosses at close range. Not nearly as overpowered as in previous games in the series.Homing Missiles (H) - Weak missiles that seek out enemy targets.Laser (L) - A powerful gun that fires out one shot in side-scrolling levels, but turns into a continuous beam when in a top-down level. Takes down bosses with great speed.Shield (B) - Gives the player temporary invincibility to everything except for falling off the screen.Bomb (has the appearance of a bomb) - Sends out a circular wave of destruction that slowly spreads over the entire screen. Damages bosses and will instantly destroy most normal enemies. After each death, players will respawn with one bomb, and more can be obtained as weapon pickups.Crush Missile (C) - With the exception of the bomb, the strongest weapon in the game. It has short range, but incredible splash damage to compensate. When paired with another Crush Missile, it can take down bosses faster than any other weapon.Flame (F) - A flamethrower. Short range but can pass through barriers, making it ideal for certain situations. Also, when holding the fire button and switching the direction of fire, the flame will move in a waving pattern instead of snapping to the new direction like other weapons, providing a wider range of fire. </div>  <div> Mode 7 : Contra III: The Alien Wars made use of the Mode 7 graphics mode of the Super Nintendo throughout the game. An example of its use within the game is within the first stage as the low-flying plane which appears mid-stage forms part of the background layer and is animated using Mode 7 (as it comes towards the player its size increases while its wings bank slightly). The bombs which it drops however are sprites.A second example would be the turtle boss at the end of the first stage which also sits in the background but its moving legs and the bullets that it fires are sprites. </div> "

As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of ""spots"" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. ""Spots"" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game. </div> "

It is the third game in the series chronologically. Like the rest of the series, the game has multiple branching paths and aquatic-themed bosses, often resembling sea creatures like angler fish and hermit crabs.Darius Twin was followed by another Super Famicom/SNES exclusive game in the Darius series, 1993's Darius Force. Darius Force is known as Super Nova in the US.  </div>  <div> Story : Darius Twin takes place sometime after the events of  Darius II (known as Sagaia outside of Japan). Darius, the home planet of the Darius series, has been taken over by an alien race, the Belser and their alliance, who have ruthlessly conquered parts of the galaxy in aquatic-themed spaceships. The player's job is to pilot a 'silver hawk' fighter craft, making their way back to Darius, and free it from the Belser. Depending on the path taken, and whether or not the player is successful at the task, there are five different endings that can be attained. While they differ in how thoroughly the player has managed in driving off the Belser, in all of them it's apparent that the player will be called back into action against some foe sooner rather than later.This game does not depend much on the storyline. The only reference to the story seen is in the intro before the title screen and in the outro screens at the various endings. </div>  <div> Planets : Planet select screen.In Darius Twin each game level (called ""rounds"" in-game) represents a planet that is being cleared of the Belser forces on the way to liberating the home planet of Darius. Every time a round is cleared, a screen displaying 12 planets arranged broadly in the shape of a fish is shown. The player has the option of 12 different paths through these, meaning that one playthrough requires only seven rounds.The choice of path can affect what enemies will be faced, what upgrades will be received, and also which ending will be seen. The following table gives an overview of what upgrades are to be found on which levels, and where mini-boss fights are faced.PlanetA: OrcaWeaponShieldMini-BossBombShieldWeaponBombBomb    B: DantoWeaponBombMini-BossScreen Kill        C: KolodaShieldBombMini-Boss         D: LankusBombShieldWeapon SwitchBombBombBombShieldShield    E: PadiShieldExtra LifeShieldBombMini-Boss*Screen Kill*WeaponShieldWeaponBombBombShieldF: RearWeaponMini-BossWeapon*ShieldShieldBombExtra LifeBombShield   G: NarakiniWeaponMini-BossBombShieldShieldShield      H: SabiaBombShieldShieldBombShieldMini-BossShieldShieldWeaponWeapon  I: KarudoShieldShieldScreen KillWeaponWeaponMini-Boss      J: NoemuWeapon*ShieldWeapon SwitchExtra LifeShieldScreen KillShield     K: HorolainWeapon SwitchShieldShieldScreen Kill*ShieldExtra LifeBomb     L: Darius            * Denotes a random encounterWeapon upgrades are red, bombs green, shields blue, extra lives are orange, screen kill yellow, and finally, weapon switches are red octagons (as opposed to cubes).""Weapon Switch"" upgrades is where the type of weapon the ship has is changed. Getting two of these would revert the ship's weapons back to the original type, and is not recommended. ""Screen Kill"" is an upgrade that. When activated, it destroys all the regular enemies on screen and deals a large amount of damage to mini-bosses.The final level, Darius, has no upgrades, only a series of repeated encounters with the mini-bosses from the other levels. </div>  <div> Upgrades : A blue (shield) and yellow (screen kill) upgrade among some enemies.Multiple upgrades are available in all planets/levels. To upgrade, the player must break a special cube container, which appears in packs of six. The sixth container will reveal a crystal that will yield an upgrade. The color and shape of the crystal will determine the kind of upgrade will be received. In typical arcade-game style, the upgrades appear mixed into the action, and it is entirely possible to miss them while fighting off the waves of enemies that appear along with them. This is an integral part of the gameplay of Darius Twin, with a lot of the challenge consisting in making use of the upgrades when available and, in co-operative mode, distributing them in the best way between the two ships. </div>  <div> Cooperative Multiplayer : The red upgrades that are collected change the weapons available to the player. When the game begins, the player has small orange lasers and, depending on what upgrades are chosen, the player may end up with the big white fireballs or the more powerful wave weapon that also cuts through all enemies and obstacles. Each new upgrade increases the damage dealt and changes the look of the weapon's shots.The red octagon switches weapon type.

As was the case with the series' previous titles, Gargoyle's Quest and Gargoyle's Quest II: The Demon Darkness, Demon's Crest is a side-scrolling platform game which places players in the role of the anti-hero Firebrand, a member of the very same Red Arremer demon clan often found antagonizing the valiant Arthur in the Ghost 'n Goblin franchise. Its gameplay utilizes mechanics commonly seen in Metroidvania action-adventure games, such as areas which are inaccessible until later upgrades are obtained, and furthermore it shares similarities with Capcom's own Mega Man series, as evidenced by its level selection mechanics and bosses, which often become much easier to defeat with certain weapons. In addition, the game features a rudimentary economy that allows Firebrand to purchase spells and potions with currency found within destructible environmental items or after defeating opponents. In a similar fashion to the Metroid series, Demon's Crest features multiple endings which unfurl differently depending upon the player's item collection percentage at the time they choose to access the game's final battle against Phalanx, which opens up fairly early on. </div>  <div> Plot : In a time long past, the world was divided into two realms, with one realm ruled by man, and the other the dominion of demons. For many years the two kingdoms were peaceful, until one fateful day six powerful crests fell from the sky into the demons' lands. The demons began to fight amongst themselves over the control of these mysterious artifacts, as it was rumored their combined magics were sufficient to make those who possessed them powerful beyond measure. Eventually, a single red demon by the name of Firebrand proved to be more cunning and vicious than his brethren, securing the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Time for himself. Not content to have only five of the six crests, however, Firebrand challenged the demon dragon Somulo for possession of the final crest, the Crest of Heaven. The ensuing battle tested both combatants to their limits, but ultimately the demon dragon succumbed, and Firebrand emerged as the undisputed master of the crests.Phalanx obtains the coveted crests.Firebrand's control over the six crests was brief, however. Taking to the skies following his battle with Somulo, Firebrand finds himself attacked unexpectedly by another of his kind, the scheming Phalanx, who took advantage of his weakened state in order to pry the crests from him. Though his exact motives are unclear, Phalanx harbors ambitions of ruling over both the human and demon realms, and he knows that the crests will give him the power to do so. Phalanx successfully wrests all six crests from his wounded opponent, though a single shard of the Crest of Fire, which splintered into five pieces during the fight, still remains in Firebrand's possession at the end of their confrontation.Defeated but still alive, Firebrand swears to take revenge against the opportunistic Phalanx and reacquire the crests. His vengeance will not be easy, though. Wary that some jealous demon would come to take the crests from him in the same manner that he took them from Firebrand, Phalanx separates the crests and spreads them arcross the demon realm, keeping only the Crest of Heaven on his person. Before he can properly challenge Phalanx for the Crest of Heaven, Firebrand must first search the land for the four hidden crests while also recovering the shattered remnants of the Crest of Fire. Time is of the essence. Phalanx intends to use the six crests to create the Crest of Infinity, which would make him unstoppable. Only the small sliver of the Crest of Fire which remains in Firebrand's possession prevents him from doing so. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The main action of Demon's Crest takes place on traditional side-scrolling levels, many of which contain archetypal stage themes (fire level, water level, ice level, etc.), in which players must travel from left to right, defeating or avoiding enemies, navigating environmental hazards like spikes and flames, and occasionally squaring off against bosses. While the game's introductory stage is predetermined, after its completion players are allowed to choose their next location by flying Firebrand there via an overworld, which essentially acts as a level selection interface. Important locations (that is, those that are tied to the player's main quest) are marked on the map in order to indicate their significance, while a number of other secondary shops and hidden locales can be access through exploration. While accessible stages can be played in any order, their difficulty, and thus their intended order of completion, is signified by a numeric indicator on the game's world map. Progress is furthermore gated by levels which will only unlock once certain conditions have been met within the currently available levels.Firebrand performs a flyby over Phalanx's Tower.The main reward of level completion comes in the form of upgrades to the player character, Firebrand. Bosses typically yield boons such as crests, new abilities, or health upgrades upon defeat, and the levels themselves often hide additional items such as talismans, which provide passive benefits, as well as urns and vellum, which can be used for potions and spellcasting respectively. Many levels include branching pathways which encourage additional playthroughs, and it is often necessary to revisit earlier levels with abilities acquired later on, as completion of certain side paths may be extremely difficult or entirely impossible without a particular item. Once a player has completed a certain amount of the game, the Tower of Phalanx is unlocked. From that point forward, the player is free to engage the game's final battle when they see fit. Players who resist the urge to challenge Phalanx immediately are rewarded with better endings and the possibility of additional post-ending content based on their completion percentage upon finishing the final battle.When not tackling the game's main stages, the player can access several non-combat areas via the overworld. These mostly consist of shops which allow players to purchase one-time use potions and spells for Firebrand with currency gathered throughout the game. Additional urns and vellum increase the maximum number of potions and spells that can be stored at one time, though ultimately gold is also required in order to purchase them. Outside of purchasing items, activities in these neutral areas is somewhat limited. A few non-player characters can be engaged with, and an additional headbutting mini-game can be played for fun and profit. It is in the player's best interest to use what currency they find, as the game's password system does not carry over money or consumable items when continuing a game. </div>  <div> Fire Crest Projectiles : Normal GargoyleBroken into five pieces at the game's outset, the Crest of Fire is tied intrinsically to Firebrand's default form, the Normal Gargoyle. The player starts with only one fragment of the crest in their possession at the game's commencement, and unlike other crests, each additional piece of the Crest of Fire must be gathered individually before the crest can be considered whole. The basic abilities of his normal form include the use of his wings to hover after jumping, utilization of his talons to indefinitely cling to non-spiked wall surfaces, and headbutting, which breaks certain background items. These traits do not change with the acquisition of additional fire shards, nor does Firebrand's appearance, but new shards grant Firebrand access to additional projectiles while in his default state, each with their own properties. Only one of the available projectile types can be in active use at any given time, and furthermore these cannot be used concurrently with other crests, though players can cycle between the different projectile types at will through the game's menu.Fire </div>  <div> Crests of Power :  The fireball is a staple of the Red Arremer clan, and the only ability which Firebrand starts the game with. It is fairly weak, and has no special properties outside of causing damage, and thus is outshined by most later projectiles. It is more than enough to handle the game's early bosses, though, and is sufficient for breaking pots when in town or when one is otherwise not in harm's way.Buster </div>  <div> Spells :  Obtained by defeating Ovununu, the Buster is a moderately damaging projectile attack which gives the appearance of being electrically charged. Outside of giving a damage boost over Fire, it is also a major exploratory tool. The Buster attack is the first weapon obtained that is capable of breaking through the stone barriers that populate many of the game's levels, barriers which can hide additional items and pathways to new areas and bosses.Tornado </div>  <div> Potions :  One of two ""specialty"" weapons in the Fire category, Tornado is a fairly underwhelming as an offensive measure due to limited range and power, though up to two projectiles can be on-screen at once, which Firebrand can use as temporary platforms. Using the Tornado's platform property successfully can be somewhat tricky, however, and once the Crest of Air is obtained, it presents a much easier way to access most areas.Claw </div>  <div> Talismans :  The second of two specialty projectiles, the Claw attack adheres to any wall spikes it comes in contact with, converting them into safe surfaces for Firebrand to cling to. More so than the Tornado, the Claw's special property has limited practical use in most areas, and also like the Tornado, it is made more or less obsolete once the the player has access to the Crest of Air and its highly mobile Aerial Gargoyle form.Demon Fire </div>  <div> Mode 7 :  The most powerful projectile in the Fire category, Demon Fire is acquired late in the game after defeating Grewon, and, once received, it essentially outclasses all other Fire Crest projectiles, save for a few specialized instances. The Demon Fire projectile takes the form of a long, blue, dragon-like gout of flame with blazing red eyes. </div> "

It is best known for its open-ended mission design and was followed by several sequels.",3030-1,1,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/desert-strike-return-to-the-gulf/3030-1/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems. </div>  <div> Story : A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the ""Madman"" himself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive. </div>  <div> Ports : Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay. </div> "

Before starting each stage, the player takes off from a zoomed-in version of the background (similar to Pilotwings) and, upon losing all their lives, spirals towards the incoming ground in the same effect. The Exploration Mode stages allows the player to drop their height, which also zooms in on the background. </div> "
The Dig,Tose,Hudson Soft,"December 1, 1993",snes,"A classic sci-fi adventure game from LucasArts and Steven Spielberg, using the SCUMM engine.",3030-2614,2614,0,1995-11-30,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-dig/3030-2614/,PEGI: 7+," <div> Overview : The Dig is a science-fiction point and click adventure game built on the SCUMM engine, as were other LucasArts adventures of the time such as The Secret of Monkey Island. The story concept was written by Steven Spielberg and was originally planned to be a movie. However, the budget required was quickly deemed too excessive, plus the CG technology of that time was not mature enough to create the asteroid Attila or the many unusual location and creatures. Ultimately, the concept was rolled over into a computer game. Around the time of release, a novelization of the game was also created, penned by veteran science fiction writer Alan Dean Foster.The game suffered a long production time. It started in 1989 and had four different project leaders, Noah Falstein, followed by Brian Moriarty, then Dave Grossman, and finally Sean Clark. The game was finally released in July, 1995, to mixed reception.The Dig went through many different incarnations. At first it was going to be set in the future, with characters crash landing on an unknown planet and having to find a way off it. The game was initially designed to be much more violent, with blood and gore in a lot of scenes. The violence was toned down because LucasArts felt it was too graphic for younger gamers. Some of this violence is kept in the novelization, most notably a detailed scene involving one of the characters' head injury.The game proudly displayed the fact that actor Robert Patrick, antagonist from Terminator 2: Judgment Day, lent his voice for commander Boston Low.The Dig was re-released via Steam on July 8th, 2009 and via Gog on March 19, 2015. </div>  <div> Story : The Dig has players following commander Boston Low through his mission to save the planet from an asteroid that would destroy Earth. But then he has to save his crew, when they are transported to a faraway planet with only their space suits and a few tools such as a shovel. Commander Low and his crew; reporter, Maggie Robbins and scientist, Dr. Ludger Brink, must explore the strange planet, dubbed ""Cocytus"", to find a way home and dig up a few discoveries along the way. </div>  <div> Score : The Dig's score was composed by Michael Land, who also composed for other LucasArts titles, such as the Monkey Island series. For The Dig's score, he gathered a lot of inspiration from Wagner, using many chords from Wagner's works. The majority of the score was played on a K2000 synthesizer, with other live instruments occasionally mixed in. A full interview with Michael Land, conducted by The Dig Museum, can be found here. </div>  <div> Secrets/Easter Eggs : Upon mousing over Boston (when not in outer space) and hitting ctrl+B, Boston will flex his muscles.After examining the communicator a few times Boston will say, ""It's a T-1000 model,"" a reference to the fact that the Boston's voice-over work was performed by Robert Patrick, who played the T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day.In the control room, if the player types ""SWAN"", they will see Boston taking a swim outside the window. This can only be done before completing the ""exploding alien turtle"" puzzle.In the tomb, on the ground on the left side of the screen, players can find a faint outline of Max the rabbit.The planet the astronauts are marooned on is nicknamed ""Cocytus"", after the circle of Hell which contained the only exit, by Ludger Brink. However, the dialogue in which he does this was removed from the final game, and it remains nameless throughout. The back of the CD case does retain the text ""Greetings from Cocytus"", though, and the novelization leaves the dialogue intact.Originally, there were meant to be four astronauts lost on Cocytus, not three. This is still reflected in the cover art for the game's soundtrack. The removed character is Toshi Olema, a Japanese businessman who funded the Atilla project on the condition that he be allowed to go into space with the crew. Olema was meant to die a gruesome death in an also-removed chamber where acid dripped from the ceiling, reflecting the more graphic nature of the game's early design. The unceasing nature of the acid flow would also mean that it would be impossible for the player to resurrect Toshi with Life Crystals, since Low would die if he attempted to get close to Olema's body. It is unknown whether Olema would have been resurrected at the end of the game when the Cocytans were freed from Spacetime Six. </div> "

It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills). </div>  <div> Story : The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs.

The game had only been announced a few months prior during Nintendo's E3 2010 media briefing. It marked the revival of the classic Donkey Kong Country platformer series developed by Rare during the mid-90s for the SNES. In February 2013, it was revealed that Monster Games would develop a port of the game, titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D for the Nintendo 3DS. </div>  <div> 3DS Version Differences : Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is set to include all the content from the Wii original along with some new extras. Among those is an ""easy mode"" that provides the player with an additional heart, a back-up DK barrel that lets them call-in Diddy Kong in case he died and mine carts can take an additional hit. There is also supposed to be not-yet disclosed ""new content."" </div>  <div> 3DS eShop Version : Size: 17,668 blocks (2 GB) </div>  <div> Development : Donkey Kong's preferred means of transportation: barrel blasting.At around April of 2008, several members of Retro Studios, the developers of the critically acclaimed Metroid Prime trilogy, left the company. At the same time, Miyamoto expressed interest in bringing back Donkey Kong in a platforming game, notably in the style of Donkey Kong Country. Michael Kelbaugh, the CEO of Retro Studios, who worked on the original Donkey Kong Country games while he was with Nintendo of America, became interested in Miyamoto's idea, and asked to be the developer behind the game.Things began to move quickly, and the idea became a reality when they began development on this game. The codename for the game during development became F8 (read as Fate) after Iwata asked them to treat the game as if they were fated to make the game. Very early on, Retro Studios decided to base the game as a successor to the SNES games, to introduce fresh and new gameplay mechanics, while still being a relative of the original games.DK and Diddy Kong traverse the landscape.The development team debated what new elements they could add to the original gameplay, or if they should introduce anything new at all. When Jungle Beat was released, the team thought long and hard about in what ways they could make Donkey Kong Country Returns stand out. Retro Studios examined how in the original games, there were two characters, but the player never had control of both of them at once - and decided to change that.They intended to have real-time co-op play (New Super Mario Bros. Wii had not been made yet), but they found it difficult to create an experience that would be equal in single player as it was in co-op, so various additions to the Donkey Kong series over the years were also incorporated into the game. Examples include Diddy Kong's rocket barrel boost, which would help a less experienced player traverse obstacles.Retro Studios played so much of the original games that they consider themselves masters at them. During development, a lot of the game levels were made like speed runs, which Mr. Tanabe had to intervene to give the game a more platformer-like feel to the pacing.An example of the advanced environmental graphics.During the game's development a lot of emphasis was placed on sound design. Retro decided to keep the sound familiar to retain the nostalgic aspect of the game, while using the graphics to convey radical new ideas and themes; to keep a proper balance of style without alienating the fanbase. Thanks to the graphical capabilities of the Wii, everything in the game, including the backgrounds, is rendered in real time compared to the completely pre-rendered graphics of the SNES games.The other big changes are the absence of the Kremlings, which played a huge role in previous Donkey Kong Country titles as the main antagonists. Neither King K. Rool nor his minions make an appearance in the game but instead, are replaced by the evil Tikis known as the Tiki Tak Tribe. </div>  <div> Story : The game's title screen.It is a peaceful day on the DK Island, that is until the volcano in the middle of DK island suddenly erupts and a huge tower know as the Tiki tower rise from the magma.That's when the players is introduced to the Tiki Tak tribe who instantly takes over DK island. 7 leaders from the Tiki Tak tribe spread around the island and hypnotize the animal life to do their dirty work (and act as basic enemies for DK and Diddy)The tribe's first action is to steal DK's golden bananas for some unknown reason, Diddy gives chase, meanwhile Donkey Kong himself is unaware of what is going on and becomes a victim for the tribe.As it turns out, DK and Diddy are immune to the tribes hypnosis magic, which gives the two monkeys a chance to make it to the top of the volcano and recover their stolen bananas.It is later revealed that DK's golden bananas have the ability to give life to new members of the Tiki tribe, as well as giving them more power. </div>  <div> Characters : Return's variation of the DK island, seen from directly aboveDonkey Kong: The king of the jungle is back. When his banana hoard of golden bananas is taken away, this huge gorilla gives chase.Diddy Kong: Donkey's pal and the second player in this game.

There is 7 leaders of them that acts as the games main bosses and a mysterious master mind who rule over them. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mine cart stages are now more hectic and chaotic.This game is a 2D platformer made in 3D, so-called 2.5D. LIke the previous Donkey Kong Country games it is all about guiding the big ape from point A to B while avoiding dangers and uncover secrets,then face the boss at the end of the world.The old games was infamous for having alot of secrets and collectables and it is no different this time, if you're going for 100% you will have to look around in each level carefully.Cannon barrels, Mine Cart and Rocket Barrels also makes a return.This game also have co-op 2 player mode New Super Mario Bros. Wii style. The second player takes the role as Diddy Kong.

It was later ported by Panic Button to the Nintendo Switch (without SnapMap functionality) on November 10, 2017.The fourth mainline title in the franchise of the same name and its second reboot, Doom harkens back to the fast-paced philosophy of early Doom and Quake installments (avoiding the slower survival-horror mechanics of Doom 3). Along with a full-fledged single-player campaign (with upgradable gear), the game features standard loadout-based multiplayer (co-developed by Certain Affinity) and a detailed level creation system (which is called ""SnapMap"" and is co-developed by Escalation).Set on a Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) research facility on a futuristic Mars overrun by the forces of Hell, the main campaign puts the player in the role of the mysterious silent protagonist known as the Doom Slayer. Awakened from a mysterious sarcophagus and armored with his high-tech Praetor Suit, the Doom Slayer must fight hordes of demons and possessed humans throughout the facility while learning of the events that's transpired (involving the harvesting of Hellish ""Argent"" energy) and preventing a larger rift between the two realms.It is the first game to run on their proprietary id Tech 6 engine and had had a long nine-year development cycle (including an original concept as a cinematic game detailing a Hell invasion of Earth). Months prior to the game's release, the multiplayer portion received both closed and open beta testing periods. Post-release, the game has received numerous updates (including new gameplay options, new game modes, and SnapMap improvements) and multiplayer content packs by Bethesda Austin (along with a season pass, with all content later made available to all in July 2017).The game later received a VR-focused spin-off (Doom VFR) on November 30, 2017 and a full-fledged sequel (Doom Eternal) on March 20, 2020. </div>  <div> Gameplay :   </div>  <div> Campaign : Rip & Tear (The UAC)Know Your Enemy (Resource Operations)Meltdown (Foundry)Beginning of the End (Argent Facility)Argent Tower (Argent Energy Tower)Into the Fire (Kadingir Sanctum)Hell on Mars (Argent Facility Destroyed)A Brighter Tomorrow (Advanced Research Complex)Lazarus (Lazarus Labs)Titan's Realm (Titan's Realm)The Crucible (Necropolis)I Am VEGA (VEGA Central Processing)The Well (Argent D'Nur) </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Pistol - Rechargable semi-automatic energy pistol that has infinite ammo and is given at the very start of the game. It is automatically modded with the Charged Energy Shot (which allows players to charge up and fire a more-powerful shot).Combat Shotgun (Shells) - Standard pump-action shotgun for close-range combat. Players can mod it with either the Charged Burst (which allows players to charge up and fire a volley of three shells in quick succession) or the Explosive Shot (which allows players to launch mortar shotshells).Plasma Rifle (Cells) - Fully automatic energy rifle that fires pulses of plasma capable of dealing minor splash damage. Players can mod it with either the Heat Blast (which allows players to release a damaging blast of excess heat, which is recharged by regular firing) or the Stun Bomb (which allows players to launch plasma orbs that detonates and stuns enemies).Heavy Assault Rifle (Bullets) - Fully automatic assault rifle for ranged combat. Players can mod it with either the Tactical Scope (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges) or the Micro Missiles (which allows players to launch small missiles).Rocket Launcher (Rockets) - Standard rocket-propelled grenade launcher that fires rockets at a straight path, dealing explosive damage over a large radius. Players can mod it with either the Remote Detonation (which allows players to detonate their rockets mid-flight) or the Lock-on Burst (which allow players to lock-in to a target and fire a volley of three rockets in a quick succession).Super Shotgun (Shells) - Old-fashioned double-barreled shotgun that deals powerful close-ranged damage (at the cost of requiring a reload after shooting). Although the weapon cannot be modded, players can still upgrade it with faster reloading, improved shot penetration, and single-shell firing.Gauss Cannon (Cells) - A large and powerful railgun that fires flechettes at a high velocity. Players can mod it with either the Precision Bolt (which allows players to zoom in at longer ranges while charging up high-damage shots) or the Siege Mode (which allows players to remain stationary to charge up a powerful beam that overpenetrates targets).Chaingun (Bullets) - Rotary machine gun with a rate-of-fire that gets faster as the gun spins up. Players can mod it with either the Gatling Rotator (which allows players to spin up the barrels without firing) or the Mobile Turret (which allows players to ""unfold"" the barrels into three smaller gatling guns that do not need to spun beforehand, reduces movement speed, and can overheat).Chainsaw (Fuel) - An old-fashioned chainsaw. Unlike the Chainsaw in previous Doom games, it does not need to be continuously ""fired"", and is instead used to trigger a special glory-kill animation (without needing to stun the enemy first). Tougher enemies require more ""Fuel"" for the animation to take effect. Enemies who die from Chainsaw Glory Kills drop massive amounts of ammunition for other weapons. Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button).BFG (Argent) - Massive energy weapon that charges for a short time before firing a large ball of energy that vaporizes everything in its short blast radius (while dealing damage to those nearby the projectile). Players can neither mod nor upgrade it, and it is not accessible through the weapon wheel (instead being toggled with a dedicated button).  </div>  <div> SnapMap : The game's central multiplayer component pits up to 12 players in team-based combat (although free-for-all modes were added post-launch). Unlike multiplayer modes in past id games, Doom's main multiplayer mode takes its cue from popular first-person shooters in the past decade and implements both weapon loadouts (where players choose their two pre-determined weapons and one piece of equipment, all of which cannot be swapped out while alive), persistent leveling (where players unlock weapons, gear, and cosmetic options for both armor and weapons), and online matchmaking (with pre-determined playlists and lobby voting).It also ties in to the in-game lore by having all players as soldiers participating in UAC's virtual reality battle simulator (announced by the VEGA artifical intelligence). Throughout the match, VEGA announces and spawns limited-use power weapons (including the Chainsaw and BFG) and power-ups (including one that transforms the player into their preferred demon type as a player-controlled ""boss character"").Players can also participate in traditional deathmatch and co-operative multiplayer using the alternate SnapMap mode. All weapons and armor cosmetics in the main multiplayer mode is also available in SnapMap. </div> "

Tournament Mode is the default single player fighting mode, in which the player can fight through every character in the game in a random order. The multiplayer mode, VS.

Dragon Quest V was the first Dragon Quest game to appear on the Super Famicom (the Super Nintendo in the United States), released on September 17, 1992.A remake developed by ArtePiazza and Matrix Software and published by Square Enix was released in 2004 on the PlayStation 2. A Nintendo DS remake was released on July 17, 2008 in Japan, and February 17, 2009 in the U.S. This was once again developed by ArtePiazza and published by Square Enix and was the first time any version of Dragon Quest V was available in the U.S. and Europe.Dragon Quest V takes place over roughly thirty years of the main character's life, from when he is born through to when he gets married and has a family. Dragon Quest V offered a new feature in the Dragon Quest series in which some monsters in random battle sequences will ask to join the player's party. This was later used in the spin-off series Dragon Quest Monsters (which is also seen as the spiritual predecessor to Pokemon). Dragon Quest V is frequently regarded as one of the best RPGs of all-time, placing 11 on Famitsu's top 100 games of all-time.The game's monster-collecting concept has since become influential, appearing in many later franchises such as Pokémon, Digimon and Dokapon. In turn, the concept of collecting everything in a game, in the form of achievements or similar rewards, has since become a common trend in video games. Dragon Quest V has also been credited as the first known video game to feature a playable pregnancy, a concept that has since appeared in later games such as Harvest Moon, The Sims 2 and Fable II. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Dragon Quest V generally offers the same gameplay expected from the Dragon Quest series. The characters level up by gaining experience points earned in battles (that take place in first person). The new feature added into this installment is the ability to tame monsters. The monster joined the player's party and leveled up in the same way that all the other characters do. However, certain monsters have a lower level cap (i.e. the Great Dragon recruit caps at level 60). The Super Famicom version has 40 different tamable monsters while both the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS version offered more.Dragon Quest V takes a change from the previous two entries in the series (III and IV) in that it only allows the player to have three players active in their party, while both III and IV allow four. The remakes once again allowed four active characters in their party. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Dragon Quest V spans 20 years (split into three generations) during which the player can marry and have children. There is no one big goal that the characters of Dragon Quest V are sent out to do. The game is more of just an adventure where the player will run into my obstacles along the way. However, about halfway through the game, the hero finds his mother kidnapped and transformed into a monster by Mildrath. For the rest of the game after that, finding the hero's mother is the main goal. One of the biggest story elements in Dragon Quest V are the time leaps the game takes. The game starts out with the player character as a child, later flashes forward to when the protagonist is a young adult where he marries, afterward, the game leaps forward to the protagonist adventuring with his children. </div>  <div> Remakes : The PlayStation 2 remake was released on March 25, 2004. The game sold 722,000 copies on the first day and sold 1.5 million in its first month of release, making it the best selling Dragon Quest remake of all-time. The remake was developed by ArtePiazza, the former art directors of Dragon Quest VII. Because of this, the game features 3D graphics very similar to Dragon Quest VII. The remake also upgraded the active players limit to four and added more tamable monsters. Another new feature is Yuuji's Specialty Museum, where the player collects various specialties from around the world and returns them to Yuuji for various rewards. </div> "

The quest is to descend through 14 levels of the eponymous Dungeon to retrieve the Fire Staff - the only weapon capable of stopping the evil Lord Chaos.Dungeon Master was originally released on the Atari ST home computer in 1987. It was later ported to various other home computers of the era, such as the Amiga, the PC, the FM Towns, the Sharp X68000 and the Apple-II. It would eventually see console ports on the Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx-CD as well. Dungeon Master was eventually followed up with a far more challenging expansion pack, Chaos Strikes Back, as well as a sequel in 1994: Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep.Dungeon Master was a trailblazing RPG in that it created the first truly real-time dungeon crawler. Previous games of the genre, such as Wizardry and Ultima, focused on long turn-based battles and thus were a little too ponderous for many. Dungeon Master's many boons to accessibility made it a huge hit. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The quest begins in the Hall of Champions. Portraits of fallen warriors line the hallways and as the player views these they are able to resurrect them to join the party. Champions must be selected carefully to complement each other as each have different skills and equipment that will be needed on the journey.The game featured a sophisticated experience system for the time in which it was made. Each character is able to progress in four classes: Fighter, Ninja, Priest and Wizard. Advancement in each is dependent on using the skills relevant to the profession. For example, a character put at the front of the party that attacks enemies with melee weapons will advance in the fighter class. Ninja classes are raised by throwing items, Priest classes are raised by creating potions through magic and Wizard classes are raised by casting offensive spells. At any point the player can simply choose to spam an activity over and over to raise their levels, as with each level raised in any class came additional health, mana and other stats. This helped mitigate the game's occasional difficulty spikes, such as the tough worm monsters on the fourth floor.As well as the experience system Dungeon Master gave each character a number of additional attributes that needed to be carefully managed throughout the quest. Characters would need food, drink and rest. Food can be occasionally found after defeating monsters, water supplies can be replenished in the occasional fountain and it is important to remember that sleeping wherever enemies were close is always a mistake.The magic system in Dungeon Master includes various recipes for spells and potions, which requires casting the correct magical runes in order. If combined correctly a spell would result. If not, nothing would occur, but the player would still lose mana from the attempt. Basic spells are provided via scrolls but many are left to the player's experimentation, with knowledge of what each individual rune symbolizes as clues. </div> "

EarthBound,"HAL Laboratory / Ape, Inc.",Nintendo,"June 5, 1995",snes,A 1994 role-playing game starring a young boy named Ness on his quest to save the world. The game and its quirky humor have garnered a dedicated cult following among RPG fans.,3030-8307,8307,0,1994-08-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/earthbound/3030-8307/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : EarthBound is a role-playing game developed by Ape and HAL Laboratory and originally published by Nintendo in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Written, directed, and produced by notable Japanese author Shigesato Itoi, EarthBound is actually the second game in Itoi's Mother franchise and is known as ""Mother 2"" in Japan. EarthBound was considered unique among its contemporaries due to its unusual setting: a quirky modern world that stood in stark contrast to the medieval fantasy and futuristic science-fiction environments common in other RPGs.In Japan,  Mother 2 was made available for Wii U Virtual Console on March 20, 2013, for thirty yen as part of a Famicom 30th Anniversary promotion. The Virtual Console version was subsequently brought to North America and Europe on July 18, 2013; this was the first re-release of the game in North America since 1995 and the first official release of the game anywhere in Europe. A digital version of the strategy guide originally packed in with the North American SNES release was made available on Nintendo's website to coincide with the Wii U re-release of EarthBound.The Mother series received a third entry in 2006, released only on the Game Boy Advance in Japan as Mother 3. EarthBound was also included in a Japanese-exclusive GBA compilation called Mother 1+2 to promote the third game's release. For many years, EarthBound was the only entry in the franchise to receive an official international release until Nintendo published an English-localized version of the first game as EarthBound Beginnings, in 2015. </div>  <div> Gameplay : EarthBound's gameplay is largely similar to earlier entries in Square Enix's popular Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy role-playing franchises. Players navigate their party from an overhead perspective through an expansive game world, conversing with NPCs, acquiring items and fighting enemies in turn-based battles. However, unlike nearly all other RPGs of its vintage, there are no random encounters; instead, combat is initiated when any member of the player's party touches an enemy in the field. Battles may also begin with a surprise attack from the enemy or a free turn for the player's party, depending on which directions the party and the enemy are facing when combat is initiated. As the party increases their levels, weaker enemies will begin to run away; encountering enemies that are significantly weaker than the party may even result in an instant victory, bypassing combat entirely.EarthBound's turn-based combatMuch like preceding Dragon Quest titles, EarthBound's combat system takes place from a first-person perspective. Both the player's party and the enemy act in turns using physical attacks, PSI abilities, and inventory items. Party stats and equipment also play a critical role during battles and heavily influence each character's viability in combat. Stats can be increased by earning experience points from defeated enemies, eventually causing characters to level-up and gain additional predetermined stat points. Ness and his friends wield a variety of relatively mundane weapons throughout the game, including baseball bats and yo-yos, and they can equip themselves with protective gear that sometimes grants additional benefits.Each character has a certain number of hit points reflecting their overall health. When a character takes damage, their hit points are gradually decremented on a rolling counter. Once a character's HP reaches zero, the character falls unconscious, preventing them from acting in battle until they are revived either by certain restorative items or by paying a doctor's fee at a Hospital. Hit points were well-established as a mechanic to reflect player health in RPGs by the time of EarthBound's release; however, the rolling HP counter used in EarthBound allows players to continue issuing commands to mortally wounded characters until their counter actually ""ticks down"" to zero. This uniquely implemented HP mechanic presents an additional layer of strategy in combat, giving players the opportunity to save their party members from KO status by either healing immediately or defeating all enemies quickly to end the battle.Inventory space in EarthBound is limited; each playable character receives fourteen inventory slots which are divided not only between consumable items, but also any equippable gear carried by the character. Certain mandatory plot-related items also occupy inventory space. These limitations are somewhat mitigated by Escargot Express, a parcel service managed through Ness' younger sister Tracy that can store several items outside of the party's inventory. </div>  <div> Story : Ness, Paula and Poo possess psychic abilities called PSI that can be used inside and outside of battle. These abilities are regulated by a character's PP, or Psychic Points. When a player's PP is drained, their PSI abilities can no longer be used. PP is restored by resting or consuming certain PP-recovering items. Characters will sometimes gain brand-new or improved PSI abilities while leveling up. Jeff does not use PSI, instead relying on his inventions for applying status effects and firing bottle rockets to deal large amounts of damage.Listed below are the available PSI abilities and their effects: </div>  <div> Cast of Characters : PSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectLifeup αNess (2), Poo (15)5Restores 75-125 HP to a single allyLifeup βNess (20), Poo (15)8Restores 225-375 HP to a single allyLifeup γNess (39), Poo (46)13Restores all HP to a single allyLifeup ΩNess (70)24Restores 300-500 HP to all alliesHealing αNess (10), Poo (15)5Heals cold, sunstroke & sleepHealing βNess (24), Poo (15)8α + poison, nausea, crying & strangeHealing γNess (53), Poo (36)20β + paralysis, diamond & death (75%)Healing ΩPoo (52)38γ + death (100% success)PSI Magnet αPaula (15), Poo (21)0Absorbs 2-8 PP from a single enemyPSI Magnet ΩPaula (21), Poo (27)0Absorbs 2-8 PP from all enemies </div>  <div> North American Retail Release : PSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectPSI Rockin' αNess (8)1040-120 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' βNess (22)1490-270 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' γNess (49)40160-480 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' ΩNess (75)98320-960 damage to all enemiesPSI Flash αNess (18)8Random crying/strange (all enemies)PSI Flash βNess (38)19α + numbness/deathPSI Flash γNess (61)24α + numbness/death (better chance)PSI Flash ΩNess (67)32α + numbness/death (best chance)PSI Fire αPaula (3)660-100 damage to one rowPSI Fire βPaula (19)12120-200 damage to one rowPSI Fire γPaula (37)20180-300 damage to one rowPSI Fire ΩPaula (64)42240-400 damage to one rowPSI Freeze αPaula (1), Poo (15)4135-255 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze βPaula (11), Poo (15)9270-450 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze γPaula (31), Poo (33)18405-675 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze ΩPaula (46)28540-900 damage to one enemyPSI Starstorm αPoo (event)24270-450 damage to all enemiesPSI Starstorm ΩPoo (event)42540-900 damage to all enemiesPSI Thunder αPaula (8), Poo (15)360-180 damage to one enemyPSI Thunder βPaula (25), Poo (15)760-180 damage to one enemy (x2)PSI Thunder γPaula (57), Poo (41)16100-300 damage to one enemy (x3)PSI Thunder ΩPoo (55)20100-300 damage to one enemy (x4) </div>  <div> Soundtrack : PSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectHypnosis αNess (4)6Puts one enemy to sleepHypnosis ΩNess (27)18Puts all enemies to sleepShield αNess (12), Poo (15)6Shields one allyShield ΣPoo (15)18Shields all alliesShield βNess (34), Poo (16)10Power shields one allyShield ΩPoo (51)30Power shields all alliesPSI Shield αPaula (6)8Psychic shields one allyPSI Shield ΣPaula (26)24Psychic shields all alliesPSI Shield βPaula (51)14Psychic power shields one allyPSI Shield ΩPaula (60)42Psychic power shields all alliesBrainshock αPoo (24)10Makes one enemy feel strangeBrainshock ΩPoo (44)30Makes all enemies feel strangeParalysis αNess (14)8Paralyzes one enemyParalysis ΩNess (29)24Paralyzes all enemiesOffense Up αPaula (21)10Raises one ally's offenseOffense Up ΩPaula (40)30Raises all allies' offenseDefense Down αPaula (29)6Decreases one enemy's defenseDefense Down ΩPaula (54)18Decreases all enemies' defenseThe game's various ""Shield"" abilities apply different effects when used.

Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens).

This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blasterJim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping. </div>  <div> Planets : Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck. </div>  <div> Avatar Awards : Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue. </div> "

But in order to use Snot, the player must find green spots on top of certain areas in the level that he can attach to. Replacing Jim's copter from the last game, Jim can use Snot to float down to other areas in order to catch himself.There is also some added items for Jim to collect and other weapons in this game. Jim can now collect Can O' Worms this time around by going into hidden areas in the level as well as collect health that goes up to 200%. Also as an added bonus, Jim can now collect all three flags in a given level to unlock a password that allows the player to enter the level again. </div>  <div> Levels : Jim must travel to new, strange and oftentimes creepy levels in order to get to Psycrow and save his love.

These races, named ""F-Zero"", uses futuristic technology that allows machines to hover above large floating tracks and propel at incredible speeds. Players pick one of four machines (Blue Falcon, Golden Fox, Wild Goose, and Fire Stingray) and attempt to qualify in each of the fifteen circuits (split into three leagues: Knight, Queen, and King).F-Zero received a multitude of sequels for subsequent Nintendo platforms (including F-Zero X for the Nintendo 64, F-Zero: Maximum Velocity for the Game Boy Advance, and F-Zero GX for the GameCube) and obscure console expansions (including the BS F-Zero Grand Prix series for the Satellaview and F-Zero X Expansion Kit for the Nintendo 64DD). Each game in the series further expands the game's lore and roster while adding a variety of crazy tracks (including those in full 3D). </div>  <div> Gameplay : In F-Zero, players must maneuver their incredibly-fast F-Zero machine around five laps of each circuit, avoiding various hazards (such as rough roads, slip zones, land mines, magnets, and the track's barriers) and other F-Zero machines (including critically damaged racers, which explode upon impact) while attempting to overtake and maintain a winning ranking among their computer-controlled rivals. </div>  <div> Playable Machines : Players use the B button to accelerate, the X or Y buttons to brake, the left and right parts of the D-Pad to steer left and right, and the L and R buttons to shift the machine's weight to the left or right (letting players slide around tight corners with ease).One of the game's riskier shortcuts, a giant bounce pad shaped like an arrow. When the machine is in the air (due to hitting a jump plate), players can use the left and right parts of the D-Pad to steer the machine and the top and bottom parts of the D-Pad to adjust the machine's tilt, shortening or lengthening the jumping distance. Holding down on the D-Pad while landing a jump (in which the machine's rear is below its front) prevents an ""impact shock"" of landing incorrectly (which would cause the machine to decelerate).After each lap is completed, the player is awarded with a manual four-second turbo boost (called the ""Super Jet"", shown as the S symbol in the bottom-right of the screen), which can be triggered by pressing the A button. Players can only stock three Super Jets at one time.Several tracks also include helpful characteristics such as Ramps, Shortcuts and Speed Boost Arrows to help the drivers improve their time. </div>  <div> Circuits : Each F-Zero machine has a vitality gauge, called ""Power"", which is drained each time the player's machine hits various obstacles, such as the track's barrier and opponent machines. As the gauge depletes, the machine begins to visually malfunction, both the machine and the gauge flashing and twitching. If the gauge is fully depleted or the player falls off the track, the machine crashes in a loud, fiery explosion and the player is immediately disqualified from the race.Scattered throughout each circuit is a special ""pit stop"" strip. Players who drive over it slowly replenish the machine's vitality (due to a large floating machine that ""heals"" it). </div> "

Fighter's History,Data East,Data East,"August 1, 1994",snes,"Data East's first post-SF2 fighting game, infamous for being so similar to Street Fighter II that it triggered a lawsuit from Capcom USA.",3030-10486,10486,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/fighters-history/3030-10486/,," <div> Overview : Fighter's History is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Data East for arcades in 1993.The game featured basic, smooth gameplay mechanics and the standard six-button control scheme made famous by  Street Fighter II. (Things that other fighting games at the time did not implement well.) The game topped the Japanese arcade charts at the time, causing  Capcom to take notice and bring Data East to court in the United States.One of the main features of this game is that in order to dizzy an opponent, the player must attack the opponent's weak position (which differs per character and can be head, chest, or legs). Clothing representing the weak position glow as it's attacked until it breaks, dizzying the opponent. It's also known for including one of Data East's earlier characters, the Russian strongman Karnov, as the game's final boss.The game was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System worldwide a year later, adding features such as a Turbo speed setting and the ability to play as the two boss characters. The game also spawned two sequels: Fighter's History Dynamite for the  Neo Geo in 1994 and the Japanese-exclusive Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! for the SNES in 1995.The game later received a digitally re-release by Flying Tiger Entertainment for the Nintendo Switch on January 3, 2019, as part of the Johnny Turbo's Arcade series. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes nine playable characters and two unplayable bosses (who were later made playable in the SNES version).Ray McDougal (USA) Makoto Mizoguchi (Japan)Liu Feilin (China)Ryoko Kano (Japan)Matlok Jade (UK)Samchay Tomyamgun (Thailand)Lee Diendou (China)Jean Pierre (France)Marstorius (Italy)Clown (France, boss) Karnov (Russia, final boss) </div>  <div> Lawsuit : Coincidentally, Data East USA has been in court involving a fighting game in the 1980s, claiming that  Epyx licensed and distributed  World Karate Championship (better known as International Karate), which they believe infringed on their fighting game (Karate Champ). The game names were similar, combatants wore white and red outfits, referees looked the same in-game, the moves were similar, and the scoring mechanisms were the same. However, the court judged that these similarities encompassed ""the idea of karate"" (they were the elements of a karate video game) and was not protected by copyright. Due to this, Data East lost the case.Capcom USA attempted to sue Data East USA in 1994 with similar claims, claiming that Fighter's History infringed on  Street Fighter II. Capcom identified the similarities into four categories: representation of the playable characters, representation of the special moves, control sequences for the special moves, and miscellaneous (such as ""V.S."" screens, attract mode, and tracking a player's vitality). The court ruled that the miscellaneous similarities were commonplace and not protected by copyright (in a similar vein to the previous Data East lawsuit). The court also ruled that while the control sequences for the special moves were similar, they were not a form of expression protected by copyright. As for the representation of the playable characters and special moves, the court found three characters (Matlok, Feilin, and Ray) and five special moves in Fighter's History were similar but not virtually identical to characters and moves found in Street Fighter II. Because of this analysis, Capcom lost the case.This case marks a decline of Capcom's close grip of the fighting game genre, as it provoked other fighting games to be less restrictive in terms of emulating the mechanics of what is known as the ""traditional fighting game"". </div> "

Many elements of the series are simplified, including the overworld (which cannot be free-roamed), random enemy encounters (which are removed), and the inventory system (with upgradeable weapons and armor).Players control young adventurer Benjamin (known as Zash in the Japanese version) as he sets out to reclaim the four Focus Tower crystals (Earth, Ice, Fire, and Wind) from a group of powerful monsters (the Vile Evils). While journeying through the game's four regions (Foresta, Aquaria, Fireburg, and Windia), Benjamin encounters numerous allies that join him as temporary partners (using a simplified two-person Party system where players can opt to let the partner act autonomously).The game was later digitally re-released by Nintendo for the Wii (via Virtual Console) in late 2010 (September 24 in Europe, October 18 in North America, and December 21 in Japan). It was also digitally re-released for the Wii U in Japan on April 16, 2014. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Unlike most of the Squaresoft RPGs of the time, there are no save points; players are allowed to save at any time. Party size is limited to two with Benjamin and a secondary character slot that rotates as the story progresses. In place of random battles, the player is able to see enemies on the field without the need of an item until a specific point in the game, but all enemies are stationary and incapable of roaming. Also unlike most RPGs, players are not allowed to free roam the world map, making the gameplay mostly linear. The player is required to follow guided paths, some of which could be blocked off until tasks are completed. Characters can jump, and use weapons outside of battle lending it an action-adventure type of gameplay also not found in other Final Fantasies. Mystic Quest includes many puzzles during the gameplay. Mystic Quest does not have the tradition of random enemies like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise, instead the player battles stationary enemies within dungeons. The player has the choice whether to attack the enemy or not, and can prepare beforehand with restorative items. The battle screen appears after approaching an enemy, turns are awarded back and forth with the fastest character getting the most turns. Players can battle, run, or ""control"" during the battle menu. Control can allow the player to manually control their allies or have the CPU control them. Battle is influenced by statistics like speed, accuracy, or attacking power. Characters gain experience points and gold pieces from winning battles. The game also includes battlefields that the player can enter and attempt to clear out ten battles against pre-set enemy encounters which rewards the player with a large cash prize or even a unique item. </div>  <div> Soundtrack :  Soundtrack cover The Soundtrack for Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was composed by Yasuhiro Kawakami and Ryuji Sasai.01 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST I02 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST II03 - Mystic Quest04 - Hill of Fate05 - World06 - Beautiful Forest07 - Battle 108 - Victory Fanfare09 - City of Forest10 - Fossil Labyrinth11 - Battle 212 - Middle Tower13 - Shrine of Light14 - Rock Theme15 - Fanfare of Friendship16 - Dungeon of Ice17 - Dungeon of Waterfall18 - City of Fire - Faeria19 - Rock 'n' Roll20 - Lava Dome21 - City of Wind - Windaria22 - Mountain Range of Whirlwinds23 - The Crystal24 - Last Castle25 - Battle 326 - Mystic Ballad27 - Ending28 - RE-MIXTIC QUEST </div> "

It is a side-scrolling ""beat 'em up"" (or brawler) with attacks consisting mainly of simple punching and kicking, as well as grabs, throws, aerial attacks and special moves which clear the area around the player while draining a small amount of health. Knives, swords and pipes can also be used.

This version was available as a rental-only game from Blockbuster video stores.The SNES version of Final Fight was also limited to three on-screen enemies simultaneously, whereas it was a common occurrence in the arcade version to fight far more than this amount, easily double or triple. One silver lining to the SNES port is the arrangement of the music; Capcom tailored the soundtrack to fit the sample-based capabilities of the SNES sound chip.

There is a lot of confusion as to where the black box version came from, and very few have ever been found. Theories express that it could have been the original color of the box until an exclusive deal was later made with Blockbuster or that it was a Canadian variant, despite it being marked as available in the US. This small variation can make these versions of the game very valuable from a collector's standpoint.Two sequels, Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3, were released on the SNES in 1993 and 1995, respectively. It is likely due to more experience working with the SNES hardware that Capcom was able to offer a fuller experience with each of these sequels, including co-op play as well as more enemies on-screen at once.Much later, the game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as Final Fight One. Final Fight: One featured small dialog exchanges before boss fights, unlockable features, and the Street Fighter: Alpha versions of Cody and Guy.

The King of Ishmeria turned the seven gems into a crown and used its power to bring peace to the island. When he died, his son Eselred took power.Eselred used the crown to exact a tyrannical rule. His daughter, Princess Robyn -- encouraged by the whispers of Pastha the water dragon (who once fought alongside the trapped wizards) -- destroyed the Gemfire to thwart her father's oppression.Breaking the crown scattered the gems to the far corners of Ishmeria where the island's rebellious families found and used the wizards inside to aid their quest to overthrow Eselred and unite the country in peace. </div>  <div> Gameplay : When the game starts, players have their choice of four scenarios: Erin & Ander, Flax's Shame,Terian's War, and Gemfire.

It introduces the ""Edit Mode"" system, allowing players to fully-customize their weapon loadout.",3030-7617,7617,0,1989-12-11,https://www.giantbomb.com/gradius-iii/3030-7617/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Gradius III (known in Japan as Gradius III: Densetsu kara Shinwa e, the sub-title loosely translated to ""From Legend to Myth"") is a sci-fi side-scrolling shoot-'em-up developed and released by Konami for arcades exclusively in Japan on December 1989.The third entry in the Gradius series (and the sequel to Gradius II: GOFER no Yazou), Gradius III puts players back in control of the starfighter Vic Viper as a new Bacterian force is making their way to the planet Gradius.The game retains most of the gameplay from the first two games, with some new additions and changes. Along with a variety of new power-ups, the most notable addition to the game is the ability to freely-customize the Power Meter. In addition, some versions of the game also include an alternate mode for beginners (reducing the game to three levels while making the game easier). The game also includes a behind-the-back scalar-3D segment used for one level.The game received only one port in that era (for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System), released in both Japan (on December 21, 1990) and North America (on August 13, 1991). It features numerous changes in stage layouts, optional difficulty selections, new power-up choices, and the option to continue. This version was later digitally re-released for the Wii (as a Virtual Console title) in 2007 (April in North America, September in both Japan and Europe).The game was also bundled with Gradius IV: Fukkatsu as part of the Gradius III and IV compilation for the PlayStation 2 in 2000 (April in Japan, November in both North America and Europe). This version of the game includes some adjustments, as well as some new features (including the Japanese-exclusive online leaderboards and an unlockable ""Extra Edit Mode"" with additional power-ups to choose from). It was also included in the 2006 PlayStation Portable compilation Gradius Collection. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is infamous as being one of the hardest of the series, as the original arcade version had no way to continue the game upon losing all lives, and a continue system wasn't even in place to be used at the discretion of the owner and operator. The biggest addition is the ability for the player to edit their weapon load-out, that will come with power ups collected through the game. Players can choose predetermined setups or opt to customize their own, though certain variations of weapons are not available between modes. </div>  <div> Power Meter : The Power Meter system from the previous games returns, in which players start each life with minimal speed and a basic cannon shot, and can upgrade their ship by collecting Power Capsules to progress through their seven-part Power Meter (and then using the Power-Up button to collect the meter's highlighted power-up). One new power-up is added to the series, called the Extra (marked with the ""!"" symbol). </div>  <div> Stages : It also includes the Power Meter Select system from Gradius II (as Weapon Type Select), in which players can choose from four different weapon configurations (changing the Missile, Double, and Laser power-ups). Instead of the classic Type-A configuration, players can optionally choose:Type-B: Spread Bomb, Tailgun, Ripple LaserType-C: 2-Way Missile, Vertical, Cyclone LaserType-D: Photon Torpedo, Free-Way, Twin LaserIn the SNES version, both Spread Bomb and 2-Way Missile are reversed, and Free-Way is replaced by the new Back Double.After choosing from the four Weapon Types players can choose from three different barrier types (Force Field, Shield, and Free Shield). Free Shield is not selectable in the SNES version. The Speed-Up, Option and Extra power-ups are the same for all four Types. </div>  <div> Bosses (SNES) : New to the series is the optional Edit Mode, which allows players to customize their own Weapon Type by choosing a variety of options for each Power-Up:Missile - Normal, Control, Upper Missile, S. SpreadDouble - Vertical, Spread Gun, Tailgun, Free-WayLaser - Twin Laser, Ripple, E. Laser, C. LaserOption - Option, S. Option? - Force Field, Shield, Free Shield, Reduce! - Normal, Speed Down, Extra Life OptionIn the SNES version, this is changed to:Missile - Missile, Hawk Wind, 2-Way Back, S.

Shield, Reduce! - Speed Down, Remain Option, Full Barrier, Mega CrushThe Speed-Up power-up is the same, no matter the configuration. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper. This can be activated up to five times to further increase the speed, although higher levels can be very unwieldy.This is the only power-up that is standard in all configurations. </div> "

After fighting through the midway, and finding Donald, he grants the mice the cleaner outfit to do battle with the many enemies. The level then goes to the big top, and then to the backstage area.Stage 2 - The Jungle: After escaping the circus, Mickey and Minnie meet with the Lonesome Ghosts, who inform them that Pluto has run to their house at the other end of the jungle. Eager to collect Pluto, the ghosts offer Mickey and Minnie safari outfits to help them get through the jungle more easily.Stage 3 - The Haunted House: Upon arriving at the Lonesome Ghosts' house, Pluto greets Mickey and Minnie at the door. They are then informed that Pete's henchmen have moved in and are destroying their home. Unable to wear the cowboy costumes themselves, the ghosts offer them to the mice, who fight their way through the mansions halls, stairways, library and finally to the top of the tower.Stage 4 -  The Caves: Deep underground, a new battle awaits Mickey and Minnie as they fight their way out of the caverns. Racing against rising water levels and falling crystals, the caves prove to be a treacherous obstacle in the quest to reach Pete's castle.Stage 5 - The Frozen Plains: This icy area boasts many hazards, including a fluctuating water level, spike traps and bottomless pits. They must reach the frozen temple at the end to reach the next step to get to Pete's castle.Stage 6 - The Baron's Castle: The final level. Here, almost every one of Pete's minions lies in wait. The way through the castle is made even more tricky by the presence of innumerable traps, which have been laid for the intruding mice. Will Mickey and Minnie be able to reach Baron Pete, defeat him and end their magical quest? </div>  <div> Bosses : Juggler Weasel: The first boss who is fought. He is a weasel dressed as a clown who fights by throwing lit torches at Mickey and Minnie, then charges forth. He is only vulnerable to attack when he throws his torches.Ringmaster Lion: The ringmaster of the circus level. he attacks by jumping high and crashing down, as well as throwing his mane at Mickey and Minnie. When he is standing still, Mickey and Minnie can use the cleaner costume to vacuum off his mane and prevent him from attacking that way. Occasionally, he will sneeze and blow his mane in all directions.The Turtle: A hunchbacked, blue-shelled turtle who fights Mickey and Minnie in the jungle. His main method of attack is to splash the mice with water, and jump at them. He is only vulnerable when he leaves his shell.The Gorilla: King of the apes, who attacks mainly from the treetops. Drops down to crush the mice, rolls at high speeds across the screens and shakes the trees to drop coconuts. His attacks are easiest to dodge when the safari costume is worn.Pete's Portrait: As mean as the real thing. This haunted painting attacks by bringing books to life and leaning out of his own frame to blow fire at Mickey and Minnie. He is only vulnerable when he is out of his frame.The Boss Ghost: Boss of the other ghosts in the haunted house. Attacks by teleporting around the room and hurling smaller ghosts at Mickey and Minnie. There are no other items that can be used to attack it, so it can be easily defeated with a few shots of the cowboy costume's popgun.Jackhammer Weasel: A weasel with a jackhammer and a hardhat, who is fought in the caves. He jumps rapidly across the screen, destroying the ground that he and the mice fight on. Occasionally, he will hammer the wall and drop rocks from the ceiling, which will restore the broken ground. His hardhat prevents him from being jumped on, so he must be shot with the cowboy costume's popgun.The Dinosaur: If extinction couldn't beat this thing, surely two little mice can't. The dinosaur is awoken by Mickey and Minnie walking across its back, and it is not happy. It attacks by swinging its spiked tail, snorting its noxious breath and bringing its own spines to life. It is vulnerable to any attack, but only when it cranes its head into view.Arctic Weasel: This weasel takes cover in a mobile ice floe, which is outfitted with spikes on the exterior. On occasion, the water level in his arena will rise and fall, making him more difficult to hit. He is only vulnerable when he climbs out of the top of his floe and throws two icicles at Mickey and Minnie.Snowstorm: A living storm cloud that shoots out bouncing bolts of lightning and snowflakes that will freeze the mice. It is completely intangible and invulnerable to almost any attack. The only way that Mickey and Minnie are able to defeat it is by using their cleaner costumes to suck up the cloud. The more it is hit the smaller it becomes. However, if left alone long enough it will start to regrow.Baron Pete: The final boss. Fought in his lab, Pete attacks with evil magic spells that can shoot fire, electricity and summon minions. At first, he is invulnerable, until his helmet is broken by several shots from the cowboy costume's popgun. After taking enough damage, it seems that he has been defeated. Until it is revealed that he was simply casting another spell to begin the second phase of the fight. Can he be defeated in his monstrous form? </div> "

Developed and published by Irem, GunForce was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sans subtitle. This version was released in November of 1992. GunForce is very similar to the Contra series, and essentially follows the same formula as other side scrolling action platformers of the time. The Arcade original is featured in Irem Arcade Hits for Mac and PC.The player takes control of an unnamed super soldier, protecting Earth from an undetermined menace. This soldier provides ample commentary in between stages, stating exactly what he is doing and why (e.g. ""I am going into this base to destroy the enemies!""). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Some bosses appear to be directly out of Contra...GunForce's gameplay is very much akin to Contra III: The Alien Wars, another action game released around the same time. The player takes control of a super soldier, shooting away enemies in each of GunForce's five stages, while simultaneously dodging enemy fire. However, GunForce is substantially easier than Contra III, due to continues which place the player directly back into the action and scant enemy fire.As well as merely shooting away enemies, players can pick up power-ups either dropped by enemies or found in destroyed crates. There are a few different types of gun, each of which replaces the previously held gun. The laser fires through enemies, and is one of the more powerful weapons. The flamethrower is short range, with a high ammunition count, and the bazooka is powerful, long range, but has low ammunition.The game gives the player five lives. After these lives are lost, the player is prompted to continue. Continuing merely respawns the player in exactly the spot that their death occurred in, rendering the game significantly easier than other similar side scrolling action games of the time. </div> "

The gameplay systems involved allow players to pass the puck to other members on their team and for the opposing team to intercept the puck by skating and breaking the straight line of passage between both of the passing team players.The game gets more arcade like with the super shots. A player if left alone and unobstructed for long enough can charge up the shot causing their player to backflip and shoot the puck past the goalie or into the goalie knocking them into the net for the goal. The next super shot is is a windmill which which is performed when one player is skating behind the net and hitting the pass button when the player in front of the net's stick begins to glow. If done correctly the puck will be flipped over the net and the player in front will spin and bat the puck into the net.Since the game is basically a hockey version of  Arch Rivals there are no rules. Players have special moves including: elbows, headbutts, slashing, and a swift kick to the groin, all of which are illegal in the sport of hockey. Along with with no penalties comes fighting and lots of it; though it occurs at random the players will fight, and when in a fight the player can dodge by holding away from the opposing player, punch and also uppercut, the loser of the brawl falling to the ice with birds flying over their head. Winning a fight comes with a few advantages, the player involved in the scuff will receive and speed boost and the chance to grab some tainted although very powerful water from the bench resulting in a zero time charge for a Super Shot, while the loser will stay sluggish in control for sometime after the fight, and if a player loses too many fights in one period they are removed with an injury. </div>  <div> The Roster : Hit the Ice is in no way connected the the NHL so therefore does not contain any NHL players.""Dicky"" Fontaine""Gunner"" Hall (spoof of Glen Hall)Pierre BourdoirPhil Bonker (spoof of Phil Esposito)""Battleship"" BoydDavid VolekIven Yakashev spoof of a Soviet player from 1972Willy Lindberg Tom Horyna (spoof of Tim Horton)Al GiglianoHappy Goleck (""happy-go-lucky"")Wayne Greatman (spoof of Wayne Gretzky)Reggy MarshJonny NovakPetter Kidd, *""Bo"" ClevelandBob DoverMike Barr </div> "

The Ignition Factor was rereleased on Nintendo's Virtual Console on August 25, 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Ignition Factor is broken up into different levels, reflecting a variety of settings and scenarios. The player is briefed prior to starting a mission, at which point they are able to review maps of the building, select the placement of their firetruck, and equip relevant equipment. One must account for encumbrance when selecting equipment, as bringing too many items will hinder players, limiting one's ability to both kick and sprint. Players automatically begin each level with a standard fire extinguisher and are allowed to pick from a variety of additional items including:Chemical Fire Extinguisher - This extinguisher will put out chemical fires.Electrical Fire Extinguisher - This extinguisher will put out electrical fires.Oxygen Tank and Mask - This item will allow breathing in toxic conditions.Rope - Areas can be crossed using the rope.Axe - Can be used to open doors.Protecting fossils from the encroaching flames.All three extinguishers start with an ammo count of 99 which is depleted through their use.

Players have three changes to complete any given mission, and must remain mindful of both their health and the time limit which varies between stages. Levels become increasingly dangerous over time, encouraging players to complete their objectives as quickly as possible. Players are awarded a score at the end of each stage based on several criteria, including: remaining time, civilians rescued, and items retrieved. Different scenarios will present different challenges and objectives, some of which are optional. For example, one optional objective has players protecting fossils from oncoming fire as workers remove them from a museum. </div> "

Incorporating action and RPG elements, the game tracks the adventures of a young boy named Will, who has been tasked with a mysterious quest by his missing father. He and his friends are swept across the world by his unfolding destiny.It is the second part of the Soul Blazer franchise, which includes Soul Blazer, Terranigma (both also for SNES) and The Granstream Saga. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The sprite-based game features an angled top-down view of the action, with the player controlling Will (in one guise or another) through the entire game. Will can attack enemies with his flute in the game's real-time combat. As the game progresses, Will gains access to ""Dark Space,"" an extradimensional area accessible by stationary portals where he can save his game and transform himself into Freedan (and later, Shadow), a character more suited for combat. All three characters learn techniques that make them either required or preferred to advance through parts of the game.Statistical character development is limited to jewels that increase either Attack, Defense, or Health. These jewels can be found by killing all the enemies in an area, which is also occasionally necessary to release a Force that removes an obstacle to advancement. These enemies are indicated on Will's map and do not respawn once killed unless Will runs out of lives or returns to an area he has since left. Lives can be gained by collecting 100 jewels dropped by most defeated enemies. Health can be restored through the use of herbs, of which there are a finite number hidden in the game. There is no currency or merchants in the sense of traditional RPGs; however there is a Jeweler who rewards Will with items for ""sending"" him gems he finds (a use-action that can be activated from the gem). There are 50 such gems hidden throughout the game, and collecting them all reveals a secret level and the story behind the Jeweler.As Will's adventure leads him forward, areas and towns are left behind, oftentimes permanently. The first half (roughly) of the game world will become inaccessible by the second half. Therefore, it is important for the player to collect as many herbs, gems, and statistical jewels as possible before moving on, as failing to accomplish enough can leave Will lacking later on and make the game more difficult. Much of the game takes place in conversation, both in towns and many other, less traditional places for conversation. In some places the player must simply read the story, in others the player must spur the game forward, either by talking, waiting, watching, or fetching an apple from the marketplace.An odd note is that an entire walkthrough for the game (including the locations of the hidden jewels) is included in the game manual. </div>  <div> Characters : Will </div> "

Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike, and Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, who threaten the United States with nuclear weapons. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays from an isometric perspective and is broken down into specific missions that need to be accomplished on each level. These range from attacking certain locations to recovering items and personnel to defending allied units and buildings. Should any of the objectives result in a failure, the player must restart the level from the beginning. Before each level, players choose a co-pilot to help them, which gives the players semi-automatic to automatic fire on the machine guns. During the missions, fuel, ammunition, and armor all factor into the gameplay and can be recovered by finding related objects in the level. </div>  <div> Story : Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike, plots his revenge against the United States by allying himself with Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, and announces his dominance by dropping a nuke on an island somewhere in the Pacific. STRIKE quickly send their top agent to secure the President and the surrounding D.C. area against terrorist attack. After securing the President, STRIKE moves to nullify Kilbaba's nuclear capability and control of specific regions. Being pushed back to the mountains, Kilbaba and the Drug Lord put up a strong resistance in their fortress, but are captured and taken back to the United States. However, both are able to escape following an attack on the Capitol. In the end, Kilbaba's escape in a gasoline truck is cut short and the Drug Lord is presumed dead after attempting to flee in a bus.

Jurassic Park,Ocean Software,Ocean Software,"November 30, 1993",snes,Telltale Games continue on from the events of the first Jurassic Park film with this cinematic adventure game.,3030-33851,33851,0,2011-11-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/jurassic-park/3030-33851/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Telltale's Jurassic Park: The Game tells a story that opens directly parallel with the story of the first motion picture and deals with the plot points that were abandoned after the 1993 blockbuster film ended. Mainly, Dennis Nedry's Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos, which serves as the opening plot point for the main characters to meet. The timeline of the game occurs both within the film and in the aftermath of the incident, and the player experiences these moments in part from the viewpoint of Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian, Gerry Harding. Other characters include Harding's daughter Jess and other inhabitants of Isla Nublar not seen in the movie, such as scientists, smugglers, or mercenaries. Like recent releases from Telltale Games, Jurassic Park: The Game is broken up into a series of four episodes. However, all four episodes ship with the game, with one easily transitioning to the next without having to purchase the next episode piecemeal. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Telltale Games has said to have been heavily influenced by Heavy Rain's mechanics. The game includes slow-paced investigation sequences where the player pans the camera and initiates sequences where the main character takes closer looks at key places. This is often accompanied with dialogue choices, moving between key locations within the puzzle area, and minor button-mashing sequences. It will also shift to immediate response Quick Time Events when a life or death situation presents itself, such as directional input either solo or in sequences, and also faster button-mashing sequences. If the player is not quick enough to complete the button prompts on the screen, they will either be rewarded with another chance to get the sequence right or with a delightful character death sequence, such as being crushed between the horns of a Triceratops or the jaws of a Tyrannosaurus. Not even young Jess is spared from meeting a demise.There are many cases where a failed Quick Time Event won't immediately render a death screen though. Some will only drain the end Award level for each survival sequence.Gold - Complete all QTEs in the sequence.Silver - Miss one QTE in the sequence.Bronze - Missed three QTEs in the sequence.No Award - Missed five QTEs prompts in the sequence.If the player fails a QTE that results in death, the game will reload to a designated checkpoint where the sequence started, this will cause players to lose one award point. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Jurassic Park: The Game is comprised of four episodes, each being 11 to 12 scenarios long. Each scenario takes place in a different location of the park. Some locations will be familiar to fans of the first Jurassic Park film, such as the Dennis Nedry car scene or the Park's Visitor Center, while other locations will be brand new to both new players and old fans. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The episode opens with Nima Cruz stumbling through the jungle, injured, clutching the Barbasol can and growing more and more delirious. Hired by BioSyn, she's been searching for Dennis Nedry and the can, unaware of the content or even about the kind of animals roaming the park. After surviving an onslaught of Dilophosauruses, she's then been attacked by a different kind of poisonous dinosaur called Troodon and there's a pack of them stalking her as she grows weaker with every step. This is where she's almost run over by a jeep driven by Gerry Harding, on his way back to the visitor's center with his teenage daughter Jess. Unaware of her reasons to be on the island, Gerry lifts her into the car and tries to stabilize her so she can receive treatment. When they make it back to the visitor's center, they enter it just in time to miss the sight of the helicopter carrying off the survivors from the motion picture.With the T-rex still being around, they fight their way to save Nima and survive themselves. Though the situation naturally only gets worse as Nima's desperation to get the can to the North Harbor becomes more apparent. Only minutes after regaining consciousness, she draws a gun on the father and daughter. </div> "
Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues,Ocean Software,Ocean Software,January 1995,snes,The Chaos Continues is the SNES and Game Boy sequel to the original Jurassic Park.,3030-16458,16458,0,1994-11-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/jurassic-park-part-2-the-chaos-continues/3030-16458/,," <div> Overview : One mission involved fighting a T-rex.Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is a non-canonical sequel to the original Jurassic Park game, and by extension the Jurassic Park book and film.The original Jurassic Park games on Nintendo's platforms were a huge success. In response Ocean, the development house responsible for the original titles, began work on a sequel.In 1994 The Chaos Continues was released for the Game Boy and Super Nintendo. For the new game, Ocean took a new design. Unlike the original games, which were all mainly top-down perspective games, The Chaos Continues was a side-scrolling shooter. It also had an animated opening cutscene for the SNES version. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The version for the Super Nintendo is a standard sidescroller. Upon starting a new game the player is confronted with a menu screen that gives them several missions to choose from. Completing one mission brings them back to select another. Finishing missions progresses the player through the game. The main plot is that the bio-engineering company Biosyn, rival to John Hammond's InGen, dispatched troops to Isla Nublar to take control of the facilities and the dinosaurs. Hammond asks Dr. Alan Grant and soldier Michael Wolfskin to head to the island and stop Biosyn.The game's arsenal consists of a charging stun gun, machine guns, and shotguns. Utilizing the stun gun is an important factor in the game, because killing too many non-velociraptor enemies results in the island's ecosystem being destroyed, leading to the game over screen. </div>  <div> Game Boy Version : The GB version has a much different look than the SNES version.The Game Boy version is also a side-scrolling shooter, but it unfolds slightly differently. Abandoning the mission structure of the SNES version, the Game Boy version progresses strictly linearly. The game is divided into a series of similarly themed levels called zones. Most zones have two levels which requires the player to gather a set number of key cards in order to open a gate at the end of the level, with the third level being a boss battle.Interspersed between these normal zones is the occasional T-rex zone, which requires navigating a maze-like level while a Tyrannosaurus chased the player character. Collecting all the keycards in these levels resulted in an extra continue. </div> "

Bombuzal,Kemco,Kemco,"August 31, 1992",snes,An explosives-based isometric puzzle game in which players must detonate a series of bombs to clear each stage.,3030-2163,2163,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/bombuzal/3030-2163/,," <div> Overview : Bombuzal is a puzzle game originally developed by Image Works for several North American and European home computers such as the Amiga, the Atari ST and the Commodore 64. The goal is to clear each stage of all its bombs by detonating them while also keeping clear of the deadly blasts. The game's original title is a play on the word ""bamboozle"", meaning to trick, mystify or confound someone.Mirrorsoft's port developed for SNES was released in 1990 under its original title in Japan, but the game was renamed ""Ka-blooey"" for a 1992 US release. Bombuzal holds the distinction of being the third game to be released on Super Famicom, as well as being the console's first port of a preexisting title. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Bombuzal must detonate all the bombs in a single level without dying in order to advance to the next level. The bombs vary in size; however, usually only the smallest variety can be manually detonated by players if they wish to survive the blast. Instead, medium- and large-size bombs must be detonated from a distance via chain reaction. The player can switch between two viewing modes: an isometric view of the field for gameplay, as well as a top-down overview of the entire stage.As stages progress, puzzle solutions become increasingly difficult and often hinge on a single correct course of action, similar to other computer puzzle games like Sokoban or Puzznic. Failure to execute the proper sequence of movements and detonations usually requires restarting a stage, as the player will often end up trapped on tiles with bombs remaining and no escape route. In later levels, hazards such as fragile floors, slippery ice tiles and roving enemies are gradually added. </div> "

It saw a Super Famicom port the year after, which was developed by Fupac and published by Datam Polystar. Finally, the game saw a PS1 rerelease in 2002 by Success and Fupac. The Super Famicom version was considered for a US localization with the name CyberSlider and a complete graphical overhaul which was ultimately canceled. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The goal is to keep clearing blocks as they warp in, matching three or more blocks of the same color or symbol. Matching three blocks of the same symbol and color provides a much larger bonus to the player's score, and is the key to reaching the higher score ranks. The player character can hop on top of blocks to push those adjacent out of the way. The protagonist can push any number of blocks in a row at once, as long as there is space to do so. The outer border cannot hold blocks, but the player can use it to maneuver around the playing field easier.Eventually, the screen will fill with blocks and after a brief window to ensure no additional moves can be made, the game is over. The player is then rated based on their total score and number of cleared blocks, and given a rank. Points are earned for every block removal, with bonuses for combos and same color/symbol matches. </div> "

It had the MLB license but not the license of the Player's Union, so fictionalized names (other than Griffey's) were used for the athletes.

The balloons can be opened by jumping up and grabbing their string as they pass overhead. As well as the four icons, the balloons provide bonuses such as extra coins and health recovery items. If Kid Klown doesn't manage to grab all four icons, he must restart the stage (though his icon progress is saved - he'll only need to find the ones he missed).  </div> "

King Arthur's World,Argonaut Games,Jaleco,"September 4, 1994",snes,King Arthur's World is a side-scrolling strategy game where the player must utilise various units and their abilities to help King Arthur safely reach the end of each level.,3030-12248,12248,0,1992-11-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/king-arthurs-world/3030-12248/,," <div> Overview : King Arthur's World (known as Royal Conquest in Japan) is a puzzle-simulation-strategy game in which the player controls King Arthur and his army as they first take charge of their homeland and then head off to bizarre new worlds in an attempt to recover the Holy Grail.King Arthur's World is one of the few third-party games on the Super Nintendo to support the SNES Mouse peripheral. </div>  <div> The World : Set in a land from Arthurian literature, the game levels range from standard English countryside, a cavernous goblin cave system, to a cloud realm rife with fantastic beasts. </div>  <div> The Goal : The player's task is to guide King Arthur from his starting base, to the leader of the enemy forces, using the various skills that his army provides to overcome obstacles such as spike pits, enemy troops and even marauding giants. </div>  <div> Gameplay : King Arthur's World plays in a manner similar to Lemmings, in that it is a side-scrolling, unit management game with a focus on keeping as many of the King's men alive as possible. Units are given directions through the use of a cursor, a feature made easier by using the SNES Mouse.The gameplay is initially a simple A to B scenario, set in the English countryside and towns, with the occasional castle. This chapter is finished with a battle against a giant ogre, the first and easiest boss. In the following chapters, the player is required to negotiate ever more complex maps, with multiple levels, teleporting doors and increasingly harder to kill enemies. Each boss battle is more difficult than the last, and needs a large amount of firepower to defeat. </div>  <div> Player Units : Arthur is the most important unit of the game and has many uses, in addition to being powerful and hard to kill. He is the only unit the player can use to pick up keys, gold and he alone can defeat the enemy leader. Unfortunately though, if he dies the mission is failed. It's generally advised to keep him away from harm and let the other units do the grunt work. </div>  <div> Enemy Units : Knights are the basic ground troop, effective in hand-to-hand combat against most non-boss enemy types. Though they cannot fight a lot of monster types, they are very powerful against units they can reach. The player can temporarily boost their attack for a split second, allowing them to hit harder. </div>  <div> Bosses : These ranged units are extremely effective against most enemies, though they are fragile and must be kept back out of harm's way. Capable of firing in three different trajectories, they can hit enemies blocked by the terrain or inside of towers with a little bit of trial and error. Their usefulness is decreased in the underground goblin levels, as the low ceilings prevent them from being as versatile. </div>  <div> Environmental Hazards : The only unit capable of healing player units is the Wizard. He has three support abilities, used to bolster the players army. These are Health, Strength and Invincibility. The spells affect any allied unit on screen, and last for a limited time. Invincibility does not protect units from instant death situations like spike pits, crushers or zombie units. </div> "

At the start of the game up to two players can choose from five character classes which include an Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric or a Dwarf, using the original D&D Edition ruleset that categorized Elves and Dwarves as separate classes. Each class gets an upgraded weapon or armor every couple of levels. The player(s) can fight through hordes of goblins, skeletons, fish people and more, and at the end of each level there is an encounter with a boss creature.The King of Dragons was ported to the Super Nintendo in 1994 for the US, Japan and Europe. This port was developed by the nascent Prism Kikaku, which had split off from SunSoft the year previously. Prism Kikaku would change their name in 1995 to Nippon Ichi Software. </div> "

Most of the fighting mechanics in the game resemble those in professional wrestling games (including a grappling system and the use of pinfalls to win). Similar to beat-'em-ups, defeated players can re-join the match by continuing, restoring their stamina while not restoring the enemy's.Unlike most fighting games, a second player cannot interrupt a single-player game for a versus match. Instead, joining in immediately turns the game into a two-on-two co-operative mode. Before the game starts, players can optionally change it into a single one-on-one versus match (where the losing player can restore their stamina by continuing).It was released for the Neo Geo AES for all regions during their respective launch dates. It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 and the Sega Genesis in 1993, both by TAKARA. Unlike most Neo Geo games of the era, this game did not receive a port to the Neo Geo CD.The game would eventually be followed up with a sequel, titled King of the Monsters 2: The Next Thing, which adds more elements from beat-'em-ups.

Three successors of the monsters of the previous battle (Super Geon, Cyber Woo, and Atomic Guy) must fight to retain control of the planet.The game was released for the Neo Geo AES on June 1, 1992 and was ported to the Neo Geo CD (in Japan only) on September 9, 1994 (as a launch title). The game was ported by TAKARA for both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (on December 22, 1993) and Sega Genesis (exclusively in North America on 1994). The Genesis version removes all beat-'em-up elements, making it a traditional one-on-one belt-scrolling fighting game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The mechanics of the game allow for basic punches and kicks, but the biggest damage comes from throws. When a player approaches a similarly sized opponent, this will result in the two grappling. The winner of the struggle throws his opponent. Against the computer, the grappling system is rather unbalanced and it is difficult to come out of a grapple victorious, especially against the later bosses of the game. Each stage of the game must be completed within a set time limit and every stage has a boss characters at the end. </div>  <div> Characters : Player vs. computer - The single player story mode; a second player can join in.Two players vs. computer - Two players team up to cooperatively play through the story mode.Player 1 Vs.

After Sega's successful attempt to bring Puyo to the West with Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Sega Genesis, Nintendo wanted to port Puyo Puyo to the SNES with a Nintendo character. Hal Laboratory, Inc. and Compile developed Kirby's Avalanche and the game brought many firsts to the Kirby franchise. The soundtrack contains remixed tracks from Kirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Course, with one track from Puyo Puyo. It is the first game in the Kirby series to have voices, and Kirby and other characters between rounds speak in complete sentences. It is also the first game to call Meta Knight by his name and where he appears with his current design with sword and cape. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like Puyo Puyo, gameplay consists of two colored blobs falling from the top of the screen. To clear these blobs, the player must match at least three same-colored blobs horizontally or vertically and any blobs left over will fall into the space. If blobs are cleared in a chain reaction, the opponent has boulders fall on their screen, which can only be cleared by popping blobs directly next to the rocks. The number of boulders dropping on the opposing player depends on how many blobs were popped and how many chain clears happened in the chain reaction.Kirby drops boulders on Whispy Woods.The single player campaign has 3 practice levels and 13 stages, each against a different Kirby enemy. In it, King Dedede challenges Kirby and other Dream Land denizens to a Avalanche Contest in Dream Fountain. There is also a versus mode.This game was re-released on Virtual Console in 2007 for 800 Wii Points.

The object of the game is to destroy all of the enemies while aiming for the hole in the fewest number of shots.As well as enemies, Kirby needs to be wary of various obstacles and ""traps"". Like any game of mini-golf, achieving the lowest score possible is preferable, with bronze/silver/gold medals unlocked depending on the accumulated score for the course. Kirby has health, lost each time a shot is made and regained upon defeating enemies, as well as lives. If Kirby loses all his lives, the game is over and the course needs to be restarted.The game also allows for two players to compete with each other. The player to sink their ball Kirby first will receive additional health as well as a more desirable score. The player can also target the other player's Kirby, causing them harm. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Kirby will curl in on himself, and then with the aid of arcing lines the player can decide on the appropriate trajectory of the ""ball"". After deciding on the angle and spin Kirby should follow, a power meter appears which the player uses to time how much power the current ""shot"" will have.Kirby loses his vacuum ability in this game, replaced by the involuntary metamorphosis of Kirby to new forms by colliding with special enemies. Once familiar with the effects of this collision-transformation, the player can use these newly acquired powers to achieve maximum enemy clean-up/Hole in One. As Kirby fells his foes, the final enemy will instantly transform into the course hole. Utilizing the environment, which includes back-bouncing sides, as well as a little geometry, is the key to victory. </div>  <div> Abilities : Fireball - Kirby becomes a ball of fire, able to gain a burst of speed.Freeze - Allows Kirby to slide and can freeze water.Hi-Jump - Lets Kirby jump high in the air.Needle - When used, needles poke out of Kirby and will halt his movement.Parasol - Will slow Kirby down when used, in the air it will allow Kirby to float to the ground.Spark - Can be used to get through Whispy Woods or Kracko.Stone - Turns Kirby into a stone, either stopping him dead in his tracks or making him slide down if activated on an incline.Tornado - Kirby becomes a tornado allowing him to pass obstacles and enemies, and curve his current trajectory.UFO - Kirby turns into a UFO for 10 seconds and can fly in any direction.Wheel - Gives a great boost of speed and allows Kirby to skip across water and through sand traps. </div> "

It is the last game published by Nintendo for the SNES in North America and was unreleased in European regions.The fifth main installment of the Kirby series starring the pink puffball of the same name, Kirby's Dream Land 3 expands on Kirby's Dream Land 2 by adding three new animal friends: ChuChu the Octopus, Nago the Cat, and Pitch the Bird. While most of the features added in Kirby Super Star were not included (including ""Helpers"" and ability hats), a computer AI or second player can join in as Kirby's friend Gooey (a friendly blob previously found in Dream Land 2) at the cost of some of Kirby's maximum vitality.Set after Kirby's Dream Land 2, the game's story has the planet of PopStar (where Dream Land resides) invaded by black cloud-like objects which possess many inhabitants, including King Dedede and his minions. It's up to Kirby, Gooey, and their animal friends to find a way to rid PopStar from the Dark Matter.Kirby's Dream Land 3 was digitally re-released via Virtual Console for both the Wii on January 5, 2009 and the Wii U on May 8, 2013.

The game is very, very loosely based on Arthurian legend. It follows the exploits of the legendary  Arthur and two of his Knights of the Round (Table), Percival and Lancelot, as they attempt to overthrow the fictional King Garibaldi and take his throne.Knights of the Round plays as one would expect. All three characters have an attack button and a jump button. Pressing the attack button several times performs powerful combination attacks while pressing back attack allows the knights to block most incoming attacks. By pressing both attacks and jump at the same time, the knights will perform a powerful spinning attack which will knock back nearby enemies, at the expense of some of the hero's life bar, making the attack useless. The life in that life bar could be replenished by eating a hearty helping of turkey which could be found in crates and other smashable objects. Additionally, the knights can mount  horses, which vastly increases their combat prowess.Though the characters play very similarly, each knight has strengths and weaknesses.Arthur is the balanced character, with decent speed and strength.Lancelot is a speedy character, with great maneuverability but less strength.Percival is a large, slow character, who has very powerful attacks.Knights of the Round does have a feature rarely seen in brawlers. As the knights dispatch enemies, they gain experience which increases their stats and makes them more effective in combat. As each character levels up, their appearance changes as well. For instance, Percival starts the game with blond hair and a bare chest. As he levels up, he shaves his head and gains bulky armor. </div> "

Lagoon,Kemco,Kemco (JP/EU)Seika Corporation (NA),December 1991,snes,"A top-down, action RPG developed by Zoom.

It first debuted on the Sharp X68000 home computer in 1990 before becoming one of the Super Nintendo's earliest JRPGs the following year.The two versions have a handful of differences: the X68000 version has animated cutscenes, and the player character Nasir automatically attacks enemies if he attacks them at the right angle (similar to early Ys games) whereas in the SNES version the player needs to swing Nasir's weapon with a button. </div>  <div> Story : Taken directly from Lagoon's North American SNES manual, the story for the game is as follows:Who shall rise to face this threat?Long ago the peaceful land of Lakeland fell under the influence of an evil spirit, bringing despair to all. With compassion, the gods descended and vanquished the evil spirit with the sacred Moon Blade Sword. In hopes of restoring peace to Lakeland, the gods brought two babies to the land: one who represented the forces of Light, and another who represented the forces of Darkness. A sage named Mathias was charged with the responsibility of raising the two children as equals in the hope that their different, but equivalent strengths would guarantee the balance of the forces of Light and Darkness. But, the moment Mathias reached out to grasp the two children, the evil Zerah appeared and took the child of Darkness, hoping to raise the child to overcome the forces of Light. This, while Nasir, the Champion of Light, was raised by the wise Mathias, the other child grew up under the questionable tutelage of Zerah. Fourteen years have passed. Nasir, raised near the village of Atland, has become a bright youth and accomplished swordsman. Mathias has taught him well. One day, an evil spirit possessed the water on which the people of Lakeland depend, bringing sickness and disease. Demons infest this once peaceful land.Mathias spoke haltingly.""It is for this day that I have trained you, Nasir. You must discover what evil force possesses and fouls the water. Restore the purity of the water or sickness and death will plague our land. This is your destiny!""It is now your responsibility to rescue the land from the evil forces. You will face a myriad of enemies. Only by skillfully using your sword, magic, and wits will you prevail. Go forth, your quest awaits you. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players can move Nasir in one of four directions, and can also attack, jump, jump and attack, defend, or cast magic from each position. Of particular note, is the short range of Nasir's melee attacks. This is offset by the range of his magic attacks, which can reach the whole length of the screen. However, players may not rely on magic attacks alone. Certain enemies are invulnerable to it (like bosses), and must be dispatched with melee attacks.The basic gameflow of Lagoon follows a town-overworld-dungeon pattern. In each town, players can talk to the various townspeople, buy items and equipment, and advance the game. On the overworld, players fight their way from location to location, sometimes having previous areas being permanently blocked. In the dungeons, which range from such locales as mines, castles, dungeons, and various elemental caves, players must seek items, equipment, and the bosses within.The equipment and item system borrows heavily from Ys. As such, Lagoon has a very limited set of equipment to find, with only five pieces of equipment per sword, armor, and shield categories. However, unlike Ys, Nasir's color palette and equipped shield change to reflect the equipment status screen icon. Also borrowed from Ys is the five rings. Players can discover the Protective, Power, Defensive, Curing, and Time ring, all of which mirror the abilities found in Ys. The Protective Ring increases defensive power, the Power Ring increases offensive power, the Defensive Ring makes Nasir invincible to lesser enemies, the Curing Ring gradually heals Nasir, and the Time Ring stops the movement of weak enemies. During Nasir's adventure, he will also discover a plethora of other permanent and consumable items that will aid him in his quest. Of note, is that the status and equipment screen can not be accessed during boss fights, so players must prepare for battle beforehand.Lagoon's magic system uses a mix and match system to give players a total of 16 magical attacks. Broken down into Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder categories, players must find both a crystal and staff to make use of magical attacks. Scattered throughout the game is the Earth, Sky, Star, and Moons Staff, and the Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder crystal. By mixing up which crystal and staff Nasir has equipped, different attacks with different properties can be activated. This important, as certain enemies are either immune or weak to certain elements.Much like any other RPG, Lagoon utilizes a health, magic, gold, and experience point system. Defeated enemies automatically give players a set amount of gold and experience, and once a certain experience threshold is met, Nasir will level-up, gaining additional stats. Of note is the game's health and magic system, that regenerate, in any environment, as long as Nasir is standing still.Exploration in Lagoon is done much the same as in any other top-down platformer. Players must navigate a multitude of environments, each with their own set of obstacles and dangers. Players must also be careful of pitfalls, or bottomless pits, as they will instantly kill Nasir if he falls into one. However, this is offset by the game's save system, which allows players to save anywhere outside of a boss fight. </div>  <div> Characters : This is the list of major characters in Lagoon, taken directly from the manual:Nasir - Born to be the Champion of Light, the protagonist has become a skilled swordsman under the tutelage of the wise Mathias. He displays intelligence and courage beyond his years.Mathias - Skilled in the art of the sword and in the ways of magic, he raised Nasir from infancy.Thor - Aligned with the forces of Darkness, he is known as a skilled swordsman and for the fact that each of his eyes is a different color.Zerah - an evil warlock, he is aligned with the forces of Darkness.

The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past,Nintendo,Nintendo,"April 13, 1992",snes,The third installment in the Zelda series makes a return to the top-down 2D gameplay of the original. Link must travel between the Light and Dark Worlds in order to set things right in the kingdom of Hyrule.,3030-10276,10276,0,1991-11-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past/3030-10276/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Originally released in Japan in 1991, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was released in North America and Europe in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). This game featured the series trademark hero, Link, on a quest to save the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, who had been kidnapped by the evil wizard Agahnim. The game marked a return to the series' 2D overhead roots, which Zelda II: The Adventure of Link departed from. It is considered by many to be the best game in the series, though it is not quite as popular as Ocarina of Time. </div>  <div> Story : Link battling Agahnim.The story of Link to the Past follows a young boy named Link who is contacted by a princess named Zelda. After rescuing her from a wizard named Agahnim, Link sets out upon a quest to retrieve the Master Sword and three mystical pendants. With the Master Sword eventually in-hand, Link defeats Agahnim, but is subsequently teleported into the Dark World version of Hyrule. Once there, Link sets off to find and defeat Agahnim yet again, but must first find the seven descendants of the Seven Sages throughout temples in the Dark World. After freeing the descendants throughout the Dark World, Link does battle with the Agahnim, and upon defeating him finds Ganon where Agahnim's remains lie. The final battle against Ganon ensues. </div>  <div> Gameplay : World map of the Dark World.A major concept in Link to the Past is that a dark version of everything in Hyrule exists in a realm known as the ""Dark World"". This world was once a Sacred Realm until Ganon arrived and used the Triforce to bend the realm to his will, covering the land with darkness and despair. Throughout the course of the game, Link must travel between the Light World and the Dark World in order to complete certain puzzles and progress through the game's story. Some areas of the Light and Dark worlds are identical, but others have minute differences that alter Link's ability to travel through them. At first, Link is transformed into a reflection of his inner self whenever entering the Dark World, which leaves him unable to use items or wield a sword and shield, but eventually he collects an item that allows him to maintain his form while traveling through the Dark World (much to the surprise of the world's natural inhabitants).World Map of the Light World.About half of the game takes place in the Light World. Link must win three pendants in order to obtain the Master Sword, as well as defeat Agahnim at the top of Hyrule Castle. Most of the second half of the game takes place in the Dark World, where Link must revisit the seven temples which differ from their Light World counterparts significantly. While traversing the Dark World dungeons, it is sometimes necessary to travel to the Light World to manipulate an object, and then return to the Dark World where a consequence of that manipulation will allow Link to progress further. An example of this can be found when traversing the Dark World's water temple, as Link must first open two flood switches in the Light World's counterpart in order to allow him to venture further.While this ""parallel world"" mechanic made its first appearance in Link to the Past, it certainly wasn't the last Zelda game to use it. Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess both included the ability to travel between parallel worlds, and many believe that this mechanic played a significant role in the success of each of these Zelda games.The structure of the game adheres to the formula of the series, of which this game is the prime example. Exploration of the towns and overworld is broken up by dungeon exploration, which involves solving puzzles and facing enemies, including a boss and a miniboss. In each dungeon, Link will find a new item that will allow him to solve puzzles or reach new areas, while also providing a key role in besting that dungeon's boss. </div>  <div> Equipment : Fighters SwordMaster SwordTempered SwordGolden Sword </div>  <div> Items : Link's tunicThe Blue Shield protects against arrows and rocks.

Some abilities are specific to certain tribes, while others are reused several times.The land of each tribe has its own visual style and music, and some unique challenges.Psygnosis published the game in the US and Europe.

In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.Gameplay additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines. </div>  <div> Levels : Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)Space </div>  <div> Trivia : ArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker*returning from the original Lemmings.

The stages, in order, are ""The Bank Robbery"", ""Chinatown Assault"", ""The Hijackers"", ""Drug Dealers"", and ""Chemical Plant"". In each stage, Don has to shoot criminals that pop out of the scenery before they shot him. Occasionally an innocent civilian appears instead, and by shooting them Don loses health and penalizes the player's final score. Don can collect additional weapons throughout the level that are more powerful than his standard gun, such as a magnum or shotgun, but they are lost if hit.In the Arcades, players used a plastic revolver-like light-gun to play the game, called the ""Konami Justifier"". The gun was colored blue for Player 1 and pink for Player 2. The standard gun in the game has 6 shots, and to reload the gun players has to fire the trigger off-screen.

The goal is to guide all Vikings safely through each level. The game's originality is due to the fact that the player controls three different characters (although only one at any given time), and must make use of their individual abilities and their combination to solve puzzles and progress. The game featured infinite opportunities of retries in case the player were to lose one of the Vikings. Much of the game's appeal came from the humorous inter-level dialogues of the characters. </div>  <div> Characters : The three vikingsThis game sets players with the task of completing each level by using 3 different characters. This requires the use of each Viking's abilities as well as getting them all to the area's exit point alive.Erik the Swift - As his name states, he is very agile being the only one of the three that can run or jump. That fact alone makes him invaluable in a platformer but, additionally, if he gets a large enough start he can do a speeding charge helmet first into things. It will damage enemies but it's main use is in destroying breakable walls.Baleog the Fierce - He lives up to the name by being the main fighter. He has a sword to strike down enemies and a longbow to kill from afar. His bow serves the dual purpose of being able to activate buttons from a distance. In certain stages, Baelog is able to set his arrows on fire to solve various puzzles.Olaf the Stout - He carries on him a large round shield as tall as himself which lets him stop almost any attack. This can halt approaching enemies, or protect the vikings from any oncoming projectiles. His shield can also be lifted above his head. Not only will this work as a platform allowing Erik a higher jump from, but it manages to serve as a hang glider for Olaf, allowing his stout frame to float through the air. </div>  <div> Areas : The game consists of 36 stages, divided into several chapters, each with a different theme.Stages 1-4: The vikings attempt to escape from the alien shipStages 5-11: The vikings are in prehistoric Earth, fighting dinosaurs and cave-menStages 12-17: The vikings are in ancient Egypt, and now have to contend enemies which are able to leap over Olaf's shield, as well as poisonous insects.Stages 18-25: The vikings are in a modern factory, and must navigate more automated environmental hazards.Stages 26-33: The vikings are in ""Wonderland"", and area that operates off of cartoon physics.Stages 34-36: The vikings are back on the alien ship and must now fight Tomator, the leader of the aliens. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,8,8,8, adding, ""Another excellent job from Interplay!

For every step Maxim takes the enemies move a set amount, and in a set pattern, based on what they are. Making contact with an enemy initiates battle. Depending on Maxim's orientation when he touches an enemy the player may end up with a preemptive strike or be ambushed. This is why when navigating the dungeon it is important to be cautious and plan out how to approach the enemy, especially in particularly crowded rooms. Players can also use some of the puzzle-solving items to stop an enemy's movement for a specific number of steps.Combat is turn-based, but includes ideas such as the IP (""Item Points"" or ""Ikari Points"") gauge, which is perhaps similar to early versions of the Limit Break. The IP gauge fills up when attacked, and some pieces of equipment can convert this power into a special ability, ranging from powerful attacks to unorthodox healing spells. The most unique aspect of combat is that all spells can have any number of targets, but more targets decreases the magic's potency. This gives flexibility; a spell can focus on one enemy or attack everything except the monster that can reflect magic. The maximum number of characters available in combat is four, and there is no choice between party members offered; it is guided by the storyline. There are also creatures in the game world called Capsule Monsters. Only one of these at a time can join the other characters in battle, and they cannot be controlled. </div>  <div> Ancient Cave : The dungeons are also riddled with a variety of switch, explosive, and positioning based puzzles. When solving these puzzles the player are given various items to help out:ItemDescriptionResetThis restores the room to its original state, thereby rectifying mistakes on puzzles such as pushing a block into a corner.ArrowUseful for flipping switches at a distance, they also stun enemies for a certain number of steps.BombThis standard bomb destroys vulnerable walls and debris within its blast radius, though later some things are un-bombable.Fire ArrowFire arrows function as normal arrows with the additional advantage of setting anything it touches aflame; this is useful for cutting down large amounts of grass quickly. Some puzzles are based around destroying regenerating grass.HookLike the Hookshot of Legend of Zelda fame, the hook enables Maxim to attach to objects in order to cross gaps. It also stuns enemies.HammerDestroys rocks and bombable things from a distance, also pushes heavy objects that might be unreachable.These items are given to Maxim through the normal progression of the story and are required for progression through dungeons and puzzles. The puzzles are initially simple but can become very difficult later in the game. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Capsule monsters are creatures Maxim discovers that joins his party in battle. They have levels, abilities, and also multiple forms. In order to reach a new form, the capsule monster must be given items. They request special items that work more effectively than average items, but feeding them high-end items may spoil their palate and result in them constantly demanding expensive items. In order to grow into their final form they require a unique item whose sole use is to level up the capsule monster. </div> "

This version adds Minnie Mouse as an alternate playable character, a save system, extra minigames (which include two-player modes via link cable), and connectivity bonuses accessed through the separate GameCube title Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse.The original Magical Quest is the first in a trilogy of SNES platformers collectively titled ""Disney's Magical Quest"" and was followed by The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey and Minnie two years later. The third game was originally only released in Japan in 1995; it eventually received an international release on GBA as Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey and Donald. </div>  <div> Story : Mickey is in the park playing catch with his dog Pluto and his friends Donald and Goofy on a beautiful day. When Pluto chases after an errant pitch, Mickey follows him straight over the edge of a steep cliff and lands in an unfamiliar fantasy world nestled among the clouds. He is soon greeted by a kindly old wizard who explains that Pluto has been kidnapped by the powerful Emperor Pete. Ignoring the wizard's warning to turn back, Mickey resolves to travel to Pete's castle and rescue Pluto. The wizard agrees to help by scattering items throughout Pete's kingdom which will aid Mickey in his quest. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Magical Quest follows the standard format of most 2D platforming games. Mickey is maneuvered with the D-pad and jumps with the B button by default; he can jump onto most enemies' heads to stun or damage them. The game does not feature a run button, but players can increase Mickey's speed and jumping distance by walking across a downward-sloped platform until he breaks into a run.Pressing Y will cause Mickey to grab certain nearby objects. Pressing Y while holding something causes Mickey to throw the item; objects thrown in this way will usually spin along the ground until they bounce off a wall, giving Mickey the ability to attack enemies at range. After jumping onto their heads once to stun them, Mickey can also pick up certain smaller enemies to use as projectiles. However, Mickey cannot pick up objects while wearing a costume; instead, pressing Y with a costume equipped will activate the costume's special ability. Players can cycle between Mickey's available costumes with the L and R shoulder buttons before pressing A to confirm their selection.The player begins the game with three Hearts representing Mickey's hit points, although choosing the ""Easy"" difficulty setting boosts Mickey's starting health to five Hearts. By collecting Big Heart health upgrades throughout each stage, Mickey's health meter can be increased to a maximum of ten Hearts. </div>  <div> Stages : Wizard: Mickey's first costume allows him to fire bolts of magic energy straight ahead, which can be charged before firing. However, each shot also consumes a portion of his suit's magic meter. The Wizard costume also allows Mickey to breathe underwater and ride magic carpets.Firefighter: Donning these boots and helmet gives Mickey a powerful firehose that extinguishes most flames on contact. The force of the water can even push certain blocks around to create new footholds. Similar to the Wizard suit, Mickey must replenish his limited water supply with items.Mountaineer: The final costume equips Mickey with a grappling hook that can attach to platforms and special grapple points, allowing players to scale dangerous cliffs and cross wide gaps. Unlike the other two costumes, the Mountaineer suit does not feature an energy meter and its special ability be used freely. </div> "

The visual style of the game is borrowed its SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font to the overworld city maps. </div>  <div> Story : Even the greats have bad days.Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan. </div>  <div> Gameplay : From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather additional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.Save the world, or keep the flute. Hmm...Players also have access to an overworld map, showing the street connections, as well as Koopa and warp pipe locations. Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece. </div> "

Whereas Mario is Missing! taught younger players geography, Mario's Time Machine teaches world history instead. The SNES version was developed by The Software Toolworks in late 1993, and the NES version by Radical Entertainment the following year. There are minor differences between the two versions as a result.The goal is to take stolen items out of Bowser's museum, time-travel to the time period from which they hail (the location and date are important when imputting coordinates) and piece together information about the artifact and its owner by talking to NPCs from that era before they can be given back. </div>  <div> Story : Title Screen of Mario's Time MachineSomehow Bowser has gotten a hold of a time machine, called the Timulator. Using the Timulator he goes back in time and steals many important artifacts of history. Bowser places all of these artifacts that he has taken into what he considers to be ""the greatest museum of all time."" Bowser will then destroy the Timulator after he is done building his collection, and therefore change the course of history forever.It is up to Mario to stop Browser from completing his collection of artifacts and return them to their respected time eras. If the artifacts are not brought back history will be changed permanently. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The basic gameplay consists of players talking to historic figures and solving basic puzzles in order to return artifacts to their rightful owners. Each object in Bowser's museum has attached to it a basic explanation of a famous historical figure, including the date and location the item was taken from. By imputing these co-ordinates into the Timulator, Mario can travel back to the correct era with the item in tow.When travelling back in time, players play a brief minigame where Mario travels trough an endless ""ocean of time"" with many whirlpools, and the objective is to grab enough mushrooms and deposit them into a wave pool in order to succesfully travel back in time. If Mario does not collect enough mushrooms before falling into a whirlpool or has imputed the wrong year/location combo, he travels back to the prehistoric era where he must play a version of Donkey Kong in order to get back to the museum where players can opt to try again.Once reaching the correct era, Mario can walk around and ask NPCs for hints. Most will provide at least one of the clues necessary to fill in the explanation provided with the item, and once this report is correctly filled in the item is given to its correct owner and the player can move onto the next. </div>  <div> Historical figures : The NES version is a little different from the original SNES version. In this version, Mario has to fight Koopa Troopas in platforming sequences before being allowed to travel back in time. Mario also has no idea which artifact goes in which period (the SNES version informs the player as soon as they collect one of the artifacts) and must use the NPC hints to figure out which artifact is the right one for each period. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : The historical figure that are featured in the game are:Cleopatra VIIElizabeth IFerdinand MagellanIssac NewtonJoan of ArcJohann GutenbergLeonardo de VinciLudwig van BeethovenMahatma GandhiMarco PoloMichelangeloPlatoThomas Alva EdisonThomas JeffersonWilliam Shakespeare </div> "

Math Blaster: Episode 1 is the first in the series to be introduced to video game consoles: the game was released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1994. The story follows Blasternaut as he flies through space converting trash into fuel and searching for his lost robot friend named Spot. Spot has been kidnapped by a yellow three-eyed trash alien who is wanted for ""space-dumping and Spotnapping"". The player must use basic addition and subtraction skills to progress through the game. There are several different levels within the game with different objectives, but they all boil down to basic arithmetic problems. The player can select the difficulty of the math problems as they increase in arithmetic ability, moving up to multiplication and division.The game was followed by a sequel: Math Blaster: Episode 2: Secret of the Lost City. This sequel did not see a console release. </div> "

The game features Donald Duck in the role of Maui Mallard, a private detective, as he passes through a tropical island on a case to look for a missing idol. He occasionally transforms into Maui's alter-ego Cold Shadow, a ninja duck that uses his staff to traverse levels. While it is clearly Donald Duck in the guise of another character, the North American versions of the game make no reference to Donald and call him Maui Mallard throughout.In this platformer, the player controls Maui Mallard through a series of levels in which the goal is to collect as much of the scattered treasure as possible. Along the way, they must also avoid enemies and various environmental hazards (apparently water hurts this duck) </div> "

Simulating the behavior of NES hardware, the game features the classic graphical style (including sprites ripped straight from the original games and an option to enable graphical glitches due to too many sprites displayed), classic sounds and soundtrack (including a dedicated sound system that can alter the music based on sounds being played), and simple gameplay mechanics.New features that were previously downloadable content in Mega Man 9 are included in the base game, including Proto Man as a playable character (who can block small attacks from the front, slide across the ground, and charge up his arm cannon, at the cost of less damage resistance) and a harder difficulty mode (unlocked by beating the game). The game also introduces an easier difficulty level to the franchise and a variety of mini-stages (Challenge Mode) included to test the player's abilities. The game also includes three new downloadable bonus stages (featuring a boss from the Game Boy games), a downloadable ""Endless Attack"" mode, and Mega Man's rival Bass as a unique playable character (who has a weaker rapid-fire arm cannon that can shoot in eight directions, and a dashing manuever to assist in long jumps).Set in the year 20XX, the game takes place sometime after the events of Mega Man 9 (in which the humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeats the evil Dr. Wily for the ninth time). An outbreak of a mysterious virus is disabling robots worldwide and causing some robots to go berserk. After a month, Dr. Wily requests help from Dr. Light and Mega Man with claims that he was building a machine that develops an antidote to the disease, only for the machine to be stolen by the infected robots. With Roll succumbing to the outbreak, both Mega Man and his brother, Proto Man, must help Dr. Wily retrieve parts to his machine, which are guarded by several berserk Robot Masters. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like in previous Mega Man games, players control Mega Man as he charges horizontally and vertically through levels, eliminating enemy robots and avoiding spikes and pitfalls, in order to reach boss battles against the Robot Masters. Upon defeating a Robot Master, Mega Man receives a new ability (by absorbing the boss's power), which aids him in progressing through the game.Instead of Mega Man, players can also choose to control Proto Man (who was previously a DLC character in Mega Man 9) or Bass (via DLC). Proto Man has the ability to slide (previously used by Mega Man between Mega Man 3 and Mega Man 8: Anniversary Edition), charge his arm cannon (previously used by Mega Man between Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 8: Anniversary Edition), and use his shield while jumping (to absorb enemy projectiles). However, he takes twice as much damage from attacks and cannot fire more than two shots on the screen at one time. Bass has the ability to dash (similar to slide, only trading the decrease in height for a farther jump), fire his default blaster in any one of eight directions (at the cost of not being able to move while firing), and the ability to fly around the screen (in an ability that replaces Mega Man and Proto Man's ""Rush Coil"" ability). </div>  <div> Robot Masters : Randomly throughout the stage (and by random enemy drops) are pickups that aid the player in progressing through the level. Each pickup varies in size (small and large) and utility (boost in health, boost in weapon energy). In rare occasions, players can find Extra Life powerups and special Yashichi powerups (which refills the players health and the weapon energy of all weapons, previously only seen in Mega Man). Players can also collect and manually use special refill tanks, including Energy Tanks (which completely refills the player's health), Mystery Tanks (which either completely refills the player's health and weapon energy for the player's current weapon or (if both are full) turns all the enemies on the screen into Extra Life powerups), and, introduced in Mega Man 10, Weapon Tanks (which completely refills the weapon energy for the player's current weapon).Introduced in Mega Man 7, players can pick up scrap bolts either randomly throughout the stage or by random enemy drops, which serve as the game's currency. Players can buy extra lives, refill tanks, and special items. Special items include the ""Shock Guard"" (a one-use item which protects the player from one hit against objects that cause instant death (except pitfalls)), the ""Energy Balancer"" (in which players who pick up a Weapon Pellet, while equipping either the default cannon or a weapon that has full energy, has it's effect go into the weapon with the lowest amount of energy), the "" Beat Call"" (a one-use item that protects the player from one fall in pitfalls, known as "" Treble Rescue"" for Bass), the "" Eddie Call"" (Mega Man only, a one-use item that summons Eddie to give a random helpful item), the ""Guard Power Up"" (a one-use item that causes the player to receive only half the damage from enemy attacks for the remainder of the level). Mega Man can also buy an item that removes his helmet, which introduces the challenge of Mega Man taking twice as much damage from enemy attacks. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The standard release of the game includes multiple difficulty settings, previously as downloadable content on Mega Man 9. Along with a harder difficulty, the game also introduces a new easier difficulty, which aids players over most of the game's deadly jumps, replaces certain enemies with weaker variations, restricts certain enemy and Robot Master abilities, and restricts the amount of damage the player can receive. The new easier difficulty also adds new save points towards the end of the game (in which players in other difficulty modes must progress through a long set of levels without entering shops or saving). However, playing the game on this difficulty setting does not earn players ranking on the online leaderboards.Mega Man 10 also introduces a new ""Challenge Mode"", in which players must complete and master 88 specific challenges ranging from progressing through a special level to defeating a boss. In addition to these goals, there are also special goals for most of the challenge, which requires the player to complete the challenge without taking damage. Some of these challenges, such as fighting bosses, must be unlocked by reaching that specific boss in certain difficulty settings. Players are given a ranking on the screen listing the challenges, which is determined by how far the player progressed through the list of challenges. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Like traditional Mega Man games, eight Robot Masters must be defeated before the player can progress to the main boss levels. Defeating each Robot Master gains the player a special ability that consumes its own ammo counter. Mega Man 10 includes three extra Robot Masters (the ""Mega Man Killers"") from previous Game Boy games for it's Special Stages. Defeating them grants only Mega Man access to their weapons in all game modes. </div> "

As the Maverick rebellion kicks back up, X must destroy a new group of Mavericks while hunting down the remains of Zero (taken by the ""X-Hunters"", a trio of powerful Mavericks consisting of Serges, Agile, and Violen).Along with upgrades to the game's mechanics and graphics, the game includes an in-cartridge enhancement chip (Cx4) that allowed the game to use limited 3D wireframe graphics (including rotating and scaling effects). This technology would later be used in Mega Man X3.The game was later released on the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console on June 14, 2012) and Wii U (via Wii U Virtual Console on January 2, 2014). It was included in the Mega Man X Legacy Collection. </div>  <div> Upgrades : X, using a Light Capsule to get an upgrade.Like the previous game, X can find rare large blue Light Capsules, scattered throughout the game, which show him a holographic message from his creator, Dr. Light. Depending on which Capsule X finds, Dr. Light briefs him on what the upgrade does before allowing him to step into the Capsule to receive it (giving him a shiny new replacement piece for his armor).Helmet Piece - Allows X to use his ""Item Tracer"", in which a cursor (shown on the screen) automatically zooms in to hidden passages. Found in Crystal Snail's stage.Body Piece - Allows X to perform the ""Giga Crush"" technique, which clears all enemies on the screen (but uses a gauge that only fills up by taking damage and can only be used once per level). X also takes 50% less damage from attacks. Found in Morph Moth's stage.Arm Pieces - Allows X to both charge up his special weapons (for an alternate, more powerful effect) and grants him an X-Buster on his other arm (allowing him to further charge his standard X-Buster, which fires two consecutive super-charged blasts that can cut through enemies). Found in Wheel Gator's stage.Leg Pieces - Allows X to dash in mid-air. Found in Overdrive Ostrich's stage. </div>  <div> Bosses : Along with the four Capsules above, the game includes a very hidden fifth Capsule which grants X a powerful ability (in similar vein to the secret ability in the previous game).If he manages to reach a certain point in the third stage of the X-Hunter's fortress after receiving all four armor parts and obtaining every Sub Tank and Life Up powerups, and then following a specific path (covered in spikes), he can reach a Capsule in which Dr. Light grants X the power to perform a Shoryuken (made famous by Ryu and Ken of Capcom's Street Fighter series).By inputting a specific combination (forward, then down, then down and forward, then the Attack button) while X is on the ground and has a full Life Energy gauge, X performs a powerful close-ranged rising uppercut that can deal serious damage to bosses. Earning this ability is not saved in the game's password system. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Based on the crab, Bubble Crab (known as Bubbly Crablos in the Japanese version) controls a subterranean base located under the deep sea.

It is the last game in the franchise to feature the original art and gameplay style of Mega Man X (as well as the password system).Set sometime after the events of Mega Man X2 (where X and the rebuilt Zero defeat the Maverick Sigma for the second time), the Maverick rebellion becomes neutralized due to the technology of Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler. Reformed Mavericks form an utopia near the scientist (named Dopple Town) and lived peacefully before they suddenly go berserk and cause mayhem. Believing Doppler to be responsible, X and Zero must defeat the eight Maverick leaders of Dopple Town and foil the mad scientist's plans (while surviving his henchmen, Bit and Byte, and a mysterious Maverick).An enhanced version of the game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan (on April 26, 1996) and Europe (published by Virgin Interactive on March 1997).

Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,December 1993,snes,Return to the gunner position of the ST Falcon in this sequel to the mecha light-gun shooter Battle Clash.,3030-3484,3484,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/metal-combat-falcons-revenge/3030-3484/,," <div> Overview : Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge is a sci-fi light-gun on-rails shooter developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America on December 1993, and in Europe on 1994.It is the sequel to the 1992 game Battle Clash and, like its predecessor, requires the Super Scope peripheral. Along with expanding the story, this entry includes a revamped ""shot charging"" mechanic (where players can charge their shots up even further for more powerful shots), a tutorial mode, an two-player asymmetrical versus mode (where one player controls the attacks of the enemy ST with a controller), and a hidden alternate ST (the ST Tornado).The game is set three years after the ST Falcon, piloted by Mike Anderson, defeated the Battle Chiefs and ended the reign of Anubis and his ST Thanatos in his moonbase Luna. As the world began to heal, Anubis resurfaces and the Falcon is deployed again to stop him. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each fight requires that the player wear down the enemy ST's health bar. There's usually several ways to do this, but the goal is often to find the quickest and most damaging means to take down the opponent before they can do to the same to the player's ST. This involves exploiting weak points, building up the energy bar for powerful targeted shots, using the limited supply of bombs and intercepting the enemy's shots to mitigate damage intake.Due to the game's combat heavy nature, accuracy is important. To help compensate for potential issues sensor alignment or bad TV placement, the game follows its title screen with a gun calibration to ensure the player can correctly aim from their position. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Battle Game The Battle Game is effectively Metal Combat's campaign mode, which pits players in their ST Falcon (or Tornado if a cheat code is entered) against the top ST combatants of various regions of Earth. After all of Earth's top combatants are defeated, the player will move on to space to fight the Battle Game ruler Thanatos. What they will instead find, are plot twists abound.Players engage in combat with enemies in a one on one setting, using the Super Scope to fire on their opponents. The player's ST is capable of firing very weak rapid shots (typically used defensively to shoot down enemy projectiles), and charged shots of varying power depending on how long the shot is charged for. The most powerful charged shot available to the player is the Treble Shot, which can be used to cause massive damage to enemy weak points, as well as wipe most enemy projectiles off the screen in a single shot.Aside from the basic rapid and charged shots, the player can also acquire special one-use power ups. At the end of each battle, the player will be rewarded with a bomb (which carries over to the next fight), and at the end of most battles the player will be upgraded with a special single shot power (such as a temporary shield, or a power boost). Players may hold a maximum of five bombs, and as many special items as they'd like, although they can only bring two special items into battle (bombs must be brought into battle and are automatically added to the players weapon list).Each opponent ST that the player faces will have a weak point of some kind. These weak points can be found in one of two ways, depending on the enemy: The enemy ST will either perform an action that will cause the weak spot to glow and be given away, or, the player can fire a treble shot at the enemy and expose their weak point. Typically hitting a weak point with a treble shot will destroy that area on the enemy ST. However, because some weak points can only be exposed with a treble shot, the only possible follow up is to hit the spot with a weaker charged shot.Other individual parts of an enemy ST, such as the arms or legs, can be destroyed, allowing the player to cripple an enemy part by part. Rather then be adversely effected by losing parts, some enemies will simply fire powerful shots from their missing parts, making this a sometimes risky tactic.A cheat code may be entered at the title screen to unlock access to a second ST, named Tornado. Tornado's weapon systems charge shots much more rapidly at the cost of needing to charge ten times before firing a treble shot (or in this case, more of a decible shot). The ST Tornado also has a much lower defense in exchange for this offensive power. In addition to combat changes, some areas of the plot are changed to accommodate the new ST and pilot.Time TrialsIn Time Trials, the player selects their difficulty level (Low, Medium, or High), which determines the three opponents they will face during the time trial. The player then fights the three opponents for the difficulty level they have selected, and at the end receive a cumulative fight time. In each fight, the player is given a single bomb, and no special power ups. If the player's ST is destroyed during a fight, their time of defeat is kept should they decide to continue, and is added to their total fight time when the level is subsequently finished.Training ModeTraining Mode allows the player to replay each ST's respective tutorial missions from the start of the game. </div>  <div> Enemy STs : Combat GameCombat Game allows for two player combat; one player uses the SNES Control Pad to control an enemy ST of their choosing, while another player uses the super scope to fight them like a normal enemy.Using the XYAB buttons, the control pad player can use one of four attacks in their ST's arsenal, and using the D-Pad they can control the movement of the battle. Like single player CPU battles, the control pad ST can be crippled and has weak points. The last player with health remaining wins.Time TrialsMultiplayer Time Trials play exactly the same as single player time trials, with the exception being that both players are given a chance at defeating each enemy. At the end of three rounds, a cumulative time is totaled for each player, and the player with the lower time wins. </div> "

Metal Warriors,LucasArts,Konami,April 1995,snes,Metal Warriors is mech combat 2-d Side scroller in which the player pilots several mecha in either single player or 2 player versus player mode.,3030-15559,15559,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/metal-warriors/3030-15559/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : As one of Earth's last remaining citizens, the player join a group of warriors who fight for Earth's safety, the Metal Warriors. Players pilot a giant mech around side-scrolling levels, saving other stranded citizens, and fighting off enemy mechs belonging to the Dark Axis. The player can pick up power ups as well as exit his vehicle and pilot new mechs, which are scattered across the game's vast levels. The game's story unfolds in detailed, anime-like cutscenes that introduced every level. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Metal Warriors presents a side-scrolling experience that is surprisingly tactical (especially in multiplayer), since the player can eject from his mech and enter new fighting machines that aren't occupied. Every mech has its own set of weapons and handles in a completely different way. It also has large stages than most of its contemporaries, and could be punishing at times as losing at the end of a stage meant the whole thing needed to be played all over. The stages take place in a variety of locales, from jungle and arctic climes, to defending the allied battlecruiser in space.Players can take command of any mech that isn't occupied by an enemy. Unoccupied mechs show up as gray, standing in a forward-facing, inert pose. Outside of a mech, the player is just a little man with a jetpack that offers him unlimited flight, armed with a pea-shooter and incredibly fragile. Typically, outside the mech the player can take ten hits, though hits from mech-sized weapons do far more damage. Players can't harm mechs with their rifle, though the segments of the game that require the player to eject - say, to flip a switch - often don't pit him against a mech, just enemy soldiers.Each mech has its own set of weapons and moves, though they all have long-and-short ranged attacks. In general, close combat attacks does more damage, though the ranged options are just as destructive and satisfying.The power ups scattered throughout each level can greatly change the way a mech handles and make it far more deadly if used in creative ways. For example, a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher can give the more agile mechs some extra punch, while an anti-gravity powerup allows slower vehicles to reach areas they'd have trouble getting to. </div>  <div> Vehicles : The first mech the player pilots; that the player begins every mission in the Nitro. The Nitro is the easiest mech to handle with an accurate, rapid-fire plasma rifle that shoots in straight lines and does decent damage, as well as a jetpack that allows for lengthy bursts of flight. For close quarters combat, the Nitro is equipped with a lightsaber-esque beam sword, and, for defense, an energy shield that the Nitro can drop behind it, even in flight. It will stop bullets and damage anything that runs into it. </div>  <div> Powerups : The Havoc is burlier and faster than the Nitro, but lacks the ability to fly. Instead, it zips along on skates and can jump extra far, if the pilot allows some room to gather some speed. This makes it a great mech for quick hit-and-run maneuvers, especially if there is a health kit is nearby. Further reinforcing the Havoc's aggressive feel is its weaponry: a scatter-shot, rapid-fire machinegun and an axe-blade-on-a-chain that does great damage and has decent range. For defense, the Havoc has a simple metal shield. While not as tricky as the Nitro, the Havoc can take more hits. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : The least maneuverable, the Prometheus takes a little more skill to pilot as it's slow and cannot jump. It does, however, have a massive artillery cannon on its shoulders, which fires highly damaging shells that burst into shrapnel. The player can control when the shell bursts, holding down the button until he wants it to explode. For close combat, the Prometheus has a devastating flamethrower that'll continue to burn an opponent for a second or two even after they get out of the fire. Defense is handled by a 360-degree shield that'll soak in plenty of incoming damage.Since the Prometheus can't jump, it relies on two key features for aerial defense as well as maneuverability. It can deploy floating mines above it that'll do some damage to flying opponents, and a bridgelayer to help it clear chasms (as well as box opponents in). The bridge-blocks can be destroyed. </div> "
Michael Andretti's Indy Car Challenge,Genki,Bullet-Proof Software,September 1994,snes,A racing game that is sponsored by Micheal Andretti and was released for the SNES. The game is representative of Indy car racing and was developed by Genki and published by Bullet Proof Software.,3030-26638,26638,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/michael-andrettis-indy-car-challenge/3030-26638/,," <div> Overview : Michael Andretti's Indy Car Challenge is an open-wheel racing game based on the Champ Car (then known as CART, or Champion Auto Racing Teams) circuit that was released for the Super Nintendo in both Japan and the US, with the US version being released first. The game was endorsed by 1991 Champ Car champion Michael Andretti. The player takes part in a series of sixteen races in the single-player mode across Australia and the US, and can customize their vehicle before each race with regards to tire pressure and gear ratio.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Michael Andretti's Indy Car Challenge is a standard racing game in most respects with the player controlling the car with the D-pad, while accelerating with the X button, moving in reverse with Y button and braking with the A button. If using a manual transmission car, the R button is used to shift up and the L button to shift down. The player must also keep an eye on their fuel gauge or else the race will end prematurely. To refill the fuel gauge, the player must drive into the pit, and after several seconds goes by the pit crew will change the car's tires and refill the fuel gauge. There are also two difficulties: normal and pro. Normal is the default difficulty and can be changed in the options menu. The game also has no save feature and instead relies on a password system which is provided at the end of each championship mode race. The passwords that are given in the Championship mode can then be entered later on the main menu.There are three distinct modes of play in Michael Andretti's Indy Car Challenge. In each of these modes the player is given advice by Micheal Andretti for the track they are about to race on, and are given an option to choose between a default setting or custom setting. The default setting is Michael Andretti's recommendation setting for the current track, while the custom setting is made to change the car's balance (tire pressure), top speed (down force), and acceleration (gear ratio) from the default recommendations. </div>  <div> Modes of Play : Championship mode is a series of 16 races that starts in Australia and ends in Monterey, California with a majority of the races taking place in the United States and a few in Canada. Before every race the player can complete a qualifying race to determine their stating position. At the end of every race the player is given a points total for the position they placed in. The driver with the most points at the end of the circuit is declared the winner.  </div>  <div> Tracks : Just as it sounds, Practice mode allows the player to practice for 5 laps on any of the 16 tracks in the game. </div> "

It was later published in Europe by  Ocean in 1995.Players control then-retired professional basketball player  Michael Jordan as he embarks on a quest throughout the titular Windy City to rescue fellow basketball players from the forces of mad scientist Dr. Maximus Cranium. Aiding him is an endless supply of basketballs as weapons (including special ""power balls"").Along with its premise and use of the sport of basketball in platformers, the game is known for its inclusion of  product placements for the  Wheaties and  Gatorade brands, both of which have items the player can pick up to restore health. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chaos in the Windy City plays like a traditional side-scrolling platformer, where players control Michael through numerous stages split into four main areas: Holding Cells, Laboratory, Factory, and the Riverview amusement park. Each area has an extra auto-scrolling train level in-between them (where he must fight off the paparazzi). An eleven-digit alphanumeric  password system can be used for keeping track of the player's progress.Players guide Michael around using the D-Pad (for forward and backwards movement, crouching, climbing ladders, and activating some types of moving platforms), the left shoulder button (for running), the B button (for standard jumping), and the X button (for unique ""slam jumping""). The standard jump can be improved by running beforehand, and can be used alongside Up on the D-Pad to grab onto pulley objects.Michael can only attack enemies by throwing basketballs at them. Once a basketball leaves his hand, he wields another one automatically. He throws one in a straight line (in the direction he's facing) by pressing the Y button. When activating his unique ""slam jump"", pressing the Y button causes him to throw one in a downwards trajectory (which can be used both for clearing out enemies that are too short and for dunking on special basketball nets scattered throughout the level). Basketballs are used for destroying enemies, breaking through walls, and activating switches.The A button is used to open doors and activate certain switches. Most doors and objects are locked, and require key items (iron, gold, green, red, or yellow) found along the level. Michael can only use one type of key items at a time, which must be switched in the inventory by using the Select button. Along with basketball coins (for extra points), doors commonly hold items and enemies. Rarer doors throughout each level hold captives (kidnapped basketball players who are automatically rescued after giving the player some advice) and special portals (which warp the player into special timed bonus rooms when entered). </div>  <div> Lives and Energy : Along with normal basketballs, Michael can throw special types of basketballs (called ""power balls"") by collecting special power-ups. However, Michael can only carry a certain amount of power balls (with the exception of the Smoking Earthquake Ball), which is instantly filled when collecting that power ball's power-up. Pressing the R button switches between the different types of basketballs. Each power ball has a unique ability when thrown and when ""spiked"" (by performing a slam jump).Knuckle Ball - White ball (similar in appearance to a  baseball) that goes through solid walls and enemies, returning to Michael like a  boomerang shortly after (picking up any items it touches). Maximum of eight shots.Ice Ball - Blue ball that freezes most enemies into a solid chunk of ice (which shatters after Michael throws another ball at it), which can be used as platforms. Frozen enemies thaw out over time. Spiking an Ice Ball coats part of the floor with a layer of ice, making it slippery to enemies. Maximum of six shots.Rebound Ball - Purple ball that bounces around. Spiking a Rebound Ball splits the ball into two bouncing balls. Maximum of six shots.Flame Ball - Bright orange ball that deals double damage to enemies. Spiking a Flame Ball creates a trail of flame on the floor. Maximum of five shots.Heat-Seeker Ball - Golden ball that tracks down enemies who are within range. Spiking a Heat-Seeker Ball splits the ball into three heat-seeking balls. Maximum of five shots.Iron Ball - Black ball that functions like a  bowling ball, immediately rolling across the floor to hit enemies. Spiking an Iron Ball causes the ball to explode, dealing a point of damage to all enemies on the screen. Maximum of three shots.Smoking Earthquake Ball - Red ball that deals massive damage to all enemies on the screen when spiked. There is no maximum amount of shots, and collecting that power-up gives Michael one Smoking Earthquake Ball. </div>  <div> Backboards : At the beginning of the game, Michael starts with a certain number of  lives (3-5, depending on the difficulty) and three energy globes (that function as  health). Each energy globe represents two units of health (shrinking after one hit of damage and turning blue when empty). Along the way, the player can find items that not only give Michael back his energy, but can increase the number of energy globes.Gatorade Bottle - Common item that restores one-half of an energy globe (one unit of health).Wheaties Box - Uncommon item that restores one energy globe (two units of health).MJ Heart - Rare item that restores three energy globes (six units of health).Golden Heart - Very rare item that increases the maximum number of energy globes by one.High-Tops - Rare sneakers that give the player  temporary invincibility.If the player depletes all of the energy globes, Michael loses a life and must restart from the previous checkpoint. Along the way, the player will encounter basketball  coins, which has similar function to coins in the  Mario franchise. A silver coin is worth 1 coin while a gold coin is worth 5 coins. Every 100 coins collected gives the player an  extra life. Players can also earn extra lives by collecting rare Golden 23 icons. </div> "
Mickey Mania,Traveller's Tales,Sony Imagesoft,"October 1, 1994",snes,A side-scrolling platformer featuring Disney mascot Mickey Mouse that is inspired by his long history in animated films.,3030-16875,16875,0,1994-10-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/mickey-mania/3030-16875/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (known in Europe as Mickey Mania) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Traveller's Tales (in conjunction with Psygnosis) and published by Sony Imagesoft for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on October 1994 and for the Genesis and Sega CD on November 1994. The Japanese version was only released for the SNES (by Capcom) and Genesis (by Sega).Originally developed to celebrate the 65th birthday of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse, the game has the titular mouse adventuring through some of his various short films (from the 1928 Steamboat Willie to the 1990 The Prince and the Pauper) as he must find his past selves, rescue his dog Pluto, and defeat Pete.Made in collaboration with Disney, the game is one of the few games to feature digitized animations from Disney-affiliated animation studios (from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida division in collaboration with Creative Capers Entertainment).Each subsequent version of the game includes new sequences and minor additions. For example, both the Sega console versions add a new hidden bonus sequence (based on the 1935 short film The Band Concert) and a ""spiral staircase"" sequence in the second level. The Sega CD version features both redbook audio and digitized voice samples of Mickey, as well as an extra sequence before the final boss.The game was later ported on March 1996 to the PlayStation in Europe (as Mickey's Wild Adventure), featuring enhanced graphics and graphical effects and a new ""chase"" sequence in the fifth level (where Mickey is pursued by Willie the Giant). This version was later digitally re-released via PlayStation Network on December 13, 2011 (in Europe) for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mickey Mania is fairly typical of the side-scrolling platform genre. Players guide Mickey from left to right through levels, passing obstacles through  jumping or  solving puzzles. Enemies can be defeated either by jumping on them or by  throwing marbles at them. The game is famously difficult: a lot of this difficulty is because some of the game requires a lot of precise timing and many of the enemies are hard to defeat without taking damage.At the top left hand corner of the screen is Mickey's Glove. The number under the glove symbolizes the number of lives the player has remaining and the fingers of the glove show how many hits Mickey can take before losing a life. </div>  <div> Items : In Mickey Mania there are three types of items at Mickey's disposal, each with a different purpose:Stars: These give you 1 health (finger) back per star. If Mickey has full health and gets the stars, they will disappear and he will NOT get an extra life.Marbles: The main tool for getting through most levels in this game. Marbles are everywhere to collect and the serve as a means of hitting enemies and bosses. They are transferable from level to level though Mickey has a holding limit of 99 marbles.Mouse Ears: Mickey's Mouse Ears can come in very handy and are in secretive locations throughout the game. They replenish one full life, regardless if you have not previously lost a life. </div>  <div> Cartoons Featured as Levels : There are a total of 7 levels to play through in Mickey Mania. </div> "

Players can continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet.As with the first game, Isles of Terra continues the tradition of including a full color map of the world that the game was taking place on (in this case, the Isles of Terra).Aside from the enhancements made to the interface, a new ""escape"" option was created within the game called ""Mr. Wizard"". If the player finds themselves lost, they can call upon his services and be teleported to their hometown. The cost, however, is an experience level.The combat heavy nature of the series continues with this entry although there were many puzzles and secrets to be discovered within the game. Unlike Might and Magic II, Isles of Terra does not offer an option to import characters from its predecessor. Players either start with an all-new party or the pre-built one provided.Special sub-quests for character classes are also included in the game to enhance their abilities.As was often the case at this time with the PC related releases of the title (such as on MS-DOS or the Amiga), a number of items were included with the game to enhance its immersion:A journal written by one of the main NPCs, Corak the Mysterious, who describes the mythology of the world, how its races came to be, his own quest, and the origin of each class within the game.A Quick Reference card that describes the basic controls, interface, and listed spells.The map of the Isles of Terra.An adventurer's notepad.Two new classes also make their debut in this game: the Druid and the Ranger.The eight default PCs of Isles of Terra all made an appearance in a future Might and Magic game set in the same universe, in a sense concluding their story arc. They appear as high level ""travelers"" (having arrived from space) in the intro of Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor, and eventually become allies/enemies of the player's party. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Might and Magic is a mix of fantasy and sci-fi elements, something that players only discovered once they have fought their way to the end of the previous titles only to discover fantastically advanced super science behind the veil of their respective worlds. Isles of Terra is no different.At the end of Might and Magic II, the players discover that the world of CRON is actually a massive space-faring colonization vessel developed by powerful beings known only as the Ancients. Sheltem, however, refuses to allow the Ancients to populate CRON as intended, seeing them as inferiors, and decides to send it into the sun instead. Narrowly, the party from that game manages to save CRON although Sheltem escapes.In Isles of Terra, players must put together a party to stop Sheltem's plan before he completes his quest to destroy that world as well. In it, they discover that Terra was the place where the nacelles of CRON and VARN (the worlds of the two previous titles) were headed in order to colonize it. Following the notes of the mysterious Corak, they discover that the world of Terra is divided into many different islands, towns, and castles, each filled with their own quests. After many harrowing adventures through each one, they finally gain access to the mysterious pyramids that are dotting its surface and discover the true nature of Terra.Near the end, the party manage to get into the Central Control Center beneath the last pyramid and find that Corak and Sheltem are engaged in a duel to the death. Their arrival manages to distract Corak for a moment allowing Sheltem to slip away into a transport tube. Following Corak's lead, the party discover more of the truth behind the Isles.Apparently, they were considered ""The Grand Experiment"" of the Ancients in ""using the technology of Elemental Manipulation to create a completely viable ecological and social microcosm. This microcosm was then to be transported to a distant biosphere (Terra) to supplant it's indigneous ecosystem."". The game goes on to describe that the experiment needed a central control capable of handling unexpected anomalies.It is then that the party discover the truth behind Sheltem: he was created by the Ancients to be the Overlord and Guardian of Terra but his conditioning was critically flawed. He did see himself as the Guardian of Terra, but not of the colonization experiment initiated by the Ancients. As a result, he rebelled against the ""army"" that ""invaded"" his world who were actually the colonists. The Ancients managed to contain him, but he had escaped and was determined to undermine the Grand Experiment.From Sheltem's failure, the Ancients used these lessons to create Corak, a new Guardian. With his conditioning, the Great Experiment was successfully launched on its journey through the Void. Corak was to stop Sheltem and then oversee the colonization of Terra as its Guardian and Overlord.Sheltem, however, did not see his inability to stop Terra's colonization as a detriment. Instead, he found an opportunity and succeeded in disturbing the balance between the three alignments of men, a balance that Corak must now repair upon his return. However, his plan against Terra only gave him a small sense of satisfaction as he quickly sought to sabotage the other experiments that the Ancients had scattered throughout the Void.Both Sheltem and Corak have escaped through transport tubes but a third has been prepared for the party to pursue the two to the next world where Sheltem intends to continue his mad quest. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay is centered around a six person party with the world seen from a first person perspective utilizing rudimentary 3D graphics for the outdoor locations and indoor dungeons. Monsters along with certain other encounters are displayed as 2D pictures. As was the norm at the time for several RPG titles, movement is centered around a grid based scheme which meant 90 degree turns and square-based movement forward or back.The game is also considered quite detailed as well as difficult. Players are required to maintain a stock of food in order to be able to rest outside of an inn to regain hit and spell points. Bashing open locked doors often set off traps if they are not disarmed. Leveling is not automatic.Once a character has earned the requisite experience, it must be spent at a training ground in order to improve their statistics and abilities. Gems are often required to cast higher level spells and characters can also die from old age (natural or not), although the proper spells could alleviate its effects. Characters can also be afflicted with a number of debilitating conditions which often prove incredibly fatal to starting parties. Sex and alignment can also restrict certain characters from entering specific areas or in equipping certain items.Isles of Terra also allows the player to save anywhere they wish outside of an inn.Towns and dungeons are no longer limited by the 16x16 grid although continue to use a grid-based movement system with 90 degree turns. Several other enhancements were also made:Searching is no longer required to find loot following combatVisible enemy encounters give players a chance to avoid unwanted battles or use ranged attacksImproved graphics based on VGA displaysSynthesized speechThe mouse was integrated into the controls (on PCs)Automapping was now provided </div>  <div> Combat : The manual of the game took the form of a journal describing the world, its classes, and its races through a fictional story told from the point of view of one of the title's main NPCs, Corak.The game allows the player to select among five different races in building their characters. As with most other RPGs, certain races have slightly better statistics in certain areas and others, but the emphasis appears to be more on how resistant each one is against certain conditions such as falling prey to sleep spells or being more resistant to poison.The five races are:Human - Strong resistance to fear and some resistance to sleep spells. Average statistics make this race a good choice without any glaring weaknesses.Elf - They have a strong resistance to fear and are generally excellent at spellcasting.Dwarf - Some resistance to poison, stronger and hardier than the other races. They make excellent fighters but poor spellcasters.Gnome - Nimble and quick, they can make great paladins and decent spellcasters.Half-Orc - They have a moderate resistance to sleep spells, are decently strong, and can make great fighters. </div> "

The game is named for the Major League Baseball Players' Association, the license to which was acquired for this game, allowing it to use actual player names from the 1994 MLB series. However, the game lacks the MLB license to accompany it, and so all the team names are simply city names.The game was later released in Japan as Fighting Baseball in 1995. This localization is notorious for its made up ""American-sounding"" names like Bobson Dugnutt and Mike Truk, as the MLBPA license did not extend to that version. Inexplicably, in 2022's The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror Death Note parody, all of the executives at the corrupt climate change-inducing company that Lisa kills were taken from this game's Japanese roster. </div> "

Mortal Kombat,Sculptured Software,Acclaim Entertainment,"September 13, 1993",snes,"One of the goriest fighting game franchises returns to its roots, introducing a new story that re-tells the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games (with a unique twist).",3030-25042,25042,0,2011-04-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : The legend continues... from the beginning.Mortal Kombat (not to be confused with the original 1991 game of the same name) is a 2.5D fighting game developed by NetherRealm and published by WB for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 19, 2011, for the PlayStation Vita on May 1, 2012, and for the PC (via Steam) on July 3, 2013.Considered a rebirth of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Mortal Kombat drops the 3D fighting game mechanic from previous games and reinvents the 2D fighting mechanic of the first three Mortal Kombat installments, adding new features such as tag-team battles (supporting up to four human players at a time), an extensive battle damage system (which shows player characters getting heavily injured during the fight), and a three-tiered Power Meter (used for enhanced special moves, combo breakers, and powerful moves known as X-Ray Attacks).The game also features new mini-games (such as Test Your Luck, in which players fight a match after a slot machine randomly adds beneficial and detrimental effects to either player), the return of Kombat Kodes (in which both players, during the Vs. screen, can together input a secret code to change gameplay mechanics and other effects of the match), the return of Babalities and hidden characters (that can only be fought under rare conditions), a 300-part series of special matches and mini-game challenges (known as the Challenge Tower), an enhanced training mode, stereoscopic 3D support (for the PlayStation 3 version only), and an online lobby mode for up to eight players (in which the other players, as avatars in the Xbox 360 version and avatar-like characters in the other versions, watch the fight unfold and switch off after each match).The main single-player story retells the events of the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 3 in an alternate universe. Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use). Players start with one-third (one bar) of the meter full, and can fill up the meter by performing special moves, getting hit by an opponent's attack, or getting their attack blocked. In the first round, the first person to successfully land an attack earns another bar of their meter instantly.Enhanced Special Moves (uses one bar) - An enhanced version of a special move that can inflict more damage, add additional attacks, or changes the properties of the move (such as adding armor properties), which is executed by combining the activation of the special move with the Block button.Breakers (uses two bars) - A simple combo breaker that is executed during an opponent's combo by holding Forward and Block as the opponent connects another attack. It immediately knocks down the opponent (though dealing no damage), escaping further combo damage while giving positional advantage.X-Ray Attacks (uses all thee bars) - Executed by pressing either the Flip Stance and Block buttons or the Front Kick, Back Kick, and Block Buttons simultaneously, the character performs a starting attack. If it connects successfully, the character goes into an animated sequence of powerful attacks (that shows close-up X-Ray animations of the damage being dealt internally). Each character has a unique X-Ray Attack, sometimes using special properties (for example, Johnny Cage's X-Ray Attack starts with a counter move, while Stryker's X-Ray Attack starts with armor properties). </div>  <div> Characters : Mortal Kombat introduces tag team combat (in a similar vein to the Marvel vs. Capcom series) to the franchise as an optional feature, pitting two fighters against two other fighters. Unlike 2-vs-2 modes in previous Mortal Kombat games (in with the second fighter can only fight when the first fighter is defeated), fighters can be swapped out on-the-fly, as well as jump in for a quick tag-team attack. When one fighter is defeated, the other fighter on the team immediately jumps in (without the ability to swap out or perform tag-team attacks). Each round ends when both fighters in a team are defeated. In some occasions, matches are played with uneven teams (such as 1-vs-2 matches in Story Mode where the human player is outnumbered).Mortal Kombat allows four human players to form two teams, with each player controlling only one fighter. This mode can be played online (with teams of two local players) and co-operatively in the Tag Ladder Mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with two Fatalities, which are special finishing moves (animations showing an gruesome and painful kill) that can be performed via special button combinations by the winning player at the end of the match. One of these combinations is visible from the start in the character's Move List. The other ""hidden"" Fatality becomes visible in the Move List either when the player performs the Fatality for the first time or unlocks it in the Krypt.Returning from the old Mortal Kombat games are Stage Fatalities (which can only be performed at certain stages and, unlike most 3D Mortal Kombat games, cannot be executed during the middle of a match) and Babalities (which transforms your opponent into a baby, this time showing a cutesy animation of the baby humiliating itself). The combinations of both Stage Fatalities and Babalities are completely hidden, requiring the player to have outside knowledge. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile also each have a hidden Classic Fatality (based on Fatalities from the first two Mortal Kombat games) that can only be performed if the player has downloaded their Classic Costumes. </div>  <div> Special Editions : The traditional Arcade Mode of Mortal Kombat, Ladder Mode requires players to defeat ten opponents, one at a time, each fight increasing in difficulty (though the base difficulty level is chosen before the first fight). The first seven fights are against random opponents in random stages while the final three matches are pre-determined (first Shang Tsung with his alternate costume and the ability to automatically transform into his opponent and two other fighters, then either Goro or Kintaro, and then Shao Kahn). Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> "

Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic ""Toasty!"" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an ""X"" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut). </div>  <div> Characters : Baraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round. </div>  <div>          Liu Kang  : The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no ""endurance matches"" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the ""?"" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the ""Toasty!"" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row).  </div>  <div>          Kung Lao  : Actor:  Ho Sung PakFatality 1: Liu Kang morphs into a screen-high dragon before biting down on his opponent, leaving behind only a standing pair of legs.Fatality 2:  Liu Kang revisits his non-lethal fatality from the original Mortal Kombat, executing a butterfly-kick into the opponent before uppercutting him or her into the air. </div>  <div>          Johnny Cage  :  (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Anthony MarquezFatality 1: Using a downward slash, Kung Lao bisects the victim with the brim of his hat.

He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an ""ice grenade"" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs. </div>  <div>          Kitana  :  (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he ""bursts out"" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand. What remains of the victim is a shriveled, desiccated body.Hidden Fatality: Shang Tsung morphs into Kintaro and, with one powerful punch, knocks his victim's torso clean off of his/her legs. </div>  <div>       Jax  : Actor:  Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Kitana whips out her razor-sharp fan and decapitates her victim.Fatality 2: Kitana plants a lovely kiss on her victim which in fact causes the victim's body to expand to the point of explosion. </div>  <div>          Mileena  : Actor:  John Parrish Fatality 1: Jax claps both of his hands on the victim's head, causing it to shatter into pieces.Fatality 2: Jax grabs ahold of both of his victim's arms and rips them off with one yank.

As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air. </div>  <div>          Raiden  : Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs. </div>  <div>         Kintaro  :  (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes. </div>  <div>         Shao Kahn  : (sub-boss, unplayable)  </div>  <div>         Jade  : (boss, unplayable)Actor:  Brian Glynn  </div>  <div>         Smoke  : (secret opponent, unplayable)Actor: Katalin Zamiar </div>  <div>        Noob Saibot  : (secret opponent, unplayable)Actor: Daniel Pesina </div>  <div> Arenas : (secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)Actor: Daniel Pesina </div>  <div> Versions and Ports : There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation.

It also updates the control scheme (by adding a sixth ""Run"" button) while adding selectable difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos, mid-fight stage transitions, the ""Mercy"" system, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special multiplayer pre-match codes known as ""Kombat Kodes"".Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's ""cyber-assassin"" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.The game later received a major revision in November 1995, known as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, that added new characters (including the return of masked human ninjas), new game modes (including 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), new backgrounds, and updated character movelists. It was further updated on with the console-exclusive game Mortal Kombat Trilogy a year later.Along with 16-bit console conversions (by Sculptured Software) for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and handheld conversions (by Software Creations) for the Game Boy and Game Gear (the latter exclusively in Europe), the original game also received a port by Williams to the 32-bit Sony PlayStation shortly after that console's North American release. The game also received two versions for PCs: a MS-DOS version by Sculptured Software and a Windows version by Williams (the latter being a port of the PS1 version). All of the original ports were released by Williams (with the European version co-released by Acclaim). The game was also included two compilations: the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, and the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures: Deluxe Edition for the PC. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  Mortal Kombat ""X"" Control Panel with the new run buttonThe gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a ""Run Meter"", which limits the use of running.Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a ""chain combo"" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny!The game also introduces the concept of ""Choose Your Destiny"", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different ""towers"", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a ""Kombat Kode"") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an ""Ultimate Kombat Kode""). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working ""Ultimate Kombat Kode"" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character. </div>  <div> Characters : ANIMALITY! Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II). </div>  <div> Arenas :  The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)The original arcade release included 15 playable characters (one of which must be unlocked beforehand), two unplayable boss characters, and one unplayable hidden opponent for a total of 18 combatants.Along with final boss Shao Kahn, eight characters return from previous games in the series.

The player takes on various CPU opponents on a series of courses with a bike and avatar of their choice. While there's no gameplay difference with the avatar, each bike has its own strengths and weaknesses.The game was originally released in a bundle along with Speed Racer in My Most Dangerous Adventures and the Exertainment Bike peripheral from publisher Life Fitness. The player would use the stationary bike while playing, powering the forward momentum of the in-game racers. Cannondale Cup was released without that functionality, allowing the player to play it with a standard Super Nintendo gamepad. Mountain Bike Adventure was released again in 1995 as a separate product for the Exertainment Bike. It changes the names of the characters and bikes, but they remain graphically identical. </div> "

Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special ""powerball"" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found. </div>  <div> Food : There are many types of food that give Mr. Do a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill him!

Ms. Pac-Man,Digital Eclipse Software,Williams Entertainment,"September 1, 1996",snes,"A sequel to the arcade classic featuring Pac-Man's feminine counterpart. The game is notable for having a variety of mazes as opposed to the single maze design in the original game, as well as bonus items that wandered through the mazes rather than appearing just in the center.",3030-6332,6332,0,1982-02-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls). </div> "

He can also upgrade his spear to fire small energy bolts, extending its range. The goal is to make it to the end of each of the eight stages and defeat a boss, which is when new magic spells are acquired.The US version is largely left unchanged, except for a few details in the story and the usual censoring of tanuki testes and Swastika-like manji symbols. </div> "

NBA Give 'n Go,Konami,Konami,November 1995,snes,A basketball ball game published by Konami for the SNES.,3030-11202,11202,0,1995-09-29,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-give-n-go/3030-11202/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : NBA Give 'N Go (JP: NBA Jikkyou Basket: Winning Dunk - ) is a basketball game from Konami that was first released in Japan and soon localized to North America and Europe. It is a reworking of Konami's competitive Arcade basketball game Run and Gun that now includes the NBA license. Players from the 1994-1995 season are included, which omits Michael Jordan due to his temporary retirement at the time. Neither Charles Barkley nor Shaquille O'Neal appear in the game either due to licensing issues. (This was not uncommon at the time; NBA Live 96 did not include Barkley or Jordan either, though they could be automatically generated in the player creator of that game; home ports of NBA Jam did not include Barkley, either.) The Japanese and English versions have different localized voice commentary. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Rather than a horizontal perspective of the court, the player-controlled team member runs towards the screen via the Z-axis to the opposing team's basket and sprites scale depending on their distance from the camera, including the hoop and crowd backdrop. This viewpoint is taken directly from Run and Gun, which allowed two players to compete by sitting on opposite sides of two linked Arcade cabinets. It's the equivalent of the baseline view in modern basketball games, whereas the traditional view on television and of basketball games in this era is known as the sideline view.Sprites don't scale entirely smoothly, with sudden size changes as the camera moves farther from or closer to the sprite. Furthermore, the half-court game is sometimes compromised as the camera cannot provide a view of the entire half court once the ball-handler (or defensive team member under player control) is at or past half court.Players are not easily identifiable on court by jerseys alone--names and numbers are obfuscated and appear as garbled text. Some of the player art is close enough to resembling the real-life player, and the player being controlled (and the player whom is highlighted to receive the next pass) does have he position he's playing over his head. Those familiar with the NBA circa 1994 - 1995, and know players' positions (or at least remember where they may have substituted out of position), it's not entirely difficult to identify the players--but the way this is handled is in contrast to its simulation peers, such as NBA Showdown and NBA Live, where the player has the luxury of jersey numbers on the player sprites themselves.Each court features the home team's logo. However, in the player's perspective.,the logo is facing right-side up. This angling is odd, given that the game's camera view is from the baseline, and not from the traditional sideline ""television"" angle. (In other words, if you were to rotate a Give N' Go court such that it is viewed from the ""television"" angle, the logo would appear to be rotated on its side.) </div> "

Along with a custom name, uniform color, wacky head, and a ""nickname"" for the announcer, players can distribute their attributes from a limited point pool (which gets larger the more that player wins).The game later received ports for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis on November 1996, both ported by Funcom and published by Midway themselves (rather than Acclaim, who previously published ports of NBA Jam). It was later ported by Midway Studios San Diego and Director's Cut International to the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Windows PCs in early 1997.Earlier versions of NBA Hangtime (as well as the home versions) included a NBA trivia quiz after each game for bragging rights, additional attribute points (home version only), and a chance to win prizes (arcade version only). The game later received an update in November 1996 as NBA Maximum Hangtime, updating the roster to match the 1996-97 season while adding new secrets and a new ""hot spots"" system, where each basketball player has a hidden spot on the court where they shoot more accurately.

Developed by EA Canada for seventh-generation game consoles, this rebirth brings back the gameplay, aesthetics, and gratuitous secrets of the original 1993 arcade game.",3030-29664,29664,0,2010-10-05,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-jam/3030-29664/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : BOOMSHAKALAKA!NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 arcade basketball game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports for the Wii on October 5, 2010. Originally a Wii-exclusive, it was later released on November 17, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring upgraded HD visuals and online play. (This version was originally planned to be a feature-limited downloadable title included with new copies of the unreleased NBA Elite 11, but was later made a retail release.)Unlike previous Acclaim-developed installments of the franchise, the 2010 installment features gameplay and aesthetics reminiscent of Midway's original NBA Jam. (With help from the original designer, Mark Turmell, who worked with EA Tiburon at the time, and Tim Kitzrow, the iconic announcer of the original game, who shouted famous catchphrases such as ""Boomshakalaka!"" and ""He's on fire!"").Building upon the 2010-2011 NBA roster, the game features a ""Remix Tour"" campaign (featuring new crazy features such as power-ups, new camera angles, and boss battles) and special ""legend"" characters (legendary former NBA players). The game also brings back special guest characters and easter eggs from the original, such as former president Bill Clinton, hip-hop band Beastie Boys, and Big Head Mode, while adding new, modern secret characters, such as presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.An enhanced version, titled NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on October 4, 2011. On January 11th, 2013, the online servers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the original game were shut down. </div>  <div> Gameplay : NBA Jam is a fast-pace arcade style 2-on-2 basketball game that plays very similarly to the 1993 arcade game of the same name. Their are no fouls in NBA Jam other than goal tending (interfering with the ball when it is on the way to the basket) and shot clock violation (24 second shot clock expires before a shot is taken). Since there are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.Trail of fireIf the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become ""on fire"" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.Game TypesIn addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 AI opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard's life meter is completely empty, the backboard's glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the ""paint"". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains power-ups. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.Magic Johnson boss battleCampaignsNBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson has the ability to teleport around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters </div>  <div> Standard Roster : The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season.

It also features ""Tournament Mode"", which disables all cheat codes and special characters while reducing the ""rubber-banding"" effect in player-vs-player matches.The game received home console ports through 1995-1996, first for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Gear, then for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Jaguar, Sega 32X, MS-DOS PCs, and Game Boy. These were published by Acclaim, and most were ported by Iguana Entertainment, with the GB version ported by Torus Games and the Jaguar version ported by High Voltage Software. These versions include an updated roster (from the 1994-95 NBA season) and new game options (including power-up icons, ""hot spots"", faster game speed, and an injury system).Both early arcade versions and the console ports are known for building up their list of unique hidden characters, with the early arcade versions including guest characters from the studio's Mortal Kombat series (which were removed shortly after release) and the console versions including some NBA mascots, retired sports icons, the American rap group Beastie Boys, the American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Charles, Prince of Wales.Some of the console ports were later used for the spin-off College Slam, while the original arcade version later received a successor with NBA Hangtime. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the ""Turbo"" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the ""???"" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the ""Quick Hands"" and ""Max Power"" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include ""Power-up"" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : Hotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. ""Hot Spots"" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. ""Power-up"" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant ""on fire,"" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a ""Juice"" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an ""Injury"" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional ""Tag Mode"" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball.

NHL Stanley Cup had the licence to use the logos and names of all 26 NHL teams as well as the Stanley Cup itself. However, lack of a licence from the NHLPA prevented use of actual player names.NHL Stanley Cup employed a unique, 3D perspective where the camera was positioned behind the back of the puck holder. This allowed the player to see down the ice, all the way to the net. If the puck is taken by the opposing team, the camera rotates around to position itself behind the new puck holder. </div>  <div> Game Modes and Options : Title screen showing game modesThe game had three difficulty settings, including Junior, NHL, and NHL Pro. Other options included different period lengths and turning penalties and line changes on or off. The player could also choose between playing a single exhibition game, a best-of-seven series, or a complete season. During season mode, the game kept track of player and team statistics. The player could choose not to play particular games and instead have the outcome determined by the computer. At the end of the season, the player could qualify for the playoffs and compete for the Stanley Cup.   </div>  <div> Gameplay : Face off at center iceApart from the unique camera angle, the gameplay in NHL Stanley Cup was fairly standard for its time. When the player has control of the puck, they can skate, shoot, pass, or dump the puck into the opposing zone. When shooting, the player could actually aim shots to specific parts of the net or choose to fake a shot. On defence the player can perform poke checks, hip checks, and shoulder checks. At any time, the player can make line changes or choose to pull the goalie.The rules of the game conformed fairly well to the standard rules of actual NHL hockey. Players could be called for a variety of penalties, and would be sent to the penalty box accordingly.One of the more noticeable gameplay flaws was the players ability to score almost score at will, when approaching the blue line in the middle of the ice, the player could hit the button to dump the puck effectively popping it up into the air over the goalie's head. </div> "

There are three variations: Attack (in which the contestant use a lacrosse stick to toss balls into a large net), Slam Dunk (in which the contestant shoot a basketball into a hoop), and Spirals (in which the contestant lobs a football through a ring).Players have a limited amount of time to score as many goals as they can, with each attempt having players adjusting their position (by holding Left/Right), launching themselves off of the pad (by holding Down until the power meter is filled, and then holding Left/Right to adjust their velocity), shooting their shot (by pressing the B button at the right time), and recovering back onto the pad (by holding Down as they return). Pressing both X and Y instead of B launches a Special shot worth double points.In two-player mode, both players play simultaneously, shown side-by-side. </div> "

The player, as Kyle, must recover his girlfriend Erin from the vampire Nosferatu after the undead creature spirits her away in the middle of the night and takes her back to his castle.The game takes elements from both Konami's Castlevania franchise and Prince of Persia. Kyle moves through the castle using his fists, acrobatics and wits to avoid traps and fight Nosferatu's minions, most of which are classic horror archetypes like Frankenstein's Monster. Like Prince of Persia, the player has a hard time limit to get to Erin and Nosferatu in a far tower, but this time limit can be extended by finding special hourglass power-ups. Kyle can also find crystals that increase his power (red), restore health (green) or increase the length of his health bar (blue). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The control actions are simple. Move. Attack. Jump. However, by using different combinations of these controls, the player is able to perform a deep array of actions. Walking, running, long jumps, short jumps, quick hops, climbing up and down, and collecting items are all able to be performed through button input combinations.Combat is equally simple to learn and takes skill to master. Only the Y button is used to attack. But, with combinations of moving and jumping, a simple four punch combo can have uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, jumping kicks, slides, dodges and knee strikes added to them. </div>  <div> Characters : By collecting items that are hidden throughout the levels, the player is able to make Kyle stronger and more capable of taking on the opponents that he is faced with.Red Crystal: Red crystals are powerful items that increase Kyle's combative ability. For every 3 crystals collected, Kyle's attack speed and power increase. Along with that, the attacks that he is able to perform during a basic combo are expanded as well. If Kyle takes any kind of serious damage, or is knocked over, he will lose 1 red crystal.Green Crystal: Health restoratives. If Kyle loses any health during his adventure, it will be restored by collecting these.Blue Crystal: Rarely found and hidden well, a blue crystal will increase Kyle's maximum health by 1 point. Be sure to find as many as possible.Hourglass: Increases the time left to complete a level by several seconds.Treasure Box: These chests can be found all around the game's levels. Some in obvious sight, some hidden. Regardless, they usually contain helpful items. Be sure to check a box several times, since they often hold more than one treasure. Sometimes, a ghost hides in a treasure box and will reduce health and remove one red crystal. </div>  <div> Enemies : The levels of Nosferatu are linear, but with branching paths. The first level is completely linear. All subsequent levels have branching paths that all eventually lead to the same end of the level boss fight.The Dungeon: The first level of the game. Teaches the basics of what to do and how to do it, as well as introduces several low-level enemies and traps.Castle Hall: The second level is slightly tougher, introducing more advanced platforming, tougher traps and pressure plates that can open doors and gates.The Gallery: Level 3 has more hazards and more powerful enemies than the first two, and introduces enemies who patrol back and forth and attack on sight.Dungeons 2: A more advanced version of the first level. It has all of the same traps and enemies as the first visit to the dungeons, as well as some new ones.Castle Hall 2: A more difficult version of the first castle hall. This area introduces even more new traps, and treats its platforming sections as puzzles that need to be solved.Nosferatu's Castle: The lair of the titular villain.

It should be noted that despite being the first game released in the Ogre Battle series it is actually the fifth game in terms of storyline. Taking place twenty four years after the formation of the brutal Zetegenian Empire, the people of the old kingdoms live under constant persecution by the current regime. As the ambitious leader of the rebel army the player is tasked by the old wizard Warren to gather their forces and liberate the people from oppression. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game was unique at its time being an odd hybrid of real time strategy and RPG. The game progresses linearly (aside from certain secret levels unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements during battle) leading the player from one battle to the next. Before these battles the player can manage his army with a variety of options. Most importantly is the formation of squads, which are created by grouping together units. There are a large variety of units ranging from doll masters to werewolves as well as several special hero units (though many are just improved versions of existing classes). Squads consist of three to five units placed on a three by three grid, with their placement on this grid dictating their actions in battle. As with most RPGs, units gain experience and level, often leading to more advanced classes. Units can also be equipped with items to further increase their effectivenessBattles take place in real time on large maps with the player starting at his home base and fielding his squads into the battle at a cost. The player controls his squads by issuing move orders which they fulfill to the best of their ability. The objective is to reach the enemy's stronghold and liberate it by occupying that space while preventing the enemy from taking the player's own base. Along the way towns can also be liberated to help the player's cause. Towns provide information, units to hire, items to buy, and income. When an enemy squad comes into contact with a player's squad the two squads ""fight it out"" in a quick computer controlled battle. The units in both squads act out whatever actions their placement dictates, with the squad suffering the most damage or losing their leader unit being declared the loser and as a result being pushed backwards on the map. The user has limited control in these battles with only a few options such as using a limited number of tarot cards (magic spells) or giving the AI a certain routine to follow such as attack the leader. This continues until one side's home base is captured. The story is presented during battles through conversations when encountering certain squads (generally the boss squad sitting their home base) and also through brief cut scenes between battles.While the game is lauded for its depth in terms of customization it is also criticized for its brutal learning curve. Many features are poorly documented or explained, and as a result can only be discovered via trial and error. Many a player would unwittingly progress quite far into the game only to realize his forces have been improperly trained and are vastly inferior when compared to the enemy. The game also featured multiple endings, however due to the aforementioned poor documentation; Especially in regards to the reputation and alignment system, many players would receive a ""bad"" ending, where they themselves have become a blood thirsty tyrant with many of the characters they encountered plotting against them. Whether this is some kind of social commentary about the nature of war or simply poor game design has yet to be and probably never will be determined.Despite these criticisms the game is loved by fans for its massive depth, endearing charm, and poignant storyline. </div>  <div> Trivia : The band Queen is said to have inspired Yasumi Matsuno when creating the series. References to the band's second album, Queen II, can be seen within the Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen. Most notably are the songs Ogre Battle and March of the Black Queen which obviously served to inspire the game's name, not to mention Let Us Cling Together the subtitle to Ogre Battle's sequel. </div> "

If the Pac-Man piece is situated in an area where he can easily catch any ghosts he will remove them from the grid.The game offers a standard ""Normal Mode"" in which the game plays out as described above, as well as a ""Puzzle"" mode in which the player is given a limited number of Pac-Man to eat the various ghosts. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,7,7,8 and 8 out of ten.

To reach them, he has to find some or all of the power-ups: each increases his ability to move around the level or unlocks more of it to explore. These include:Rope: The rope lets Pac-Man swing across any ceiling, but Pac-Man has to be within a certain range for the rope to attach. It cannot be used horizontally: only vertically.Fireball: Pac's best weapon against the non-ghost enemies. Without it, Pac-Man won't be able to get around enemies without getting hurt, and he can only take so many hits before losing a life.Hammer: The hammer allows Pac-Man to break through certain barriers and open chests.Bubble: The bubble allows Pac-Man to swim through underwater sections, collecting whatever is under the surface. Without it, Pac-Man simply bobs on top of any body of water.In addition, Pac-Man also has to find a way to eliminate ghosts on the stage, as they will continue to hound him until he has been defeated. Ghosts can be eaten whenever Pac-Man finds a Power Pellet, but these are rare and Pac-Man must chase down the now fleeing ghosts before its effects wear off. </div> "

As with most entries in the shooter genre, the story is minimal: players pilot a lone space-faring fighter craft, the eponymous A-144/R ""Phalanx,"" in a one-man assault against a mysterious fleet of alien ""bio-ships"" that have attacked a human colony on planet Delia IV. Along with a unique power-up system, the game also incorporates adjustable ship speeds and a health meter for the player's ship, both of which were uncommon features among shooters at the time.Phalanx was later ported to the Super Famicom and SNES by Kemco in 1992 for the game's first North American and European releases. The SNES version removed most of the anime-style cutscenes present in the X68000 version and featured new music. The SNES release of Phalanx in North America is notable for its unusual box art depicting an elderly banjo player and a distant spaceship streaking across the background, a scene that is never referenced in the game itself. A Game Boy Advance version was ported in 2001, and a downloadable remake of Phalanx based on the original X68000 version was published on the Japanese Wii Shop in 2009. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The first stage in Phalanx's SNES version. The background is comprised of seven layers of parallax scrolling.Phalanx is a side-scrolling space shooter in the vein of Gradius or R-Type. The game features three selectable difficulty levels by default, and a fourth expert level of difficulty called ""Funny"" can be accessed by entering a cheat code at the title screen. The player's ""Phalanx"" fighter craft has the ability to adjust between three different movement speeds, allowing for greater flexibility while evading threats. Unlike most shoot-'em-ups, the player's ship can take up to three hits in the original version of the game before losing a life, and ship health can be replenished by obtaining certain power-ups. Phalanx is also equipped with three weapon slots for upgradable primary weapon power-ups that can be swapped between on-the-fly. If the player obtains a fourth weapon power-up, the weapon in the left slot will be discarded to accommodate the new item. Primary weapon power-ups can be consumed at any time to activate a powerful special attack, and each primary weapon features its own unique special attack. A handful of secondary missile power-ups are fired alongside the ship's primary weapon and do not occupy a weapon slot.Certain gameplay features were altered between Phalanx's releases across different platforms. Secondary missiles have a limited ammo supply in the original X68000 release, whereas all subsequent ports of the game feature unlimited missiles. In order to further reduce the difficulty of the GBA version, the player ship's health was increased to four units instead of three. The ship also features an additional weapons slot on GBA, granting players a total of four weapon slots. </div>  <div> Stages : Energy Compressor (E): Fires energy blasts straight ahead that can be charged to unleash a larger, more powerful projectile. Its special attack, the Anti-Matter Detonator, damages all on-screen enemies for a short time.Homing Beam (H): Fires spheres of light that track enemies. The projectiles' size increases when upgraded. The High Energy Shield special attack creates a damage shield around Phalanx that also grants temporary invincibility.Needle Laser (L): A piercing laser that can pass through solid walls and enemies. The number of bolts increases with upgrades. This weapon also fires backwards once fully-upgraded. When activated, the Spiral Attack causes Phalanx to spin while auto-firing in all directions for several seconds.Reflector (R): Fires projectiles that bounce off of solid walls, making this weapon ideal for confined areas. Its fully-upgraded version also fires backwards. The Stalker Drone special attack creates an autonomous drone that seeks out and destroys enemies one at a time for several seconds.Homing Missiles (A): Secondary missiles that home-in on enemies.Penetrator Missiles (B): Secondary missiles that fire straight ahead and can pass through enemies.Guided Missiles (C): Secondary missiles that mimic the player's movements after being fired.Power Capsule (P): Upgrades the ship's primary weapon by one level and replenishes one unit of health.

The game was developed by SunSoft (SNES) and Illusions Gaming (Genesis) and published by Viacom New Media. Phantom 2040 was released in 1995 in Japan, North America, and Europe.The game is based off of the television series of the same name (itself a spin-off of Lee Falk's classic comic series The Phantom), with a story that is similar to that of the television show's, but not directly taken from it. Phantom 2040 is an action game that takes place in the city of Metropia. The Super Nintendo version holds an average rating of 68% on Game Rankings, while there are no reviews registered for the Genesis version. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Phantom 2040 shares similarities with games such as Super Metroid.The gameplay of Phantom 2040 is similar to many other 2D side-scrolling action games. It contains many aspects similar to such games as Super Metroid and Bionic Commando. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings). Some of these endings, however, aren't considered ""winning"" endings, and rather prompt the player to try again. </div>  <div> Plot : Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.It is the year 2040. The world is in a catastrophic state, due to environmental disasters. The Earth's ecological state hangs in the balance. Growing population and the deployment of robots called BIOTS (Biological Optical Transputer Systems) have caused the majority of people to scavenge for food, while the lucky few live in large, towering mansions.New York City has been renamed Metropia, and is the world's largest and most powerful city. Metropia houses the world's most powerful organization: Maximum, inc.. In addition to being the producer of BIOTS, Maximum holds high political standing due to their bribery of many leaders. Due to this influence, Maximum has transformed Metropia into a technologically-advanced city devoid of any animal or plant life. The insane leader of Maximum, Rebecca Madison, is intent on building a fortress called Cyberville where the wealthy can reside, safe from everything.Kit Walker is a Phantom (the 24th Phantom, in fact). The Phantoms work to restore order to the world, bringing an end to corruption, greed, and the violence that plagues the world.

Players join an amateur flight school and take on a variety of flight-based challenges in order to complete certifications for a series of graded pilot licenses, with the ultimate goal of earning the highest certification and their golden ""pilot wings"". The game heavily showcases the Mode 7 graphical capabilities of the SNES, which are used to simulate three-dimensional spaces without relying on more processing-intensive rendering methods such as polygons.Pilotwings was released within a month of the Super Famicom's November 1990 launch in Japan. It was a launch title for the SNES' North American debut in 1991. </div>  <div> Gameplay : After registering at the ""Flight Club,"" players receive guidance from a number of pilot instructors who present sets of challenges corresponding to each certification grade. Players must earn a minimum number of points in each set of activities in order to progress to the next certification. Points are awarded based on a number of criteria, including accuracy, speed and number of targets reached. In addition to the primary courses, the game also contains a handful of bonus events and two special helicopter missions. </div>  <div> Certifications : Pilotwings features four basic activities that make up the bulk of gameplay: light plane, skydiving, rocketbelt and hang-gliding. The helicopter is only used in two ""Secret Command"" rescue missions.Light Plane: A biplane is used to fly through a series of floating orbs, rings or arches before landing on the flight area's runway. In later Lessons, the biplane begins stationary on the runway, requiring players to take off before completing their objectives.Skydiving: The player is equipped with a steerable parachute and performs a solo jump from a helicopter after climbing to an altitude of 3,800 feet. During their descent, players must use wind resistance to maneuver themselves through a series of rings to earn points. Once the rings are passed, the player can deploy their parachute and attempt to land as close to the center of the target area as possible.Rocketbelt: After strapping on an advanced ""rocketbelt,"" the player jets into the skies to locate and pass through several floating rings or straight beams before landing in the target zone. Wind typically factors heavily into each of the Rocketbelt courses.Hangglider: The hang-glider is towed behind a biplane prior to the beginning of the course. Once released, players are required to ride upward thermal currents to reach a set altitude or pass through one or more floating rings. Landing the glider can be more difficult compared to the other vehicles.Helicopter: Players jump into an attack helicopter during Pilotwings' two ""Secret Command"" missions, each of which involves assaulting a fortified enemy base to rescue one or more VIPs. Pilots must destroy several anti-aircraft gun emplacements scattered around the base before attempting a landing. </div> "

It is also the first fighting game to incorporate real-life actors for the game's characters (through blue-screen digital processing), a technique later becoming popular due to the Mortal Kombat series.Up to three players fight their way through an underground fighting circuit as either ex-pro wrestler Buzz, kickboxer Ty, or karate black belt Kato. Unlike other fighting games of the type, the game focuses primarily on co-operative play (rather than a free-for-all, where only one player can remain standing) similar to other brawlers, as more enemies are fought simultaneously when more players are playing.The game is known for its ports of varying quality throughout 1991 and 1992 for numerous platforms, including the Sega Genesis (the only port with a Japanese release), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published by THQ), Game Boy (also published by THQ), and Atari Lynx. Tengen, Atari Games's home brand, was the publisher for the Genesis version and the developer for the SNES, Game Boy, and Lynx versions. The game was also ported to various computer-based systems in Europe (the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, PC, and ZX Spectrum), all of which were published by Domark.The original arcade version of the game was also included in various Midway compilations for sixth-to-seventh generation consoles, including the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2, the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition, the 2006 Japan-exclusive Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures, and the 2012 Midway Arcade Origins. </div>  <div> Characters : Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato.

He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO. </div> "
Plok,Software Creations,Activision (JP)Tradewest (NA)Nintendo (EU),September 1993,snes,A colorful platformer for the SNES starring a protagonist that can remove his own limbs.,3030-4182,4182,0,1993-09-05,https://www.giantbomb.com/plok/3030-4182/,," <div> Overview : Plok is a side-scrolling action platformer developed by Software Creations (later known as Acclaim Studios Manchester) which was released in 1993 on the SNES. The game is very similar to a lot of the other colorful character-driven platformers of its era, but it distinguished itself with its unique limb-throwing play mechanic and punishing difficulty. </div>  <div> Story : The eponymous Plok.The game opens with Plok, king of the island of Akrillic in the Poly-Esta archipelago, waking up to discover that his Grandpappy’s flag which flew proudly over his home has been stolen. Spotting his flag flying on the nearby Cotton Island, Plok sets sail to retrieve it. Once on Cotton Island, Plok makes his way through a series of decoy flags before finally defeating the Bobbins Brothers and retrieving his family heirloom.Upon his return home, Plok discovers that the theft of his Grandpappy’s flag was simply for the purpose of luring him away from Akrillic so that it would be left defenseless for the Fleas to take over and raise their flags over the land in the place of Plok’s. Determined to reclaim his island, Plok sets out to rid the island of the Fleas and their allies. His quest eventually takes him to the depths of the Flea Pit where he must face off against the Flea Queen in order to determine the fate of Akrillic. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.Plok’s primary ability is that he is able to throw his arms and legs in a boomerang-like manner. This ability can be used both as an attack and to solve certain puzzles which involve Plok giving up a limb in order to activate a switch. With fewer limbs, Plok is less mobile and has less “ammunition” to attack with. Limbs used to activate switches can be retrieved from a hanger somewhere else in the level. Plok is also able to perform a spinning high-jump (very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog’s jumps) which allows him to reach platforms he can’t with his weak standard jump. After receiving an amulet later in the game, the high-jump can also be used as an attack.Plok proceeds from level to level via an overworld screen. The path is linear, but levels can be skipped by using warps throughout the game. Warp zones are accessed by hitting specific berries (usually just used to increase health) until they teleport Plok to the warp area. Once in the warp zone, a “Race Against Time” event will take place which challenges Plok to get some sort of vehicle through a special level and across the finish line in a limited amount of time. If Plok is successful, he’ll be transported ahead to a later level of the game, but if he fails, he’ll be spit back out in the same spot he entered the warp zone.The world of Poly-Esta is filled with many different items and power-ups for Plok to collect. Shells scattered throughout each level will net him an extra life if he can get enough. They can also be used to fuel his special high-jump attack after the amulet item is received later in the game. Additionally, Plok collects the letters P-L-O-K in order to get “Plokontinues” which allow him to continue his journey if he loses all of his lives. Every time Plok defeats a Rockyfella, it will drop a ruby which grants Plok invincibility for a short time. The Razor Wheel pickup will transform Plok into an invincible spinning steel blade that storms through the world with incredible speed. Presents hidden in the world allow Plok to temporarily don one of many costumes that grant him special abilities. </div>  <div> Development History : The character of Plok was originally developed during the late 80’s by brothers John Pickford and Ste Pickford. The character’s introduction to the public was to be as the star of a Zippo Games developed coin-op game titled Fleapit, but unfortunately after the game was about half complete it was put on hold and eventually disappeared with the closing of the studio. The Pickford brothers however managed to retain the intellectual property rights to the basic game and character design. This allowed them to commence with development of another similar title that would eventually become the 1993 title Plok. </div>  <div> Game Reception : When the Pickford brothers were first developing Fleapit (the game that would become Plok) during the late 80’s, the gaming landscape was ripe for an inventive, cute, colorful, character-driven platformer to come along and explode with popularity. However, during the early 90’s the video game market experienced a massive flood of colorful character-driven platform titles such as Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Rayman, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Zool. Thus, by the time Plok was finally released in 1993, it didn’t seem nearly as fresh as it was when development first started nearly five years ago. Reviews for the game were overall very favorable, but commercially the game was received very poorly and sales were underwhelming. There just wasn’t enough to distinguish this game from all of the others that appeared so similar. The game has also at times been criticized because of its difficulty and lack of a save or password system.Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,8,9 and 8 with ""Sushi-X"" exclaiming, ""...Plok has got to be one of the most unique games to come out in a while."" Ed Semrad wrote, ""...while the bosses aren't anything to write home about, the actual game is visually stunning. The challenge level is really high, possibly turning off younger players, but hard-core gamers will love it"". </div> "

Populous,Bullfrog Productions,Acclaim Entertainment,"September 30, 1991",snes,"Commonly cited as the founding title in the god game genre, Populous is a computer game from Bullfrog Productions in which the player is a deity that must help its followers become prosperous enough to overcoming rival deities and their followers.",3030-6210,6210,0,1989-01-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/populous/3030-6210/,," <div> Overview : Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover ArtAside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black & White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of ""retaining the feel"" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit. </div> "

Players can also jump over oil slicks and rough patches on the track. Jumping can also be used to avoid blaster shots, if timed correctly. Typically, each racer only has five blaster rounds available for the entire race. These shots home in on the closest racer and can be fired backwards as well as forwards. </div>  <div> Characters : Zeo Ranger Red: Tommy OliverZeo Ranger Blue: Rocky DeSantosZeo Ranger Green: Adam ParkZeo Ranger Yellow: Tanya SloanZeo Ranger Pink: Kat HillardZeo Ranger Gold: Jason Lee ScottKing MondoCog SoldierCog Ace (Secret Character)Red Ranger and Gold Ranger have well-rounded stats.

Primal Rage,Bitmasters,Time Warner Interactive,"August 25, 1995",snes,Giant beasts from different parts of the post-apocalyptic world fight each other for global domination in this violent 2D fighting game from Atari.,3030-14078,14078,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/primal-rage/3030-14078/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Primal Rage is a 2D kaiju-themed fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994.Players control one of seven giant beasts and must fight to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known as ""Urth""). Like the large bosses in the early Mortal Kombat games (and the dinosaurs of Taito's Dino Rex), all beasts are rendered with stop-motion animation as model figures (while the small human followers are digitized actors). The game features numerous blood effects, including an end-of-round fatality system.Along with major arcade revisions (adding new special moves and abilities), the game received numerous ports for home consoles and handhelds in 1995. Other than the SNES version (which was ported by Bitmasters) and the PC version (which was ported by Teeny Weeny), all ports were done by Probe. They were released in North America and Europe by Time Warner Interactive for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, Game Boy, Game Gear, Jaguar CD (exclusively in North America), 3DO (exclusively in North America), Amiga (exclusively in Europe for ECS and AGA systems), and PC (released for MS-DOS in CD-ROM format). It was also released in Japan for the PS1 (on December 13, 1996 by Time Warner Interactive) and Saturn (on February 26, 1998 by GameBank).Along with a short-lived toyline, it also received a four-issue comic book mini-series years after the game's original release. A sequel named Primal Rage II was in development in 1996, adding a new assortment of giant playable human ""Avatars"" (also rendered from model figures) to fight alongside the beasts. Although this sequel was canceled prior to release, some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) of the sequel have been found, one of which is publically playable. Despite its cancellation, both games received an overarching novelization in 1997 (titled Primal Rage: The Avatars). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Glorified execution moves, known as Fatalities, can also be performed this way at the end of the winning round. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground, giving back some of their vitality. Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final endurance round to keep their place as ""king of the hill"". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish ""dinosaur graveyard"", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, they can immediately restore their character's initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes seven playable beasts (six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions). A final boss beast was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped and turned into an endurance match against the entire roster.Sauron and Blizzard are palette swaps of Diablo and Chaos. However, both Diablo and Chaos are smaller in size. Sauron (God of Hunger) Talon (God of Survival) Vertigo (Goddess of Insanity, unavailable in the GB and GG versions) Blizzard (God of Virtue) Chaos (God of Decay) Armadon (God of Life) Diablo (God of Destruction) </div> "
Prince of Persia,Arsys Software,Masaya (JP)Konami (NA/EU),"November 1, 1992",snes,"A 2008 entry into the Prince of Persia franchise titled simply ""Prince of Persia"", this game stars an all-new Prince as he teams up with the mysterious Elika to fight Ahriman and cleanse the world of his corruption.",3030-20961,20961,0,2008-12-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Prince of Persia for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is the first, all-new Prince of Persia title for ""next-gen"" consoles. Rather than continue the tale of the last trilogy, Ubisoft decided to create a new world with all new characters. Prince of Persia introduces new gameplay elements and a fresh graphical style to the series. Prince of Persia was released on December 2, 2008 in the US.This game was created by Ubisoft Montreal, using the same core team that worked on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. This game is not a continuation of the Sands of Time trilogy, but rather the start of a new trilogy with a new Prince and a new world. The game runs on a updated version of the Scimitar Engine created for Assassin's Creed, which allows the game to be non-linear, yet still allow the Prince to traverse the land with his usual acrobatic prowess. </div>  <div> Story : The Prince and ElikaThe adventure begins with a new Prince of Persia, a wanderer, who is returning home from an adventure on a donkey named Farah with a king's treasure in gold, which he earned on his previous venture. Not yet the Prince to be, he desires nothing more then to spend his treasure on many luxuries, including women and liquor, and carpets very thick.However quite suddenly, he is caught in a fierce sandstorm and is blown away. When the sandstorm subsides, he finds himself in a mythical garden of beauty, dominated at its center by a massive Tree of Life. The Prince and a girl, Elika, find each other, and, in the same predicament, decide to help each other. Together, they venture to the center of this grand oasis. When they arrive at the center, they witness the destruction of the tree, and the freedom of Ahriman, the ancient god of darkness. After being set free, Ahriman starts destroying the Tree of Light and the land is full with darkness and evil. The Prince, with the aid of Elika and her new found magic, take up arms against Ahriman's corruption, in an attempt to drive it back and cleanse the world with light once again.With Elika's help the Prince travels to the four different locations: the Citadel, the City of Light, the Royal Palace, and the Vale to vanquish each of the four bosses. Once each boss is defeated the duo travel back to the temple to make sure Ahriman is sealed in the Tree of Light. When they get there they are confronted by Elika's father, the King, who attempts to stop them one last time. Upon defeat the King leaps into an abyss towards the Tree of Light. A second later Ahriman rises up in the form of a dragon monster and tries to kill the Prince and Elika. From the viewpoint of Ahriman you must travel around the room and heal the remaining areas surrounding the Tree. Once this is done Ahriman is captured back in the Tree, and Elika collapses. The Prince realizes that Elika has died, he understands now that Elika is giving bits of her life to heal all of the lands throughout the game. He now realizes that Elika's father only realized Ahriman so that Elika could live, it seems one cannot live without the other. The Prince lays her down outside the temple and travels back to the beginning of each area. In front of each of the four area's is a tree similar to the Tree of Light. The prince cuts down all four trees and travels back to the Tree of Light in the temple.One final blow and he cuts down the tree of light that you worked so hard to restore throughout the game, releasing Ahriman back into the world as the King had previously done. The Prince carries the huge ball of light to where Elika is at the front of the temple and places it over her. Elika then comes back to life. The final scene shows the prince walking away from the temple with Elika in his arms, as Ahriman in his full demon form flies overhead and out of the scene, released into the world once more. The final trophy/achievement for the game is awarded at this point, it is titled ""To Be Continued."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Healing the lands with light again.The Prince is able to traverse the land, with what has now become the standard arsenal of moves for him. He is able to wall-run, leap from wall to wall, swing on poles, and of course jump and hang from ledges.New to this game however are the inclusion of the Prince's claws called the Gauntlet, which are a sort of glove he wears on his left hand which can smash into walls and save him from falling, though neither battle wounds nor falling end up in Prince's death due to help of his companion Elika, who will save him whenever he is in danger. By using the Gauntlet he is able to slide down walls and even block attacks. The game also features a healthy smattering of environmental puzzles which the Prince can solve with help from his new friend Elika who aids him on his adventure, both in combat and adventure.Unlike other titles, the Prince will not collect new equipment to aid him in his journey. There is no special armor or gauntlet to collect in the game. The sword the Prince begins with is the one which he wields until the end, in an effort to make it a memorable weapon. Players will, however, gain new magical powers which Elika will use. Once the player has collected enough Light Seeds, they can be traded in at the temple for the player's ability of choice. These light seeds appear throughout every level once it has been cleansed, and many are challenging to obtain. The abilities which can be unlocked will allow the player to access new areas once inaccessible, as well as grab light seeds once unobtainable.The Hunter attacking the Prince and Elika.In the previous trilogy of games, the Prince utilized the Sands of Time in order to rewind time and fix any mistakes he had made. In this Prince of Persia, there are no Sands of Time, rather, Elika will help the Prince to jump higher and farther. Elika proves to be an excellent help throughout the game, and has been designed to help rather then hinder the Prince's success.Prince of Persia contains light puzzle elements, with one or two puzzles in each of the game's zones. The puzzles involve lever pulling, whether to put walls in place, or open floodgates. The puzzles are meant to add variety to the game which is heavy on platforming.Combat has also been changed, with a focus on one-on-two: the Prince and Elika versus an enemy. Elika is able to perform combos seamlessly with the Prince. The design philosophy driving the new combat system is to make each battle both more intense and cinematic. Fights are not as common as they were in the previous games, but aim to keep the player on the edge of their seat using intense, cinematic imagery.In tradition of the other Prince of Persia's, the game has great acrobatics.The combat system assigns attacks to four main buttons. Elika, the Prince's sword, and the gauntlet are all assigned to their own button, as well as one button reserved for 'acrobatic' attacks. The player can initiate a combo with any of the four choices, then continue with another. Both timing and attack selection are key to creating larger combos. If the player hesitates, they miss the opportunity to attack. Visual cues in the on screen action will make the player aware of the attack they should next perform on some occasions, and any other attempts will end the combo. These are usually reserved for combo finishers, however, as the first few choices are generally up to the player.The Prince can also block attacks and counter blows. Holding the block button will guard most attacks, but pressing it strategically will create an opportunity to counter. The player must beware, however, as enemies can also counter. The combat system also employs quick time events at various times throughout a battle. The player will need to repeatedly press buttons to push the enemy away or quickly press a prompted button to avoid a final blow. Throughout the game, the player will encounter a variety of enemies which require creative thinking to take down, such as The Warrior, who cannot be harmed by the sword, gauntlet, or magic. </div>  <div> Development : Prince of Persia's development team began conception right as Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released, however, tangible proof of the game was found when, on September 21, 2006 a leaked concept art hit the net. Ubisoft remained silent and made no comment. On January 23, 2008 some more screen shots from the game were leaked onto the internet, while the game was in it's conception phase. Once again, Ubisoft did not comment.In May 2008, Ubisoft finally released two videos of a concept artist designing the Prince and Elika confirming the existence of the game officially under the Prince of Persia title. One video shows a full-bodied new Prince being speed drawn using Photoshop. The other art drawing video detailed Elika and finally the third speed concept art emerged in July, 2008, this time depicting a prime enemy; The Hunter. Those videos may be seen here and here. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The Shapeshifter, relaxing at home.The Prince of Persia Epilogue content appeared the PS3 and Xbox 360 on February 26. It continues the story of the retail game, increases the difficulty, adds a new power for Elika and attack for the Prince, reveals a brand new location, and includes two unlockable skins that become available after completing the Epilogue.Jamal Rguigui has said that the Ubisoft Montreal team decided to go on ahead full throttle with some cool ideas that the team had during and post-production and developed a unique DLC that would enhance the experience for Prince of Persia fans. It was not content that was cut, but was content that was further polished and elaborated on. He continued to say that they had a lot of ambitions for the DLC and that they were filtering all the feedback from the industry and the community of gamers. Players can expect to have a specific experience that will give them more content with superior difficulty and pace. This is one of the most ambitious DLC projects from Ubisoft, and it adds to the understanding of Prince of Persia's new world and characters.New powers away!Elika will be receiving a new power that is called Energize which is a travel based power that adds a timing challenge. This power allows Elika, for a short period of time, to materialize an area of the environment that was previously destroyed. Therefore, the Prince and Elika will be able to access areas previously impossible to reach without this power. There is also a new enemy in the form of the Shapeshifter which is an enemy that takes the form of two of Ahriman's most fearsome Lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter. Though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player, it will requires a particular strategy to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the Epilogue. As mentioned the content will also include a feature called sprint clashing. When the Prince and the enemy are at a distance, the player can mash the acrobatics button, which will allow the enemy and the Prince to sprint at each other and attack. The new area is called the Underground Palace and it is completely corrupted. Ubisoft has listened to the feedback and upped the pace of the game with more aggressive A.I and more complex traps. The content will also have new Trophies and Achievements.It is not necessary to have finished the Prince of Persia game to play the DLC. This content is available both Xbox 360 and PS3 on March 5 for 800 MS points and $10 respectively. </div>  <div> Areas : Prince of Persia is divided into four different areas, each of which has its own visual style. Each zone is divided into six areas: one introductory area, four main Fertile Ground areas, and one final area behind a black gate.To reach the final area, the player must first heal all fertile grounds in the zone. Players can progress through each area as they choose, but are limited to the power they posses. Initially, all introductory fertile grounds must be healed to progress. Once the player chooses a power, however, they can choose which power they want, and Elika will inform the player which areas are accessible with each power. Each power will open up four areas in two zones each. The Prince can freely travel between each level with no load times as each is connected.The areas are as follows: </div>  <div> Bosses : The Hunter, who stalks his prey in The CitadelThe long abandoned guard post of the city, the Citadel is currently where The Hunter resides. </div>  <div> Music : The Warrior, who rules over the City of LightThe City of Light was once a place of wonders, but once it came into The Warrior's hands, it is now a place of destruction. The city was once a place where travellers would come to trade, scholars would gather to learn, and filled with beauty and life. </div>  <div> Limited Edition Offer : The Concubine, who resides in the Royal PalaceIn the Royal Palace, The Prince will encounter The Concubine. The Royal Palace contains a cavern, the Royal Gardens, the Royal Spire, the Spire of Dreams, the Coronation Chamber, and the Palace rooms. The Royal Palace is an area which holds many memories for Elika, and many important areas for the kingdom. The Royal Spire serves as the seat of power in the land, and was where Elika's father sat on his throne, and the hall of coronation, where the king receives his crown. The king and queen were wed in the Spire of Dreams, a place that was said to make one's dreams come true. Once upon a time, the Royal Palace was a place of wonder. Actors filled the cavern, and the lush gardens were truly a sight to behold. After Elika's mother died, the Royal Palace began to lose beauty. The gardens withered away along with the king's sanity, and the Royal Palace is now merely a fraction of its former glory. </div>  <div> Alternate Skins : The Alchemist, who resides in The ValeThe Alchemist claims the Vale as his home, dwelling within the Observatory, where he brings terror to The Vale. The Vale is characterized by many different, wondrous machines, which the Alchemist invented when Ahriman was free. </div>  <div> Penny Arcade Story Book : The HunterThe Hunter was once a prince, who lived only for the hunt. He would travel lands, far and wide in an attempt to face off against the most exotic and powerful beasts. After a certain amount of time had passed, and a certain amount of animals had been slain, the Hunter felt that there was no longer any creature alive that would give him the thrill of the chase. This is when Ahriman's voice crept in and offered him a solution to his dilemma. The Hunter was to offer his soul to Ahriman, and in exchange would be allowed to hunt for all eternity, the one creature that could pose any sort of challenge: man. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The Concubine used to be a beautiful women, who had the ability to trick any man she wanted into doing whatever she desired. She used her beauty and gift and became political. One day however she fell in love with a handsome noble man, and they were to be married. However a jealous women, came and attacked her, disfiguring her, and her face. With no way to return to her former beauty, the Concubine fled, and sold her soul to Ahriman, and exchange, she would have the ability to control all men. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The WarriorOnce a King of a great nation, the Warrior was forced into becoming a corrupted being. His kingdom was facing great problems and were constantly at war, and so Ahriman came to the Warrior and offered him great power in exchange for his soul and servitude. To protect his people, the Warrior accepted, and he was suddenly transformed into a great and powerful being. However when his enemies were defeated his people were scared and shunned him, and he realized that he had become the very thing he had fought. Thus, to protect his people and fulfil his duty, he left and became a warrior at Ahriman's side. </div> "

The gist of the story is that the Quavers mascot, a character named Colin Curly, has lost his packets of Quavers down an ant hill. The SNES version saw Colin Curly being changed to Captain Rat and the Quavers replaced by bundles of cash. The game was originally designed before the Quavers brand was tacked on, and received some good reviews. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player controls an ant called G.I. Ant, who has to return Colin's favorite snack by pushing over a number of dominoes. The object is to knock over a key domino that will open up a door to the next level. This is done by picking up and move dominoes around the screen, arranging them, and utilizing their special abilities (see below). The player is only able to push one domino, so the sequence must be planned out in advance.There are many ways in which levels can be made unwinnable; for one thing, there is a time limit for each of the 100 levels and if this runs out the player is able to continue with the level but is unable to move onto the next. All the dominoes must also be knocked over to complete the level, and G.I. Ant must be able to get to the exit door. G.I. Ant himself can also die, either by falling from a great height, falling through the gaps at the bottom of the screen or the death from above i.e. a domino falling on top of him.There are 9 different themes that the levels are based on: a castle, a dungeon, an Aztec temple, the inside of a PC, a space station, a factory/industrial theme, a Meccano based world, a Japanese house, and a Greek building. After every 10 levels, there is a cutscene of G.I. Ant handing a very grateful Colin his bag of Quavers. </div> "

Though the SNES version suffers due to supervision by notorious developers-for-hire Micronics, the Genesis version is acceptably close to the original source material despite a few necessary drops in sound and visual quality. The FM Towns version is thought to have the best fidelity of all the versions of Raiden Trad, but like the console itself was never released outside of Japan. The Jaguar version was also well regarded at the time, and a Lynx version was all but cancelled during production.There would be one more conversion of Raiden in the 90s: The Raiden Project, a launch title for the PS1. This is thought to be the superlative home version of the game. </div> "

Created by Atari for the arcade, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk. </div>  <div> Cultural Impact : The current world record score for Rampart is 41,180, achieved by Mark Boolman in Bloomington, Illinois under referee verification on March 28th 2008. </div> "

The player, as Ranma, must locate the titular gang in order to recover his father Genma, who spends most of the game in his panda form.Ranma ends up recruiting various friends, fiances and recurring foes into his group to take down the interloping organization. Almost every character has a ""cursed form"", many of which change the abilties at the character's disposal. Ranma, for instance, changes into a female version of himself when doused with cold water but suffers no adverse effects from this transformation as far as combat goes. Others transform into weaker or stronger creatures.Akanekodan-teki Hihou is the third Ranma 1/2 game for the Super Famicom and the first to not receive a US localization. It is also the first game that didn't belong to the fighter genre.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ranma 1/2: Akanekodan-teki Hihou is a traditional turn-based RPG. Each character fights using their martial arts, taking turns based on a speed stat. While wandering around town looking for clues behind the Red Cat Gang, the player encounters enemies to fight.The player can recruit the following characters:Ranma Saotome: Ranma is the permanent leader of the group and is a good all-round fighter with an emphasis on powerful attacks. His female form, Ranma-chan, has identical stats.Akane Tendo: Ranma's fiancée (one of them, at least) and another moderately strong fighter with healing abilities. She's also a semi-permanent member and joins the party from the offset. She doesn't have a cursed form.Shampoo: Another of Ranma's fiancées. She has lower stats but much higher speed which, in combination with her healing abilities, makes her a useful support unit. She transforms into a cat, but suffers no ill effects in combat.Ryoga Hibiki: Ranma's self-described rival, though Ranma considers him unworthy. In-game, Ryoga is a powerhouse who usually ends up as the party's muscle. His cursed form, a tiny black pig called P-Chan, prohibits him from using most of his techniques.Genma Saotome: Ranma's lackadaisical father, who usually spends his time in his cursed form as a panda bear. Though he has tank-like stats, his techniques are generally less effective. This is in reference to the joke side of his character, as he was quickly surpassed by his own child during Ranma's training.Mousse: Another of Ranma's rivals, who suffers terrible eyesight problems despite his martial prowess. His cursed form is that of a duck, who can only use a handful of techniques. </div> "

It is the only game in the series that was properly localized for a worldwide release (not including the massively-reskinned Street Combat), with translations by Viz Media (who distributed the manga/anime series at the time). </div>  <div> Characters : Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle features ten fighters (technically twelve, as two characters can fight in two separate forms) as well as an unplayable boss character. In the single player, each fighter is taking part in a tournament due to a promise or a suggestion made by Principal Kuno, though most of them have been coerced or tricked into competing.Ranma Saotome - Ranma is the protagonist of the series and, like many Ranma characters, has a ""cursed"" form due to falling into a cursed spring while training. This cursed form is a female version of himself, who is slightly faster but also physically weaker - their movesets are otherwise identical. The player can choose to fight as either form. Because he's let his studies fall to the wayside to focus on his fighting, he takes part in the tournament for the promise of being given top grades.Genma Saotome - Genma is Ranma's father and taught him martial arts, though Ranma quickly surpassed him in skill. Genma's cursed form is that of a giant panda, and this is the only form that is playable. Genma competes in the tournament to knock some sense into his rebellious son.Ryoga Hibiki - Ryoga is Ranma's self-proclaimed rival and has a similar moveset. His cursed form is that of a tiny adorable black piglet with zero fighting ability. Ryoga wakes up in the Principal's office with amnesia and is fighting in order to get his memory back.Akane Tendo - Scion of the powerful Tendo dojo and semi-reluctant arranged fiancée of Ranma, Akane enters the tournament to deter her many admirers from constantly bothering her.Shampoo - Another of Ranma's fiancées, Shampoo enters the tournament hoping to impress him with her fighting prowess. Her cursed form is that of a cat, an animal Ranma is phobic towards. She's the fastest character in the game and can even double jump.Hikaru Gosunkugi - A student obsessed with voodoo and the occult who has a crush on Akane. He fights to win her over. He uses occult items like a straw voodoo doll in combat.Ukyo Kuonji - Another of Ranma's brides-to-be and a dedicated okonomiyaki chef, she is convinced to enter the tournament in order to prove her strength as a fighter and businesswoman. She fights with spatulas.Gambling King - A nefarious figure who looks like one of the kings from a deck of playing cards, he enters the tournament to make enough money to build his very own casino. He's one of the slowest and weakest characters, and thus the most challenging to beat the game with.Mousse - Shampoo's childhood friend. His love for her is unrequited and he blames (male) Ranma for catching her eye. He is tricked into fighting in the tournament by the Principal in a fortune teller disguise, who tells him that his happiness is dependent on winning the contest. Despite being nearly blind, he is an adept fighter who flings hidden objects at his opponents.Pantyhose Taro - The unfortunately-named Pantyhose is an antagonist of the series and serves as the final boss for most of the game's characters. His cursed form is that of a mighty chimera or demon, and characters either end up fighting him in his human or his monstrous form. He is unlocked as a playable character for story mode once beaten, though he can be played in Versus mode from the offset.Happosai - Happosai is a very small but indescribably powerful martial artist as well as a perverted old man. Pantyhose must defeat him as the boss of his story mode in order to receive a new name. He is unplayable. </div> "

It also hyped a dedicated soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May of Queen fame, though it was instead done in-house, with parts of some tracks from Brian May's previous album Back to the Light included. Upon release, the game failed to live up to expectations and was widely panned due to its weak gameplay mechanics, controls, and aesthetics. Along with a novelization, the game also received a not-as-hyped sequel in 1996, titled Rise 2: Resurrection.It was ported to popular consoles at the time by Data Design Interactive., including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published in December 1994 by T&E Soft in Japan and Acclaim elsewhere), Game Gear (published by Time Warner in 1995), and Sega Mega Drive (published exclusively in Europe in 1995 by Acclaim).

Due to its organic components, it is immune from the EGO virus and is thus used by Electrocorp to quell the robot uprising.The game's novelization further builds on Cyborg's backstory, with the organic components of the cyborg ""Coton"" cloned from of the CEO of Electrocorp, who he thought of as a father and swore vengeance to once the rebelling robots murdered him.It is the only playable character in single-player mode and is always in the Player One slot in the Versus mode (with the exception of the Military mirror-match cheat code).Special Moves:Turbo Head Butt (D, U + attack) - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Barge (B, F + attack) - A short range charge attack, useful for getting out of corners. </div>  <div> Story : The primitive Loader Droid is a simple all-purpose utility robot whose primary duty was to lift and carry heavy objects with its heavy retractable forked arms.

The game manual builds on this by having Jack's girlfriend Heather kidnapped.The Japanese version follows detective Rick Norton and sergeant Douglas Bild, both of the Neo-Cisco police force, as they work to rescue Rick's journalist sister Maria from a mysterious criminal syndicate (which is also spreading a new type of mysterious drug she was investigating). This version includes additional cutscenes detailing the game's plot.Along with its two-player multiplayer, which was notable for the time as the SNES version of Final Fight only included single-player, Rival Turf is known for its unique scoring system (which accumulates based on enemies defeated and depletes based on Special Attacks used) and its signature ""Angry Mode"": a temporary buff given to the player after they receive a lot of damage in a short amount of time.The game later received two sequels: Brawl Brothers and The Peace Keepers. It also received a digital re-release as a Virtual Console title, first for the Wii in 2010-2011, then for the Wii U in 2015. It was later included in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online service on May 27, 2022. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays similarly to other belt-scrolling beat-'em-ups of the time, including Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Along with moving their character, players have access to a Jump button (defaulted to B), a Normal Attack button (defaulted to Y), a Special Attack button (defaulted to A), and a Run button (defaulted to L and R).The Normal Attack button is used for standard attack chains, jumping attacks, dashing attacks, and throwing attacks. Each of the two characters also has a limited-use Special Attack (""Sweep Hurricane"" for Flak/Norton and ""Storm Bomber"" for Nelson/Bild) that is activated by the dedicated Special Attack button. Rather than depleting the character's health or a unique meter like in similar games, Special Attacks deplete part of the player's Score (which accumulate 1 point for each enemy defeated and deplete 5 points for each Special Attack used).

Robotrek,Quintet,Enix,"October 1, 1994",snes,"An action RPG that lets the player build and upgrade robots to do battle against foes! Oh, and there's an Einstein lookalike. ",3030-394,394,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/robotrek/3030-394/,," <div> Overview : Robotrek is a role-playing game that was released on October 1, 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Developed by Quintet and Ancient, and published by Enix, Robotrek was fairly well-received, garnering mid-to-high scores from the majority of publications. The game follows a young, unnamed inventor in his quest for knowledge, as well as rescuing his father from a mysterious organization known as the Hackers. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Robotrek's battle system is a mixture of Pokémon and Final Fantasy.The gameplay in Robotrek is centered around the ability to create, customize, and battle robots. The unnamed player character is first presented with the option to build a robot in the hometown of Rococo, with each additional robot (up to three) costing a set amount more than the previous robot. These robots are built and customized in R&D stations scattered around the game world. Robots can also be customized upon leveling up, but creation can only occur at R&D stations.Upon creation, robots are allotted a certain amount of energy points, which can be freely distributed into five stats: health, strength, defense, charge (the speed at which attacking ability is recharged), and speed. Even after allotting these points, they can be freely moved at any time, and subsequently distributed into another statistic. Additionally, robots' color is also customizable, with sliders for red, green, and blue (and any mixture therein).The last part of customizability involves ""programming"" special attacks that the robots can unleash during battle. Every special attack in the game is available from the outset, the player merely has to know the combination of buttons to program it. In order to program a move, the player inputs the right trigger, left trigger, and X button in a particular order. For example, the right trigger three times will be a triple sword hit.R&D Stations are where players can create and customize robots.The battle system is somewhat similar to the Active Time Battle system used in many Final Fantasy games. Battles take place on a three plane field, where the player and enemies can move up and down into each row. After activating a battle, there are two time-based actions that occur. The player is given a time limit, and if this limit is met then extra experience is awarded. Secondly, there are treasure chests scattered in the battle field, which, when broken by specific weapons, award items.Each weapon (up to three can be equipped simultaneously) is mapped to a separate button. The left trigger controls a long range weapon (typically a shot or laser), the right trigger controls the melee weapon (typically a sword, blade, axe, etc.), and the X button controls the bomb (if equipped, as stat boosting packs can be equipped here instead). Robots are also able to Run programs, use items, change which robot is active, or escape the battle. Each action takes a certain amount of energy, and as energy is recharging, enemies are able to attack. The speed at which energy recharges is controlled by the charge stat.The overworld map system is akin to Super Mario Bros. 3.The overworld is separated into two different parts; the main overworld, which is akin to the level selection from Super Mario Bros. 3, and then more specific areas such as towns or caves (each dot on the map leads to an area). In the more specific areas, the player is able to use key items, typically for a story driven purpose (such as a drill which can destroy rocks in caves, or glasses which allow the player to see invisible enemies and traps).Books are an integral part of learning new building parts. The player is able to craft and combine items within the R&D stations. Many ""crafting recipes"" are gained from reading books, known in the context of the game as ""Inventor's Friends."" Each book has a level requirement, and some can even be missed entirely. Crafting items does cost money, whereas combining items does not. Combining items can also be used to level up weapons. For example, combining two Sword 4s will result in a Sword 4 at level 2. These levels go up to nine. </div>  <div> Plot : Robotrek follows an unnamed protagonist on his quest to become a more skilled inventor. The game begins with the boy's father, Akihabara, giving him The Robot Book. After exploring for some brief time, and building the first robot, the game's plot is set up. Upon returning to the main town, Rococo, all of the children have gone missing. They have, apparently, gone to search for the base of a mysterious and malevolent group known as ""The Hackers.""The Forest of Illusion houses a mysterious mansion.Upon reaching the base of the Hackers, all of the children are saved. Exploring deeper into the base, the player finds Kotetsu, an amateur thief, who has also been captured by the Hackers. Fighting even deeper, the boss of this particular base is Meta Crab, who was transformed into a giant crab in order to search the cave for a mysterious element known as Tetron, supposedly hidden within the cave.The player discovers that there are three pieces of Tetron hidden in the world of Quintenix. Collecting all three will grant the person ultimate power. The player tracks one down to a mansion in the Forest of Illusion. Here, the player meets Mint, a reporter who appears sporadically throughout the remainder of the game.The third piece of Tetron is tracked down to an island to the south. Specifically, the volcano on the aforementioned island. A Hacker base is stationed inside of the volcano, led by Dr. Einst, a previously friendly non-playable character who is enslaving the people of Rococo and transforming those who disobey him into mice. After finally defeating Dr. Einst, the player meets Napoleon, a mysterious robot from another planet who helps the player escape from the base.Napoleon and the player confront Gateau.After a Hacker steals all three pieces of Tetron from the player, it is decided that it is time to both rescue Akihabara from his imprisonment and to recover the stolen Tetron. The Hacker Base is located in Snow Mountain, where the player manages to successfully rescue Akihabara. However, the base suddenly explodes, and the player is launched into the past.In the past, the player finds Napoleon's ship. It is revealed that he actually came from another planet (the planet of Choco), along with Cookie, Rask, and Gateau. Gateau is revealed to be a traitor, and ends up escaping along with the Tetron. This is when the player wakes up, revealing that this blast from the past was actually a dream.Back in the present, the player is contacted by Tira, a princess from the planet Choco. Hackers are attacking the planet, and the player is needed to help fight back. Gateau is here as well, but he is feigning amnesia. He kidnaps the princess and takes all of the Tetron, and leaves to the space fortress of the Hackers. After a lengthy exploration of the fortress, the player finds Gateau and fights him in the final battle, reconciling all of the damage caused by the Tetron. </div>  <div> Trivia : The original Japanese title for this game was Slap Stick. As its name and many of the characters names in the game imply, it was meant to be silly and to parody common tropes in RPGs of the time.The sales of this game in America leveled out at around 20,000. The developers, Quintet, mentioned at the time that the name being so similar to the popular anime ""Robotech"" was probably a bad localization choice. </div> "

Up to two players can play together while the rest is AI controlled. The game is viewed from an isometric view.Although the title indicates that this is a racing game, there is a major emphasis on attacking competitors with many different weapons (rockets, mines, etc.) Although players re-spawn rather quickly, the cash bonus handed out for kills is always a good reason to fire that last rocket. Tracks are littered with various pickups such as oil slicks, mines, and health and money packs. Sometimes, depending on the planet the race is being hosted on, various obstacles like lava or snow, can appear.Commentary is given by Loudmouth Larry (voiced by Larry ""Supermouth"" Huffman,) who chimes in throughout the race at key moments:The stage is set, the green flag drops!Let the carnage begin!Rip is about to blow!Hawk should avoid mines!Olaf lights him up!Holy Toledo!Olaf Unleashes Hot Fury!Between the races, players can spend their hard earned money on outfitting their cars with more weapon charges, better parts (like improved bumpers or tires), or just buy a new car. The races always last for four laps and a nice cash and point reward is split between first, second, and third place.

It is somewhat inspired by the success of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, and features a rodent protagonist who is able to sprint at great speeds during certain sections of the game. However, most of the game's level design is engineered around Rocky's constantly changing hairstyle - each style has a different attack or ability associated with it, and these abilities are usually required to progress further through the game. </div>  <div> Story : Rocky's on the run once again for stealing food when he bumps in to the owner of the restaurant from which he just skipped out on. The owner beseeches Rocky: the mob has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. If Rocky can save her and thrash the mafia goons that are tightening their grip on the city, Rocky will be able to eat all he wants at his restaurant for life. Not one to pass up a meal ticket, Rocky agrees and sets off on his quest across the vast metropolis to retrieve the restaurant owner's daughter. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Things get hairy! Rocky Rodent is a standard mascot platformer. By holding down the run button, Rocky picks up a considerable amount of speed - something that comes in handy in later ""chase"" stages. But what primarily sets Rocky Rodent apart from the pack are his power-ups - there's no Mushrooms,  Tiki Masks or  breakable TVs to be found in the world of Rocky Rodent. Rocky's power-ups come out of trashcans, and in the form of special hair styles. There are several hair styles in the game, each with their own unique functions:Hairspray: Styles Rocky's hair in to a giant pink spike, which can be used like a rhino horn to skewer enemies and break cracked ceiling blocks. By jumping in to certain ceiling types, Rocky can stick in to the ceiling and use it to flip around to the floor above.Electric Shaver: Gives Rocky a literal ""buzz cut"" - an axe-like mohawk that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang. Can be used to cut things. Rocky can embed it into walls and jump off them as well.Flower Pot: This gives Rocky a braided ponytail that allows him to latch onto and swing across any hooks in the level.Bird's Nest: This unkempt haircut includes a flashing egg, which will eventually hatch if Rocky manages to avoid taking damage. Once hatched, a helpful companion named Pecky will chase after and defeat regular enemies. Pecky will not chase after or damage bosses, however.Salon Dryer: A large machine that changes Rocky's hair into a coiled spring. By bouncing on his head with this hairstyle, Rocky's vertical leap is greatly enhanced.In addition to being stylish, Rocky's hairdos also protect him from one additional hit of damage. If Rocky takes damage without a hair style, he will die. </div> "

Saturday Night Slam Masters,Capcom,Capcom,June 1994,snes,"Capcom's main entry into pro-wrestling video games, Saturday Night Slam Masters blends a colorful cast of fictional characters with unique mechanics based on fighting games.",3030-16684,16684,0,1993-07-13,https://www.giantbomb.com/saturday-night-slam-masters/3030-16684/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Most of the promotional artwork is from the artist who drew the popular Fist of the North Star manga.Saturday Night Slam Masters (known in Japan as Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion) is a 2D belt-scrolling wrestling game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (running enhanced CPS-1 hardware) on July 13, 1993.Capcom's entry into the professional wrestling genre pits ten wrestlers in a worldwide tournament of the fictional Capcom Wrestling Federation (CWF), including Mike Haggar from the Final Fight series. The game is known for its use of fighting game mechanics (including the ability to jump and the ability to perform special moves).The game includes two game modes chosen from the start: Single Match mode (which uses traditional one-on-one matches) and Team Battle Royale mode (which uses two-on-two tornado-tag matches, where all wrestlers fight simultaneously). Arcade cabinets that support four players (or two linked-up two-player cabinets) can play four-player Team Battle Royale matches.Saturday Night Slam Masters was ported to the FM Towns Marty (in Japan only) on November 1993, and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis throughout 1994. While the SNES version was the only version to include Team Battle Royale mode (which can be played in four-player thanks to multitap accessories), the Genesis version includes an exclusive Death Match mode, which grants more weapons to use, covers the ropes with barbed wire and proximity explosives (making it impossible to bounce off the ropes, but allows players to damage their opponents by throwing them at the ropes), and lays land mines outside the arena.An updated version of the arcade release (titled Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle in the international version and Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors in the Japanese version) was released on December 1993, removing Single Match mode entirely while refining the grappling mechanics, adding new moves for all characters, and allowing players to select the same character. On September 2, 1994, the game received a sequel, titled Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II, which refined it to a traditional fighting game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game controls not unlike a simplified Capcom 2D fighting game, including a single button for attacks, a jump button and a grapple button. Wrestlers can also run against the ropes of the ring, creating a new set of running attacks. Each wrestler featured has one unique special move as well as a finisher they can perform from the grapple once they had depleted their opponents health bar low enough. Once the opponent's health bar is either completely empty, or close to empty, the wrestler can attempt a pin to win or use a submission move to make their opponent quit. Matches can also end with a 20-count ring out.The game features two play modes: Single Match, which featured traditional one-on-one wrestling matches, and Team Battle Royale, which featured two-on-two elimination style matches. In Team Battle Royale, both members of a team have to be pinned or submit for the other team to win. Players could either form a cooperative team, or a single player could have a CPU controlled partner. If playing Team Battle Royale in single player, the match ends in a ""No Contest"" if the player character is pinned and his CPU controlled partner is not.The game also features the ability to leave the ring. Various weapons can be found that allow a wrestler to greatly damage their opponent. The game features no disqualifications for using weapons. </div>  <div> Characters : CharacterBioAlexander ""The Grater""Alexander ""The Grater"" (known in the Japanese version as Sheep the Royal) is an American wrestler (Australian in the Japanese version) and butcher (from Kentucky, U.S.A.).He is based on the real life wrestler Big Van Vader.Biff SlamkovichBiff Slamkovich (known in the Japanese version as Aleksey Zalazof) is a Russian wrestler (from Kiev, Ukraine) and the main protagonist of the series.Also known as ""The Rocking Ruskie"", he is an apprentice of Mike Haggar, and considers fellow apprentice Gunloc as his rival.

Acclaim published both versions, though they have separate developers. Both versions of the game are based on the Scooby Doo TV franchise.The Sega Genesis version of the game is a ""point-and-click"" in the vein of a LucasArts or Sierra graphic adventure game. It features two episodes where Scooby and Shaggy are on their own to solve the mysteries solo. The player controls Shaggy while Scooby accompanies him everywhere that he goes. Scooby will sometimes give the player hints by pointing at objects they may need, or places of interest. The player searches through each location to find items and clues that will help them solve each mystery.The Super Nintendo version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling action game based around searching through different locales for clues to solve the mystery. The player controls Scooby and Shaggy, who can search different rooms for various items, and sniff out hidden ones. Shaggy can speak to members of the gang to accomplish different goals.Daphne provides the duo with Scooby Snacks to decrease Shaggy and Scooby's ""fright meter"", which operates similar to a combined health and sanity meter.Fred provides the blueprints to construct the traps to catch the villain.Velma can determine if an item the duo found is a clue, and award the player 200 points for every clue item recovered. She will eventually piece together the mystery with enough clues.The SNES version has recurring enemies, some of which can be leaped over while others - like the ""ghost pirates"" - need special items to temporarily eliminate them. Shaggy can only carry three items at once, and this includes trap items and Scooby Snacks. The player must be careful to save a space for new clue items when they find them. </div>  <div> Plot : Each episode involves the gang driving to a reportedly haunted locale and trying to figure out what, or who, is behind all the ruckus.

It is notable for being soundtrack composer Jeremy Soule's first video game. It is also the first and so far only game developed by Square designers in North America. After lackluster sales and reviews, the team was dissolved and spread out to many other developers such as EA, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft Game Studios. </div>  <div> Plot : The machine that sends the boy and his dog to the world of Evermore.The game begins in 1965 in the fictional American small town named Podunk, where a scientist named Professor Ruffleberg created the world of Evermore, a utopia which could be manifested in any way its inhabitants saw fit. During its unveiling at a party, however, something went wrong and trapped all of the party's guests in Evermore with no way of escape.Thirty years later, a young boy and his pet dog are on their way home from the cinema when the dog decides to chase a cat. The boy follows him into the Professor's abandoned mansion, where they accidentally activate a machine that sends them to the world of Evermore. They soon discover that things in Evermore aren't working as they're supposed to, so they must set out across the world to meet its inhabitants and find their way home.Each of the original inhabitants has a world designed to their liking. Depending on the realm the player is currently in, the dog transforms into a creature more suitable to his surroundings, making him faster, stronger and a great companion in combat. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Secret of Evermore is a top-down action RPG. The player controls the boy and the dog as they travel around Evermore fighting monsters, casting spells and talking to non-player characters. The majority of the gameplay elements were copied from the successful game Secret of Mana, also released by Squaresoft, such as the controls, the combat system and the ring menu system. It also as a few unique elements of its own. </div>  <div> Characters : Combat is a simple case of facing the main character towards an enemy, and pressing the attack button. At the bottom of the screen there is a 'power bar' for each character. This displays the character's current hit points (HP) and the character's current combat state. If an attack is made, a small counter on the bar quickly fills back up to 100% - if another attack is made before it reaches 100% then that attack is slightly weaker. This means the player must time their attacks correctly to deal the most damage.Holding the attack button down will charge up the power bar. It will fill up as many times as that character has leveled up in their weapon. When the button is released, the character will perform a special attack, which has varying power depending on how long it has been charged. Some special attacks deal more damage, or more hits, or will connect with more enemies at once. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Instead of a traditional magic system, Secret of Evermore has the player come across alchemy ingredients during the game. Alchemy recipes can be learned from different characters, and when the player has collected the right combination of ingredients, they can be converted into one use of the alchemy spell. The spell can be cast any time the player likes after that, however only a limited amount of recipes can be memorized by the character at any one time. Alchemy spells will level up and become stronger with repeated use.The player can also utilize ""call beads"" to summon previously met characters, who can cast more powerful spells. </div> "

It was also one of the few JRPGs at the time to merge fantasy with steampunk technology.It was Tecmo's only foray into RPGs in the early nineties, possibly due to its poor critical reception.

Sengoku,,Data East,Cancelled,snes,"Sengoku is a grand strategy game set in feudal Japan; it is developed by Paradox Interactive, the creators of the Europa Universalis series.",3030-36365,36365,0,2011-09-13,https://www.giantbomb.com/sengoku/3030-36365/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : The colored area shows 2% of Japan; you need to control 50%Sengoku is the first standalone game in Paradox Interactive's long-running grand strategy line - which includes the likes of Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis - to focus on Asia; specifically Japan. Like Crusader Kings, Sengoku focuses more on managing a dynasty rather than a discrete country. The player takes the role of the leader of a clan, made up of various vassals, as they attempt to expand their territory either through diplomacy or war. The only victory condition of the game is to become Shogun of Japan. This is accomplished by gaining control of 50% of Japan, then holding that territory for three consecutive years. </div>  <div> Changes : While past Paradox strategy titles have sacrificed technical clarity in favor of detail and complexity, Paradox has taken strides to ensure Sengoku is their most polished and easy to navigate title at the time of its release. This has been accomplished by streamlining--and in some cases completely removing--certain elements from their previous strategy games.Although Sengoku takes place in real-time, Sengoku is not to be mistaken for a Real-Time Strategy (or RTS) game. There is little unit micromanagement, and resource gathering is relatively laid back. Players can pause the game and browse screens of stats at their leisure. Sengoku is a historical/grand strategy title; a history simulator that does not demand the kind of strategizing titles like Starcraft or Supreme Commander require. Historically, very few Paradox strategy titles have victory conditions beyond gaining the most power and influence by a certain date. This is what differentiates Sengoku from many other Paradox titles.Sengoku has a single clear-cut win state: become Shogun of Japan; as mentioned above, the game ends when a player controls 50% of Japan for 3 years; easier said than done, because every territory not within the 50% (and maybe some traitors within your territory!) will rise up against the would-be Shogun.Seppuku can be a last resort.Bad Boy Points Replaced by HonourThe Badboy (BB) system is a feature used in many Paradox titles, such as Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis III; it is a deceptively important system, because although it is not featured directly on any stat screen, it is affected by a vast array of factors, most of which involve being a bad boy: declaring war unjustly, attempting an assassination and being caught, etc. The honour system diverges from the BB system, as it is featured as a resource, often earned through the expenditure of gold. Thus, it is an inversion of the BB system, and more comprehensively handled. In games like EU III, having a high BB rating would result in random countries frequently declaring war on you. In Sengoku, the system is more dynamic, and linked to the ways in which you comport yourself within that world. Pick a lot of fights? You'll probably see more clans itching to slip a wakizashi between your ribs during the low times. Concern yourself entirely with diplomacy and neglect your army? You'll appear as easy pickings for your rivals. Also important to note is that if at any time your honour falls below a certain threshold, players will be able to commit seppuku. This lets your current heir take the reins of the clan and continue on apace, although, seppuku is not an option if the current heir to your clan is not a part of your bloodline. </div>  <div> Characters : Barely a fraction of the characters in the game.While Total War: Shogun 2 featured hostage exchange as a part of its diplomatic system, it is incorporated much more aggressively within Sengoku, with most clans offering hostage exchange as a traditional part of peace treaties. This system is relatively accurate. Leaders during the Sengoku period of Japanese history would exchange family members (typically children) with rivals to ensure that terms of an agreement or treaty were adhered to. This can become an interesting complication if your leader is relatively impotent (or not sexually mature themselves.) Furthermore, Sengoku allows the player to send mercenary ninja clans on a mission to retrieve hostages from rival clans.It should be noted that Sengoku currently does not have the same amount of character interaction and events that are present in Crusader Kings. Paradox has already stated that they will continue to implement features in the months to come. One can only imagine that it's a matter of time before Sengoku's events system is fleshed out. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Operating System: XP/Vista/Windows7Processor: Intel® Pentium® IV 2.4 GHz or AMD 3500+RAM Memory: 2 GBHard Disk Space: 2 GBVideo Card: NVIDIA® GeForce 8800 or ATI Radeon® X1900Sound Card: DirectX compatibleDirectX®: DirectX 9.0c </div> "
Sensible Soccer: European Champions,Sensible Software,Sony Imagesoft,"June 3, 1994",snes,"The first game in the Sensible Soccer series, released in 1992 only for the Amiga and Atari ST. Enhanced versions and sequels would follow, and these would be published for many consoles and computer systems.",3030-27453,27453,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/sensible-soccer-european-champions/3030-27453/,," <div> Overview : Sensible Soccer is a soccer game, originally for the Amiga, designed to eschew realism in favor of fast-paced gameplay. In this way it followed in the footsteps of earlier soccer games such those in the Kick Off series by Anco, but improved on the formula significantly by providing a much larger view of the pitch, a simpler, yet still deep, control scheme and a notably better, more cartoony, art style. The game featured a selection of teams from the top leagues throughout Europe, as well as better known international teams. The Amiga, ST and PC versions featured real player names but other versions would switch to fictional names due to licensing issues. Teams usually had three star players who could outperform their peers slightly. Teams used a hidden, internal rating system to determine player speed and other attributes.Sensible Soccer would be followed by Sensible Soccer 92/93, an enhanced edition that included new rosters and a few mechanical upgrades. This enhanced version would be the basis for the many console ports that would be created. The various console versions should not be confused with this game, despite the fact that many are simply called ""Sensible Soccer"" or ""Sensible Soccer: European Champions"". </div>  <div> Gameplay : Like those in the Kick Off games, Sensible Soccer's soccer players run around the pitch at what feel like absurd break-neck speeds, particularly to newcomers to the game. For this reason, the increased pitch view is a marked improvement; now the user has a chance to process where their player is headed, what their passing options are, and which opposition players they will need to deal play around. This opened up the opportunity to play a fast flowing passing style of game that felt very rewarding.In yet another parallel to the Kick Off series, the dribbling mechanic in this game was not done in the common video game style at the time. Where most other games favored the 'ball glued to feet' mechanic, Sensible Soccer preferred a looser system, where a dribbling player could easily leave the ball behind if they tried to make sudden turns at speed.The game was played using a simple, one-button control scheme. A tap of the button would pass the ball along the ground in the direction the player was currently running, with a level of auto aiming towards nearby players of the same team. Holding the button down would result in a kick that would loft the ball into the air. From there, the height and power was controlled using an 'aftertouch' system relative to the player's current directional movement; if the joystick remained pushed in the same direction, a low, hard shot would be used. If it was released to a neutral position, a lofted ball would be played. If the joystick was pulled back to the opposite direction, the ball would be given a powerful, distance lob high into the air. On top of this control, left and right swerve could be applied to the ball in varying degrees based on how soon after the kick they were pushed. In a very simple way, Sensible Software had created a system which gave players a huge amount of control over how they played the ball around the field. </div> "

The player is assigned one of two factions to play as: The megacorp RNA Global, or the resistance group known as The Lineage. Playable races are Human, Elf, Troll, and Dwarf. Each race has their own unique racial traits. The game offers online multiplayer for up to 16 players on nine maps (with three smaller versions for 8 players), system link and solo play against bots is also available. There are six training missions that cover basic to intermediate gameplay as well as training for dwarves, elves and trolls. The online component is divided between Public Matches and Private Matches. A Public Match is essentially streamlined matchmaking, the player has few options to choose games, map preferences and player size being the only two options. Shadowrun uses Microsoft's Trueskill ranking system to match players in Public Matches, there is no consistent stat-tracking or leaderboards, but the in-game stats are very comprehensive and detailed. Private Matches are private games set up by players, players set up a game lobby, set the map, a few game options and can choose teams and race(obviously). Private Matches can only be accessed by invite or joining through a players gamercard in the Xbox guide. Note: Achievements can only be earned in a game with at least 4 players on each team in either Public or Private Matches, online or LAN. Shadowrun does not support any split-screen play. </div>  <div> Races : Lineage ElfElves are the fastest race, but also the weakest. They are slowed substantially by heavy weapons and will quickly be killed from sustained fire. However, their speed compensates for this, as well as their ability to heal when not taking damage, after a few seconds and if they have essence available. Elves have the second greatest amount of essence. They are best suited for hit and run tactics, and players that are magic heavy. Elves are arguably the best rezzers because of their high essence count and ability to get in and out of areas quickly. Elves can swoop in, get the rez and get out of the fight, opposed to dwarves who usually have to stay and fight. Elf ninja is popular but only effective if played conservatively and intelligently. Always go for the bleed out because elves do very weak melee damage. Wired Reflexes is not suggested because it severely decreases your essence pool, teleport, smoke and gust are more suited for elves. Elves are the best artifact runners due to their speed.Lineage TrollTrolls are the slowest race, but the strongest. No weapon, no matter how heavy, will slow them down, and they can take an incredible amount of damage, especially with their special ability. When taking sustained fire, a troll will use its essence to harden his skin. This slows it down but allows it to take enormous amounts of damage. Trolls have the same essence as humans, but do not share their tech ability, so they are not great magic or tech users. When a troll is using a katana, they do double the damage of other races and can kill most enemies with two slices. Wired also only locks two essence slots for trolls so it is usually the best tech to use as troll to counter their slow speed. They are best suited for players who forfeit stealth and agility for brute force. Although trolls have the most health, they rely heavily on a tree because they need a lot of hit points their hardening to be effective. If a troll has half health or less they will die as quickly as the other races. So buy a tree first round every time you play troll. Trolls are also good artifact runners when within 30 meters, because they can use their health and hardening ability to charge through defenses to score the artifact.RNA DwarfDwarves are a slightly more specialized race than either the Trolls or the Elves. They are slightly faster than trolls and fairly strong, not being hampered much by heavier weapons. Dwarves can take a good deal of damage(but be warned, their round bodies perfectly fit into most guns reticules so they get hit by most of the shots fired) and as a bonus they can withstand a direct headshot from a sniper rifle(dwarves are not effected by the headshot modifier for weapons), which is fatal for any other race. This ability makes dwarves good counter-snipers/riflers. Their special ability is that they can steal essence from other players (friend or foe) and from magical objects like strangle and minions. However, dwarves regenerate essence very slowly when not draining from other sources, but have lots of essence at their disposal. In addition, dwarves are able to withstand a surprise attack from a katana and not bleed ou t. Dwarves are very tactical and are best played as a specialist race. Dwarves are suited both for magic specialization or tech use, but mixing magic and tech is not recommended. Dwarves are good companions for Trolls, because they have similar stats and uses.RNA HumanHumans are the middle ground of the races. They are the second fastest after elves and second most resilient after trolls. Humans have several small advantages that give them a unique play style. First, none of their essence is locked by tech, as it is with all other races. Second, they start the first round with an extra 500 dollars, which can be a huge advantage during the first few rounds. Humans are also quite versatile, they can do a bit of everything. Humans are the best suited for slaying and ranged combat (especially the rifle). Humans are best suited for recon with Enhanced Vision, as well as using Wired Reflexes, and Smartink. As with trolls and elves make sure teleport is one of your main abilities for most of your games.Players can purchase magic, tech, and weapons at the beginning of each round of play. At the beginning of the first round they have $2000, except humans who have $2500. Each new round adds $1400 for each player, plus money the player earns by helping his or her team during each match, whether through killing enemies, supporting friendlies(rez, healing with trees, assisting in kills), or focusing on the objective. Money can also be lost by team killing or damaging during the round. Rounds are either won by killing all enemies(all game modes), scoring the artifact, or defending artifact(in Raid). More money is earned when teams score the artifact in Extraction and Raid, or if the defenders defend the artifact by the rounds end in Raid, and finally, in Attrition the team who posesses the artifact at the end of the round will win and earn more money. Matches are a best of eleven series, first to six wins. </div>  <div> Levels : Area 1Waking UpGetting to know the placeMore of the PlaceThe CemeteryWhere will fate guide us?Area 2The Arena...How to get out of this dump...?More StuffTime to finish what we started.Before we do anything else...Area 3Get this out of my head!Rust StilettosKitsune, Cat WomanThe Insane JesterDark Blades, Drake's HandymenThe Mysterious Ship, BremertonInside the BremertonKill the Jester!Getting to DrakeIt's hot in here...Last Stop, Aneki... </div>  <div> Magic Options : Teleport ($2250): Enables users to instantly warp 8-10 meters in the direction of their movement, even through solid objects. Can be used in combination with the Glider tech to obtain maximum mobility. Three pips of essence per cast, one second buffer time. One of the most important abilities in the game. Countered by dwarves, Anti-Magic Generators and Gust.Resurrect ($2000): Allows a player to bind fallen teammates to their own life energy in order to bring them back to life. This also works to stop teammates from ""bleeding out"". When players are bound through resurrection, the caster must sacrifice some of their maximum essence. Four essence pips will be used for cast, then locked if successful. ""Karma"" can change these values to 3, 2 or 1 based on how many rounds your team is losing by. Players can also be rezzed multiple times in Karma rounds, and bodies take longer to clear in Karma rounds.Strangle ($2000): Produces a field of crystals which restricts the movement and drains the essence of any player caught amongst them. Does minimal damage, but can kill players with low health. Locks two essence slots while active as elf, troll, human and three for dwarves. Most effectively used by dwarves and elves. Countered by weapons fire, grenades, AMG's, and dwarves.Summon ($3000): Summons a creature which can either be ordered to defend an area, attacking all enemies nearby, or ordered to directly pursue an individual target, which it will relentlessly hunt until its destruction. Though powerful, summons are very weak to essence-draining magic and tech, and they will also abandon any orders in order to attack another summon, be it hostile or friendly. Minions attack with ther claws and can cause a lot of damage in close quarters. Effective against trolls, groups of enemies, and enemies who are bleeding out. Countered by weapons fire, grenades, AMG's, dwarves, other minions.Gust ($2000): A burst of powerful wind that can push enemies and objects away, and if timed carefully, can break a player's fall. Players hit by gust will find their accuracy lowered for a short period of time. In addition, gust is the only way to damage players using the Smoke magic. Gust can multiply the effectiveness of glider by gusting then activating glider (called Gust-Gliding). Very versatile magic rewards clever use. Common practice is gusting nades back to enemies or using gust to launch your own nade (poor-mans rocket launcher), gust bodies to rez or prevent multi-rez or push bodies off map, instantly clearing the body instantly. Only effective counter is essence drain, be it dwarves or AMG's (preventing cast).Smoke ($2000): Allows a player to turn their body to smoke, causing bullets, explosions, and falls to cause no damage, though being hit with Gust or the artifact will cause significant harm. Players with smoke mapped cannot be seen by Enhanced Vision (20 meters and above) and completely undetected when activated. While in smoke your essence will drain one pip at a time until deactivated or you run out of essence. Having smoke mapped also slows you essence regeneration rate by about 25%, for dwarves this completely stops their essence regen and can only gain essence with their ability. Countered by gust, AMG's, and dwarves. When deactivating smoke you cannot use your weapons, magic or tech for about 2 seconds, leaving you vulnerable.Tree of Life ($2000): Creates a tree that heals anyone nearby, as well as providing a physical barrier that can be used for cover. Lasts until it heals a certain amount of damage, or is destroyed by enemy fire. The closer you are to tree the faster you will heal. Will heal friend or foe alike, three pips per cast, 30 second buffer time. Countered by grenades and weapon fire, AMG's, strangle, and dwarves. </div>  <div> Tech Options : Grenade (Free with Spawn): Allows the player to throw grenades. The player starts with two, and can pick up and replace any used from dead enemies or teammates. Can instantly kill all but trolls within 3 meters of enemy (or friendly). Can also be used to knock enemies bodies off map.Enhanced Vision ($2000): Allows the player to detect nearby enemies, as well as teammates, through walls. Effective up to 60 meters, a cast sends out a pulse that lasts 5 seconds then cannot be activated again for 3 seconds. Note: Having EV mapped will allow the player to see enemy EV users when they cast the pulse (Passive EV). Countered by smoke, EV, artifact in attrition.Glider ($2000): Enables short-distance flight and enhanced leaping height. Can also be used to negate fall damage. Locks two essence, best combined with teleport and gust. Gliding players are vulnerable to sniper rifles and rifles due to their slow aerial movement. Gust can deactivate glider wings for one second, forcing player to lose flight momentarily and draw them downward. When gliding activate and deactivate to increase forward movement.Wired Reflexes ($2000): Passively enhance the player's running speed, jumping height and reload speed while equipped and allow the deflection of bullets when wielding a Katana. Can be activated for an extra boost of speed at the expense of some health. When combined with teleport or glider (or both) mobility is greatly increased. Very effective for trolls, countered by gust.Anti-Magic Generators ($1500): Thrown like a grenade, these devices drain essence of any player or magical object caught within their field. Can be devastating if used against Trolls (who lose their armor ability) or Strangle spells. Four in inventory that recharge over time when current AMG's are destroyed or run out. Countered by weapons fire, glider (most AMG's will be on the floor). Players cannot teleport effectively into area covered by an AMG, and when looking directly at one, teleport distance is reduced to one meter.Smartlink ($2000): Implants an ocular aiming system which assists players by increasing auto aim and magnetism (target-lock) and automatically preventing firearms from firing when a teammate is in the cross hair. However, when activated, Smartlink is visible by a red laser beam that emerges from the players eye. Adds level of zoom to all weapons except katana. Locks two pips of essence. Recommended for minigun users. Countered by having smoke mapped. </div>  <div> Weapons : Katana ($1000): The only melee weapon of the lot, this weapon deals a moderate amount of damage (high damage when wielded by troll), has no movement penalty and can kill most races within four swipes. It is capable of causing a player much grief by inflicting a ""mortal wound"" on an unsuspecting player, which deals a high amount of damage and makes the enemy lose health over a period of time, which can only be cured by the resurrection spell. Recommended mostly for trolls and elves. Countered by gust, shotgun ( if user has wired), sustained weapons fire.SMG ($500): The SMG is a cheap, low damage close to mid-range weapon that reloads quickly and features a high rate of fire. It is lightweight, making it a good weapon regardless of race or playing style, but it has a high amount of recoil and is best fired in short, controlled bursts when firing at a distance. Countered by shogun in close range and rifle at farther distances. Gusting SMG users back decreases their effectiveness moderately.Pistol (Free with Spawn): This is your standard, cost-free weapon. The pistol causes low to moderate damage but its accuracy, rate of fire, and no movement penalty make up for it. Highly effective against trolls (especially when shot slowly at troll's head).Rifle ($500): Deals moderate to high damage (headshot deals double damage to all but dwarves) with little recoil at a low price, which makes it a good and popular weapon overall. It is highly useful for damaging enemies at moderate to long ranges, and for marksmen who cannot afford a Sniper Rifle. Humans are ideal rifle users, but all races can benefit from its use. Stay crouched while firing to greatly increase effectiveness. Three shot burst not recommended.Rocket Launcher ($5000): The rocket launcher reigns supreme as the most powerful weapon in the game and, simultaneously the most expensive and the heaviest. It takes a fair while to fire and reload is not very useful against enemies past close to mid-range. $1000 per round. Best used by trolls and dwarves. Use extreme caution when using.Shotgun ($750): A brilliant and cost effective weapon, which can easily stop a charging enemy. A point blank shot deals a massive amount of damage, which decreases as range increases. It's primary drawbacks are its limited range and low rate of fire. Great when combined with wired reflexes. Not recommended for elves due to weight. Shotgun cannot be blocked by wired katana.Minigun ($1250): This bulky weapon makes up for its weight with a lighting fast rate of fire, good stopping power and massive clip size. Recommended for dwaves and trolls, minigun must be wound up to fire, keep the barrels spinning by tapping trigger to begin firing more quickly.Sniper Rifle ($2500): Features 4 shots to a clip and is rather expensive, however, this gun is quite powerful in the hands of a skilled marksman. A single shot to the head will kill all but dwarfs. Can only be fired if zoomed in using the scope, and taking damage will force the player to back out of the zoom. Not recommended for trolls.The game lacks a traditional campaign mode. Instead, various match types are available - solo play against bots, private matches (online or LAN), and live matches which match up players from around the world. The three play modes available are Attrition (Team Deathmatch variant), Extraction (Neutral Flag), and Raid mode (One flag, attack/defend CTF). Each map has two of these three game modes, usually Raid or Extraction and Attrition. Raid being the most common. Some maps also have a reduced-size variant which is reserved for smaller games. </div>  <div> Minimum System Requirements : Microsoft® Windows® Vista™PC with Dual Core CPU2 GB of system RAM4.5 GB available hard disk spaceNVIDIA 7800, ATI X1800 (256 MB or higher) </div>  <div> Xbox 360 Game Installation : Shadowrun requires 3.9GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.

Side Pocket,Iguana Entertainment,Data East,December 1993,snes,"Data East's signature pocket billiards arcade game, featuring a simplistic ruleset (known as ""Pocket Game"") and an intuitive shot system that allows for precise directional aiming and trick shots.",3030-2042,2042,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/side-pocket/3030-2042/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Side Pocket is a top-down billiards game developed and released by Data East for arcades in June 1986.One of the earliest arcade pool simulators released for arcades, Side Pocket builds on the formula of other top-down billiards games (such as Video Hustler and Super Billiards) by introducing several gameplay mechanics that were later made standard (including the use of rotation instead of a free-form cursor, a preview trajectory for the cue ball, and the ability to alter which part of the cue ball is hit for spins and trick shots).The game's standard mode, later known as ""Pocket Game"", has players attempting to pocket all balls (other than the cue ball) on the table with a limited amount of lives (or ""balls""), with bonus points awarded both for consecutively pocketing balls and for pocketing balls in sequence. In addition, players are given opportunities to sink a ball at a designated pocket to earn bonus points, bonus time, or bonus lives. It also features a post-round mini-game where players have one chance to make a specific trick shot. Home releases added the game of 9-Ball as an alternate multiplayer mode.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, the Game Boy in 1990, the Sega Genesis in 1992, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, and the Game Gear in 1994. These versions include various improvements, such as a new single-player progression system (where players progress by having high-scoring rounds), an improved spin system (with fine-tuned shots, massé shots, and jump shots), and new gameplay mechanics (such as ""super balls"" and ""zones"").Along with its eroge spin-offs Pocket Gal and Pocket Gal Deluxe, the game received three sequels in Japan: Side Pocket 2: Densetsu no Hustler (which was released in North America as Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend), Side Pocket 3 (which brought the series into full 3D), and Side Pocket for WonderSwan. The original arcade version was also included in the Wii compilation Data East Arcade Classics. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Side Pocket, players control each shot of the cue ball in a top-down perspective (similar to other pool simulation games of the time). Before each shot, players have three options:They can select which direction to hit the cue ball using the joystick, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory. For precise aiming, the game has players holding down the joystick in a particular direction to begin rotating the cursor towards it.They can use the Spin button and the joystick to change which part of the ball to spin it. Home ports build upon this by allowing multiple levels of each type of spin (including hidden massé shots). Left/Right shots curve the ball in either direction once it hits an object, Draw shots has the cue ball retreat once it hits an object, and Follow shots has the cue ball push forward once it hits an object. Massé shots are unique in that it has the cue ball spin backwards (and optionally left/right) soon after it is shot, and can also be used to launch the ball into the air over other balls.They then perform the shot itself by hitting the Shot button (to start the Power Meter). The Power Meter swings left and right, and players press the Shot button to lock-in the power of the shot and hit it. In some versions, players can cancel the shot using a Cancel button. </div>  <div> Ports : In the standard ""Pocket Game"", players start each set with one of two alternate racks of balls: six balls in a standard pyramid formation (similar to the game of 6-Ball) or nine balls in a thin diamond formation (similar to the game of 9-Ball). Home versions also include a ten-ball pyramid formation (similar to the games of 8-Ball and 10-Ball). Players can pocket each ball in the rack any order, and the set ends when all of these balls are pocketed.Similar to other billiards games at the time, players have a limited amount of shots (or ""balls"") that deplete if the player either pockets the cue ball (for two shots) or fails to pocket any other ball (for one shot). Pocketing the cue ball also causes the other pocketed balls in that shot to return to the table. In addition, the Arcade version of the game has a timer that slowly depletes when the player is figuring out their shot (and can be replenished by pocketing balls). Once the timer or allowed shots depletes, the credit ends and players must add additional credits to continue. In Home versions, there is no timer and players are given more shots to start out with, but players cannot continue.At certain times in the round, one pocket is highlighted and if players pocket a ball in there, they receive bonus points. In the Arcade version, this can be bonus time. In single-player modes, this can be bonus balls. In Home versions of the game, having one racked ball remaining causes one pocket to highlight as the ""Zone"" and players can hit their cue ball in there to enter a special state where if they pocket the final ball in that shot, they earn additional bonus balls. In addition, the Home versions include a ""super shot"" where at certain times, hitting the 9-Ball or 10-Ball causes the table to have less friction (making the shot more hectic).In addition to points earned by pocketing balls and by bonus points, players are scored after each set by each sequence of balls pocketed consecutively and by each sequence of balls pocketed in a numerical sequence, with longer sequences earning more points. In Home versions, high-scoring sets are required to progress through the game. The game also includes a bonus ""trick shot"" between sets, where the table is set-up in a particular way (usually with obstacles) and players must pot balls in specific pockets without hitting obstacles in order to gain additional bonus points.In two-player multiplayer matches, players attempt to end a multi-set match with the highest score (with no ""trick shot"" mini-game). Players do not have a limited amount of balls to work with, instead switching between each player once they either pocket the cue ball or fail to pocket any ball. The Home versions do not include Super Shots or Zones. </div> "

It was released in the US on March 5, 2013 for Windows PC. The game was released in Australia, Japan, and most of Europe on March 7, 2013, as in Europe, and in the UK on March 8, 2013. A Mac version was released later in the year.As in its predecessors, the game puts the player in control of planning, building, and maintaining a simulated city. As the mayor of a virtual city, the player is given information and statistics regarding pollution, public happiness, crime rates, water levels, etc., to help make decisions about how to build and run the city. The player's responsibilities include laying roads, setting zoning, controlling the power and water supply, managing public services like education and health, setting taxes, managing sewerage and waste, trading supplies with neighboring cities, and more. </div>  <div> Gameplay : An example of zoning from SimCity 3000After a ten-year hiatus following the release of SimCity 4, the previous major installment in the franchise, developer Maxis underwent a lengthy development cycle to create a new SimCity experience. As the name implies, SimCity is presented as a reboot of sorts for the series; while it doesn't necessarily reinvent the game entirely, many of the systems have been re-imagined and streamlined.One major change is to zoning. In previous games in the series, the player could only lay down squares of residential, commercial, and industrial zones in low, medium, and high density varieties. In SimCity, the player assigns residential, commercial, or industrial zones along roads rather than in a grid. Zones will gradually become more dense over time as demand rises. Whereas zoning in previous games would require spending simoleons, zoning is free in SimCity.Maxis has also streamlined how resources, such as power, water, and sewage, are propagated through cities. The player no longer has to manually lay underground pipes and power lines, instead, resources in SimCity flow through roads. Because roads now carry all the resources in and out of the city, road design is even more important, and as such roads are also more costly. </div>  <div> MAC OS Version : Due to the game's focus on multiple players sharing a landmass, SimCity was designed with an always-online connection requirement in mind. All cities and regions within SimCity are saved on EA's central servers, requiring an internet connection and authentication through the Origin client before a person can play the game. While also serving as DRM, this system allows players to interact with not only other cities in real time, but a larger global market for buying and selling resources. The game can be run in sandbox mode to allow players more freedom to create whatever they want, but they cannot interact with other cities and the global economy in sandbox mode.As of the game's tenth update, the always-online connection requirement will be disabled. Players will be able to play the game in an offline single-player mode, though aspects such as the limited city sizes will remain unchanged. </div>  <div> Reception : SimCity retains the scope of previous games, but scales back some gameplay aspects in order to expand upon others. For example, cities are scaled back in geographic size and are not as large as in previous games. This design decision is attributed to the game's GlassBox engine, which was purposefully developed for this SimCity game, and is said to visually represent every element that makes up a city. As an example, each citizen (also called a ""Sim"") will be seen performing daily tasks, such as walking around, going to work, driving to school, and heading home. The GlassBox engine also allows players to view the individual wants and desires of each Sim in a city.Due to the amount of data that is visually represented within the game, the size of any one city had to be made smaller so that the game could be playable on a larger range of computer hardware. This also made cities much less self-sustainable, which in turn pushes players to take advantage of the always-online multiplayer to interact with other players in the same region, in order to share resources and ease management of cities. </div>  <div> Special Editions : One of the new primary additions to the franchise is the ""Social Flow"", or the ability of the player's city to impact other cities surrounding it, in what's called a region. Each region can have up to 16 cities within it. Players can choose to control each city plot within their region, or to open plots up to allow friends or any other SimCity players to be able to build in the region. This can lead to both positive and negative effects. For example, a player can create an entirely industrial city that provides jobs for people living in another nearby city, but pollution from the industrial city may also make its way to that same residential neighborhood. The game also allows the sharing of resources between cities, letting players sell any and all resources and waste, from electricity to garbage, to other cities within a region.Each region has one region-wide project that multiple cities can contribute money and resources to completing. Cities can also be abandoned, opening them up to other players. </div>  <div> DLC : In SimCity buildings and structures are customizable tooSimilarly to the editor in Spore, individual buildings can be upgraded and modified in a modular manner. For example, instead of buying two coal plants and placing them next to each other, the player can add extra smokestacks to an existing plant, increasing its capacity. This even applies to utilities such as police and fire stations, which can be made more effective through upgrades. </div>  <div> Closed Beta : According to a blog post on the official SimCity website, the delay between the PC and Mac releases of the game is due to the Mac version being a native MAC OS application, as opposed to a port of the Windows version. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The game was initially generally well-received by game critics, at one point holding a metacritic score of 95 out of 100. However, reviews submitted after the game's release to the public were far more negative due to the persistent server issues which, by nature of the game's always-online gameplay and DRM requirements, heavily impacted the experience of playing the game. SimCity currently holds a metacritic score of 71 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, a reception that the review-aggregator website qualifies as ""generally favorable"".The current metacritic user score is very negative, averaging at 1.6 out of 10 based on over 2690 ratings - the vast majority of which gave the game a score of 4 or less.Publication (aggregators in bold)ScoreUser Score Avg.Metacritic79/1001.6 out of 10GameRankings76.12%n/aGiant Bomb3/51.67 out of 5GameSpot5.0/103.8 out of 10Game Trailers8.0/106.4 out of 10PC Gamer69/100n/aPolygon4/10n/aRuss Pitts of Polygon originally gave the game a 9.5, lauding the game as a well-engineered addictive experience in which ""every element of this game has been perfectly and patiently engineered to engender an endorphin rush of accomplishment"", concluding that SimCity ""is in every way the fully realized evolution of the franchise and a much welcome iteration"". Giant Bomb's own Alex Navarro was less positive in his review, giving the game a 3 out of 5 score, along with a very mixed narrative. He wrote that SimCity felt like two different games, one of them ""a brilliant, vibrantly realized reboot of Maxis' classic SimCity franchise"" and the other a ""stricter game... one more dedicated to a single-minded way of cooperative thinking"". Implementation of a standard size-limit to every city drew criticismAlex negatively dubbed the always-on co-op multiplayer facet SimCity a ""skeletal structure in which the city building meat of the game has been somewhat awkwardly stuffed into"", while Pitts said that he enjoyed seeing ""disparate towns form an interconnected whole that is stronger than its parts"", but also cautioned that the ""fun of cooperation will, of course, vary depending on with whom you are attempting to cooperate"".Reviews published days after the game's launch were far more negative in their appreciation, since the server issues were unexpectedly persisting. Online publications such as GameSpot which occasionally publish a review prior to a game's release seemingly waited out to account server issues into their review. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot gave SimCity a 5.0 stating ""SimCity is both a fun city builder and a broken product, equal parts joy and misery"". </div> "
SimCity 2000,THQ,Black Pearl Software,November 1996,snes,"SimCity 2000 is a city simulation game where players can build cities from small and neat to large and dirty, or anything in between.",3030-13760,13760,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/simcity-2000/3030-13760/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : SimCity 2000 is the second game in the SimCity franchise, first released in 1993 for Mac and DOS. A Windows playable version, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995. SimCity 2000 was also ported to many consoles, ranging from the SNES to the GBA, and is also available on PSN.What a city!SimCity 2000 adds many features that were missing from the original. With new tools in transportation, zoning, and infrastructure, as well as a isometric view and a smoother UI, SimCity 2000 gives players more freedom than the original SimCity to create cities. With no real goal, the game instead directs players by consequence, being given a set of tools and set loose on a dynamic play area. Given enough money, the player can use the tools in any way they want, but if their cities are not generating income, the money will soon run dry. Players will find that to function, cities need utilities, civic services, transport infrastructure, and a fragile balance between homes and jobs. Playing within (and sometimes outside) the limits of the rules and seeing what works is part of the game. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In SimCity 2000, the player starts off with a randomly generated piece of land, which could be terraformed to their liking. The player then builds a city, providing it with necessary utilities and civic structures. They also need to balance their budget, their income coming from rent and taxes, and their expenditure from building and maintaining the city. If they run below a certain budget deficit, they will be kicked out of the mayor's office, losing the game.Undeveloped ZonesThere are 3 main types of buildings in SimCity 2000: Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI). They are not built by the player directly. Instead, the player ""zones"" certain plots of land for specific development. Zones are the main type development in any city in the SimCity franchise, and what grows in those zones are determined by the amounts of utilities and services that plot can receive, and the land value of the area. Players can also zone landfills, air and seaports, and military bases. These zones are not as affected by land value as RCI zones but they will drastically affect their surrounding areas negatively.Land value is an important factor in SimCity 2000, and can be raised or lowered by the presence or absence of water features, trees, and pollution. It can also be affected presence or absence of civic structures, power and water supply, and good transport infrastructure. Rewards, special buildings given to the player for reaching certain population milestones, also help to boost land value of the area. </div>  <div> Expansions : Arcologies are special futuristic buildings, rewarded to players once they reach a city population of 120,000 and they are after the year that they are invented. There are 4 arcologies in SimCity 2000: Plymouth Arco, Forest Arco, Darco, and the Launch Arco. Arcologies provide the city with a huge boost in population, the smallest one (Forest Arco) providing 30,000 residents, and the mighty Launch Arco giving a massive 60,000 residents.Launch Arcos also have a special effect. After building 300 Launch Arcos, a special message ""The exodus has begun."" will appear, and the they will ""launch"" (in reality, just explode). The player will then be compensated for the construction costs after all the Launch Arcos have been launched. This only occurs in the PC and Mac versions of the game. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Disasters will hamper a player's construction of their cities (unless they turned it off). These disasters are random, and range from mundane (a fire), to the extreme (monster invasions). Players can also activate these disasters purposely to destroy their cities for fun. There are 8 disasters in the game:Fire: An inferno blazes through the city. Fire stations help put it out.Flood: Waters flood into the city. Dispatch emergency services to limit floods.Air Crash: A plane crashes into the city and starts fires.Tornado: A rampaging tornado rips up trees and buildings.Earthquake: An earthquake destroys both buildings and underground infrastructure.Monster: A giant sphere with an huge eye descends on the city, and sets things on fire with its laser beams.Hurricane: A hurricane destroys buildings and cause flooding.Rioters: Unhappy Sims protest on the streets and start fires. Police presence helps to limit rioting. </div> "

Both versions were released in North America on July 1992 and in Europe (by Taito) sometime in 1992.While both versions differ in various ways, the overall concept is the same: players guide an anthropomorphic monkey (humorously named ""Spanky"" in the Western releases) around multi-layered playfields as he climbs his way up multiple towers to defeat the evil witch Morticia, who has turned all the fruits and vegetables of the kingdom of Mopoland into fiendish monsters. His sole weapons are magical balls (bubbles in the SNES version) which stun enemies and grow as they bounce on his head. He can burst these balls at any time, forming one of four types of ""ball blasts"" (depending on the ball's size) that damage all enemies they touch.The GB version of the game.The original Game Boy version was more oriented towards arcade-style action, similar to Bubble Bobble and Snow Bros.: Nick & Tom. In this version, Spanky progresses through each stage by defeating all enemies. This version includes bonus score pickups, including special ""letter"" pickups (formed by eliminating more than one enemy with the same blast) that allow access to the bonus stage once the word SPANKY (MONKEY in the Japanese version) is formed.The SNES version changes the formula to be more puzzle-oriented, as Spanky must now unlock doors with keys scattered throughout each playfield. Much of the game's assets have changed, with larger, more different stages, a new appearance for the titular monkey, bubbles that change color as they get larger, and ball blasts taking the form of different sports balls (baseballs, soccer balls, volleyballs, and basketballs). This version includes new power-ups (in the form of wearable hats) and traps and obstacles, such as secret blocks breakable by un-popped bubbles (some of which reveal secret doors for the bonus stage) and cannons that send Spanky and his enemies to a different part of the stage.The SNES version of the game.The Western releases of the SNES version received multiple changes, including a new introduction cut-scene, the absence of the map screen, and an updated ending cutscene. Some of the stage arrangements were changed, as the tutorial stages of the first Tower were replaced by the stages of the second Tower, with the second Tower now comprising of new stages.

Like many of those competitors, Sparkster is a 2D platformer starring an anthropomorphic animal. The twist in this game is Sparkster's rocket pack, which can be used to fly around the level in eight directions for short bursts. Sparkster's quality and pedigree as a Konami game helped ensure it would be more memorable than  Bubsy or  Aero the Acro-Bat ever were.Sparkster is not to be confused with Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, which was a direct sequel to the original Rocket Knight Adventures exclusive to the Genesis/Mega Drive. The US/EU version of Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is known as just Sparkster, making it easy to confuse with this SNES spin-off. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Sparkster controls like a typical 2D platformer. Many areas feature thin ledges that can be grabbed by Sparkster's prehensile tail and climbed around on. A regular attack with the sword also launches a projectile across the screen, and holding down the button after attacking will charge the rocket pack, which takes about a second. Once charged, holding a direction and releasing the button will send Sparkster shooting away. While dashing with the rocket pack Sparkster will ricochet wildly off walls, floors and ceilings, which is sometimes the only way to reach a certain area. Sparkster can also use a flip move by pressing the R and L buttons, which will cause Sparkster to quickly flip right or left. This can be done in mid air and is a great way to get around, but using it too many times in a row makes Sparkster dizzy and unable to move for a while.In addition, Sparkster has a few unique levels that switch up the gameplay. There's a level where Sparkster pilots giant mechanical ostriches, which run automatically. He can fire ripple laser shots from the bird's mouth and make it go up and down to grab crystals as it speeds by. Towards the end of the game, there is a section where the player controls the game as a top-down shooter. That level's boss fight involves piloting a fighting mech, which is controlled by pressing the R and L buttons to punch with the respective hand. </div> "

In this brawler the player controls Spider-Man or Venom as they join forces against the psychopathic Carnage.The game structure is divided by stages and each stage may be side or top-down scroller. For the majority of them, the player can move the character on a Z-Axis, as seen with classic games like Golden Axe or Final Fight.The gameplay involves a lot of button mashing for getting combos and sending the enemies to the void. There's no character upgrades nor is there any level progression.The story is told mainly by comic book style cutscenes between stages, that brings to the player the original comic art with some minor animations. </div>  <div> Story : The game opens in Ravencroft Asylum, where Cletus Kasady -- a maniacal killer who carries ""Carnage"", a spawn of the Venom symbiote -- is being escorted to a cell. The Carnage symbiote emerges during the escort, and, after gaining control of Kasady, kills all of the guards in the complex. Carnage meets Shriek, a woman with the ability to manipulate sound into concussive blasts, and they gather a ""family"" of villains -- including Doppelganger (a six-armed Spider-Man look-alike whose mask is adorned with gruesome teeth and whose web is made of barbed wire), Demogoblin (a demon that bears likeness to the Hobgoblin), and Carrion (a man infected with a virus that grants him the ability to turn organic matter into ash). With their group assembled, the ""family"" begins a killing spree in New York, the likes of which have never been seen.Spider-Man, seeing the effect Carnage's crusade is having on the thug community of New York, tries to stop the riots in the streets with a hands-on approach that, after a confrontation with Shriek and Doppelganger, nearly kills him. Cloak and Dagger intervene before a vicious gang step in with the killing stroke, and Cloak teleports Spider-Man to a nearby church. Having followed Spider-Man to his temporary resting place, Shriek and Doppelganger attack the trio of heroes, and though they fight valiantly, Carnage announces his presence with authority by stabbing Dagger. Content with the chaos he's created, Carnage leaves the church with his compatriots.Eddie Brock, the man carrying the ""Venom"" symbiote, sees the reports of Carnage's rampage in the newspaper the following morning. His anger wells, and Venom imposes itself quickly over Brock's will. Venom devotes himself to reaching New York before Carnage destroys more lives.Venom arrives in New York to confront Carnage, who is both surprised and quite pleased his symbiotic counterpart has come to join the chaos, but Carnage commits both Shriek and Doppelganger to stop Venom. A brutal battle wages between the three warriors, and Venom's might is admirable, but the combined power of the ""family"" proves greater than the resolve of the elder symbiote. Knowing defeat, Venom escapes with his life and plants his broken body on the doorstep of Peter Parker.Carnage allows Demogoblin to begin his assault on Manhattan, and Spider-Man, understanding the gravity of the situation, takes an oath to align himself with Venom in order to stop Kasady's madness. Venom takes on Demogoblin, while Spider-Man fights his way through waves of gang members to reach Carnage's ad hoc headquarters -- a nightclub called ""The Deep"". Spider-Man's newfound rage leads him through a gauntlet battle against the bulk of Carnage's crew, but when the ""family"" manages to escape, it becomes duly apparent that a new plan is necessary to unbalance and overthrow Carnage's reign over the fear of the city.Venom suggests Carnage, despite his heightened strengths, may still be vulnerable to the same weaknesses against which Venom falters. Spider-Man decides to infiltrate the laboratory of Reed Richards to obtain the Fantastic Four's Sonic Gun, as the symbiote only appears weak to sonic sound waves and fire.After obtaining Richards's sonic gun, the group of heroes (now aided by fire-manipulating Firestar) manage to lure Carnage and his troops to Prospect Park, where a heated battle erupts between all of the heroes. The conflict culminates with the heroes seemingly victorious, and Firestar uses a plume of flames to end Carnage's reign forever. Spider-Man, however, refuses to bring himself to the level of a maniac like Kasady, and orders Firestar to stop before Kasady dies along with the symbiote. Venom grows angry at Spider-Man's empathy and self-righteousness, and provokes Parker into a brawl that escalates into Venom knocking Spider-Man down a steep hill and proclaiming his unending hate for the webslinger. The heroes rush to Spider-Man's aid, leaving Venom alone with Carnage and Shriek, who regain their energy and overwhelm Venom, whisking him away with the Sonic Gun in-hand.Holding Venom hostage in the Statue of Liberty, Carnage tortures him by holding him above a fire, and shooting him with intermittent blasts from the Sonic Gun, allowing the symbiote to neither dissipate completely nor fully regain its vigor. Spider-Man and ever-increasing cascade of heroes (Captain America now joins the group) continue their push against the ""family,"" but Venom manages to free himself, willing the symbiote to bat the Sonic Gun out of Carnage's hand and escape from the Statue of Liberty. He meets with Spider-Man in the now-riotous streets of Manhattan for a final clash against Shriek and the minions, and they overcome both the ""family"" and Carnage when he arrives in pursuit of Venom.Comfortable that Carnage has been dealt with, Spider-Man and Venom have a last interchange in Central Park. Peace washes over New York as the sun rises over the horizon and a serene silence signifies the end of the reign of terror. As the two unlikely heroes begin to part ways, Carnage arises -- nearly completely regenerated -- from the nearby lake to do battle once more. Fearing the conflict has no end, Spider-Man grows weary and edges near defeat, yet the Avengers arrive as Carnage is dealt a final, crushing blow, and it seems certain Carnage will never be free again. </div> "

Star Fox 2,Nintendo/Argonaut Games,Nintendo,"March 23, 1993",snes,"Star Fox 2 was fully developed Super Nintendo game left unreleased until 2017, when it was sold in all regions as part of the Super NES Classic edition. Later installments in the Star Fox franchise would implement Star Fox 2's mechanical and story elements as their own.",3030-21650,21650,0,2017-09-29,https://www.giantbomb.com/star-fox-2/3030-21650/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : After the success that was Star Fox, Nintendo continued to do research and development on the Super FX micro chip technology that was created in 1993 to make a game like Star Fox possible. Games like Vortex and even Stunt Race FX saw an improved version of the Super FX chip, but there was never a drastic change in the technology.That was the case until Nintendo developed the Super FX 2 chip, capable of rendering approximately 1000 polygons per second over a considerable draw distance. This technology would be used on Star Fox 2, a game which never actually saw the light of day. The game was canceled due to the upcoming release of the Nintendo 64, according to Dylan Cuthbert, one of the game's programmers.Features originating in Star Fox 2 were later implemented in future games in the Star Fox franchise. The new aiming mode, which gave players complete control over where a shot was being fired, was included as ""all-range mode"" in Star Fox 64, while the strategy features of the game can be found in Star Fox Command.On September 29th, 2017, Star Fox 2 was finally officially released as a part of the SNES Classic Edition. </div>  <div> Story : After Andross' defeat on the planet of Venom he managed to escape with his life. Though the Lylat System is in a state of peace, it will not last for long. Andross, bitter from his miserable defeat, toils to create a new invasion army. An army of fighters, carriers, bio-genetically engineered creatures, and team made up of four mercenary pilots. Andross wastes no time in rallying his invasion army and waging total war on every world of the Lylat system. Planet after planet falls under Andross' control until Corneria is the one world yet to be conquered. Just when all hope seems to be lost, the Cornerians fight back with Fox McCloud and the Star Fox team at the forefront of it all. With new ships, weapons, and allies, the ultimate fight for Corneria and all of the Lylat System begins! </div>  <div> Gameplay : Star Fox 2's gameplay is similar in style to its predecessor, with several refinements and changes. Aside from having three different difficulty modes that have a steady graduation of difficulty, the game has a non-linear style of play that allows players to tackle certain missions out of order. Another change that stands as huge departure from the structure of Star Fox is the combination of multiple genres of game styles.Star Fox 2, at its core, is a 3D space shooter as well as a real-time strategy game. To navigate from one mission to another the player must guide their ships to a mission area which could be anything from a cluster of fighters, missiles, or carriers to oppressed planets and so on and so forth. There are many boss fights in Star Fox 2, but they don't necessarily happen at the end of a level like other common conventions would dictate. The boss fights count as totally separate missions that chase down the player's ship on the map.Another aspect introduced in Star Fox 2 is the real-time clock system. Before the player makes a choice on where to move (done by moving a cursor about the system map), time stands still. However, if the player is moving or is currently in a mission, the clock starts ticking. While the player is in the heat of battle anything can happen on the world map and to Corneria. When the game is paused a small version of the map shows on the screen and updates itself dynamically to give the player a chance to see if Corneria is in immediate danger or not. There may be occurrences where Corneria will be attacked by one of Andross' forces. When that happens Corneria will accumulate damage shown as a percentage. If that percentage reaches 100%, then Andross succeeds in conquering Corneria and the game ends.This game introduces a new aiming format, which would later be adapted to Star Fox 64 as ""all-range mode,"" allowing the player full control of the shop (instead of an on-rails approach). There are three types of attacks consisting of the wing blasters, special weapons, and the homing charged shot. The player is able to, while holding the fire button down, lock onto an enemy and unleash a charged laser shot at it to inflict a significant amount of damage. Managing boost is no longer in issue in the final test beta of Star Fox 2, but barrel rolls are still an essential mechanic for deflecting enemy fire.Star Fox 2 adds two new characters, as well as the concept of pilots using different ship types (as opposed to solely Arwings in the first game). Miyu, a lynx, and Fay, a poodle, both join the Star Fox team and both make up the Light Fighter class, which boasts a higher speed stat, but has lower shields and meager fire power. Peppy Hare and Slippy Toad return as the pilots of the Heavy Bomber class, which has the most fire power and the heaviest shields, but is slower and has low maneuverability. Fox McCloud and Falco Lombardi are the pilots of the Arwing Fighter class that is the default average-in-all-areas craft. The Great Fox, a high capacity fighter carrier, houses these ships and has a tremendous amount of firepower, but cannot be piloted by the player.While on a mission in which the player is fighting to liberate a planet, the player may encounter some parts that require the Arwing (or ship of choice) to be transformed into a mech walker. The mech walker is capable of traversing the mission at the player’s own pace and has an aiming assistance feature. </div>  <div> Prerelease Versions : There exist two known prerelease versions of Star Fox 2 in a readily available format. These are both playable in both an emulated format, as well as on actual Super Nintendo hardware.The first prerelease version is an alpha version, known for its two player competitive multiplayer. In the multiplayer mode, both players can choose one of several characters, as well as a level, and then face off.The second and more complete version is considered to be in the late beta stage. It is largely a complete game, containing minor bugs, debug menus, several unfinished features, and the removal of the multiplayer mode found in the alpha version. The game has since been touched up by fans, removing the glitches, debug menus, unfinished features, and translating Japanese text into English, rendering the game completely playable from beginning to end. </div> "

Steel Talons,Panoramic,Left Field Entertainment,November 1993,snes,A combat helicopter arcade game made by Atari in 1991. It has a dual sit-in cabinet that allows for both co-operative and competitive play. It features three missions and one death-match arena.,3030-9506,9506,0,1991-12-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/steel-talons/3030-9506/,," <div> Overview :  The original Steel Talons two player arcade cabinet.Steel Talons is a helicopter combat arcade game released by Atari in 1991. It is a spiritual successor to Battlezone, another vector graphics based war game. The arcade cabinet is a side by side two player cabinet that allowed the player to sit inside while they play to recreate the experience of being inside an actual helicopter cockpit. The game features large open world levels in several different terrains, and the possibility of both co-operative and competitive play with the player on the other side of the cabinet.Steel Talons was ported to the Genesis and Super Nintendo, as well as Atari's home systems the Atari ST, Atari Lynx and Atari Falcon. Each system approached the game's 3D vector polygon graphics differently.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Steel Talons is a helicopter combat simulator where the player is placed into a stage and given an objective to complete. These objectives can be either combat related, such as clearing out all the enemies on the field, to trying to fly through a canyon without crashing into the walls. Almost all levels feature some enemies that the player has to fight, and as the game progresses and the difficulty ramps up, the number of enemies and their aggression ramps up considerably.The player can only take a certain amount of damage before their helicopter explodes, but this does not end the game then and there. Death only depletes the player's fuel supply, which serves as both the unofficial time meter and the player's lives. In earlier levels, the limited amount of enemies gave the player ample time to clear them out before the fuel gauge ran out, but in later levels the player has little room for error before they start running low. The fuel gauge serves as both a time limit for stages, and as a way to get more quarters out of the player, as each additional quarter refuels the helicopter in mid level. Earlier levels feature enemies that are scattered so the player only has to handle one at a time, and they also attack much less frequently and from closer distances. As the difficulty ramps up, enemies are grouped together and attack when they are farther away making them much more challenging to take out. If the player completes a level, their helicopter is repaired for the next. Co-operative play is available if both players start the game and selects the same level at the same time. Co-operative play makes the game significantly easier as players can either attack enemies together drawing fire and sharing the damage, or by heading out separately and clearing out the level in half of the time. A co-op game also helps out players by preventing any game overs as long as one player remains alive. While crashing in single-player forced the player to restart from scratch, as long as one person is left in the stage, the other can start over with a new helicopter and join in again. If two players start at the same time, they can also unlock and select a death-match stage in the game which is dedicated to one on one combat with the other player. Unlike the other stages, this level is much smaller and features a sort of urban environment with large towers for players to hide behind and try to catch their opponent off guard. While unique for the time, the combat is somewhat limited as the players only had two weapons at their disposal, and it often boiled down to who managed to sneak up on the other first. Given the slow moving nature of helicopters, if one player was behind the other, they can often get a missile lock or a good number of bullets into their opponent before they can run away or turn around to fire back.  </div>  <div> Controls : The arcade cabinet for Steel Talons featured somewhat realistic controls for the time. It has three major controls for the player to use all at the same time in order to fly and attack. The first was the joystick that stood front and center in front of the player. The joystick controls the tilt of the helicopter allowing it to move forwards and backwards and strafe from side to side. The joystick features two buttons, a trigger in the front and a thumb button off to the side. The trigger controls the 30mm canon machine guns which have unlimited ammo. There is no cross hair or targeting on the screen, so the computer aims at whatever target it assumes the player is pointing at. This occasionally leaves the player attacking a target they didn't want to whenever enemies become more clustered. The thumb button launches missiles of which the player has a finite supply per stage. Missiles lock on to targets automatically after they came into range for a short period of time and home in once fired. The missiles are very powerful and can usually destroy a target in one hit. Underneath the joystick is a set of foot pedals for the player to rest their feet on. These pedals control rotation of the helicopter allowing players to either maintain altitude and change their position, or the change the angle of their forward momentum. Underneath the seat to the left hand side is the collective. This handle controls the altitude of the helicopter at any given time, allowing the player to rise up beyond the reach of enemy fire, or to hide behind any low cover that is available. The collective has a bright yellow handle that was similar to a rubber bicycle handle. The seat itself is also an integral part of the full body experience. It came with a feature called the ""Rump Thump"" which shakes the seat whenever a player is being hit. This is more than a simple vibration as the Rump Thump feels and sounds violent, as if a hammer is being banged against it, which probably isn't far from the truth of how the device worked. Rump Thump was short lived however, appearing only in Steel Talons and Road Riot 4WD, but it was in many ways a precursor to more modern arcade setups that have similar, more elegant force feedback and speakers in the seats. Players have a heads up display on the screen at all times that gives them information about how much fuel they have left, enemies on the radar, their missile supply, and a small screen that either displays the area map or tells them what they were targeting at that moment. This is particularly useful because the limited vector graphics available at the time left a lot to be desired, and it would look as if the player was targeting grey squares on the ground. This helps create a better picture of what is going on, and also helps the player know if they were shooting at an enemy that can fight back, or simply a building next to it.  </div> "

A Genesis version was developed but cancelled mid-production. A prototype of this Genesis version was eventually leaked to the internet, and was later released by Piko Interactive in 2021 along with a reproduction of the SNES version. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game itself is a side-scrolling brawler.

The player has three attacks: a punch, a kick and a weapon swing. The weapons are different for each character. Holding down one of the three attack buttons also performs a stronger special attack, though it needs a second to charge. The fourth face button allows the character to jump; the weapon swing and kick buttons also perform different attacks in mid-air. </div> "

All the characters were reimagined as various sci-fi fighter game archetypes, with some undergoing more drastic changes than others. The character of Shampoo, for instance, was only given a slight hair color change and a mask and renamed Lita, while Principal Kuno instead became a skateboarding robot named Helmut.Conversely, the second game in the series, Ranma 1/2: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen, was left largely intact with its American incarnation Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle.

Play as one of eight martial artists and travel the world to knock your opponents out of the tournament!",3030-243,243,0,1991-02-06,https://www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter-ii-the-world-warrior/3030-243/,CERO: B," <div> Overview : Ryu and Ken return for more martial arts combat!Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is a 2D fighting game developed and distributed by Capcom for arcades (running CPS-1 hardware) on February 6, 1991.The sequel to the 1987 fighting game Street Fighter, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is credited to laying down the framework for the traditional fighting game genre, as well as kicking off the ""fighting game revolution"" of the 1990s. Along with introducing smoother control over each player's character (as the control in previous fighting games are ""stiff""), Street Fighter II: The World Warrior is the first versus fighting game to allow the player to select his character out of a pre-determined set of fighters, each with their own unique special abilities.Players pick one of eight worldwide warriors (martial artists Ryu and Ken from the previous installment, Japanese sumo wrestler E. Honda, female Chinese martial artist Chun-Li, Brazilian beast man Blanka, Russian professional wrestler Zangief, American former Special Forces operative Guile, and Indian Yoga master Dhalsim) as they travel the world, trying to defeat the other seven warriors and progress through the martial arts tournament.Due to its popularity, the game spawned numerous updates throughout the '90s (starting with Street Fighter II': Champion Edition), enough for it to be considered its own game series. The original game also received ports to certain computer and console system of the early '90s, most notably the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The success of the game also spawned both a Japanese animated film (which later had its own game) and an American live-action film (which later had its own fighting game), two animated series (the Japanese Street Fighter II V and the American Street Fighter), and a Gottlieb-developed pinball adaptation. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ryu (left) getting kicked in the head by Guile (right).In Street Fighter II, players engage in one-on-one martial arts combat (with either computer opponents or other players) with their chosen fighter. Each fighter has their own life bar, which depletes after each successful attack. The winner of the round is decided after either the game's countdown timer expires or one of the fighters is ""knocked out"" (by emptying their life bar).Typically a match is won by winning two out of three rounds, but a Double KO (in which both players are knocked out simultaneously) or a Draw Game (when the game's timer expires and both players having equal vitality remaining) extends the match for another round (while no victor is declared). If the match extends to ten total rounds (four total rounds in the game's updates) and no winner is declared, then both players lose the match.When players are facing off against computer opponents, they must progress through each opponent throughout the game and defeat them. Losing a match allows players to continue, in which players can pick a different fighter (if desired) and restart the fight. If a player manages to defeat all seven opponents, he must face three Grand Masters: American former professional boxer Balrog, Spanish cage fighter Vega, and the master of Muay Thai, Sagat (the final boss from the previous game). It is revealed after defeating Sagat that the player must fight the mysterious dictator M. Bison to win the tournament. Each of the eight playable fighters have unique endings showing the aftermath of their battle with M. Bison.Fights between players and CPU opponents can be interrupted by another player (causing the message ""HERE COMES A NEW CHALLENGER!"" to appear), which triggers a new one-on-one match between the two players in which the winner moves on to fight the current CPU opponent. </div>  <div> Characters : Like the basic version of the original Street Fighter, players have a eight-directional joystick (used for movement) and six buttons in a horizontal rectangular formation (used for attacking). Each of the six buttons corresponds to a different attack type (three ""Punch"" attacks and three ""Kick"" attacks) and strength/speed (two Light attacks, two Medium attacks, and two Heavy attacks). Light attacks are safer to perform (despite dealing less damage) while Heavy attacks deal powerful damage (despite leaving the fighter in a vulnerable state if the attack misses).While walking in one of two directions by holding the joystick in one of two positions (Back for walking away from their opponent and Forward for walking towards their opponent), players can crouch down by holding the joystick in one of the three downward positions (Down, Down-Back, and Down-Forward) and jump up by tapping the joystick in one of the three upward positions (Up for jumping up, Up-Back for jumping away from their opponent, and Up-Forward for jumping towards their opponent). Certain attacks miss when their ducked under or jumped over, while these maneuvers also give new attack options (such as, for crouching players, an anti-air uppercut and a leg sweep capable of knocking down opponents).Players who are hit with multiple attacks in quick succession have a high chance of becoming ""dizzied"". Visualized by a halo of stars around the fighter's head, dizzied opponents are stunned and cannot move or attack until they either receive another hit or ""break out"" of their dizzy state (by tapping multiple buttons and moving the joystick around). </div>  <div> Ports : Using the joystick, players can also perform blocks (known in Japanese version as ""guards"") by holding the joystick in either the Back position (for standing blocks) or Down-Back position (for crouching blocks). Blocked players receive no damage or knockback/knockdown from normal attacks, but are more vulnerable to Grab Attacks (which throw the opponent in a desired direction, damaging them in the process). Grabs are performed by holding either Back or Forward on the joystick (the direction choosing which way to throw the opponent) and pressing Medium Punch or Heavy Punch while the opponent is very close and not jumping.Along with a variety of normal attacks (some of which are different depending on how close the opponent is), each fighter has a set of secret ""special moves"" performed by specific joystick and button combinations. These techniques have special abilities (such as throwing a projectile across the screen or hurling the fighters at their opponents) and can deal more damage (even slightly damaging blocked opponents, later known as ""chip damage""). In some cases, fighters may receive double damage if hit during the execution of a special move. This doesn't apply universally--only some fighters and some moves lead to this vulnerability (Blanka's rolling attack and Sagat's Tiger Uppercut to name a few). This vulnerability made it into the SNES port, but was removed in later revisions of Street Fighter II and their respective home ports.Originally determined as a bug, players can ""cancel"" attack animations into other attacks, allowing players to chain several attacks and special moves into a ""combo"". This technique was soon adapted as a standard feature of the fighting game franchise and was expanded throughout the Street Fighter series. </div> "

Honda's ""Sumo Smash"", Dhalsim's ""Yoga Teleport"", and Chun-Li's ""Kikoken"" projectile). Each character also sports a new default color scheme (with the exception of M. Bison), with their original schemes as alternates.It is the last game in the franchise to be developed on the CPS-1 hardware (before moving on to the CPS-2 hardware, starting with Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers), likely due to the constant flooding of Street Fighter II': Champion Edition bootleg modifications.

This version was digitally re-released for the Virtual Console of both Wii (on June 25, 2007) and Wii U (on August 22, 2013).It was also officially ported to the Sega Genesis (as Street Fighter II' Plus: Champion Edition in Japan and as Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition elsewhere) on September 27, 1993.

Released on October 31, 1998 in North America, December 3, 1998 in Japan, and May 1999 in Europe (by Virgin), this port includes a dedicated Versus and Training Mode, optional arranged soundtracks, and a ""Super Vs.

The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game. </div> "

Stunt Race FX,Nintendo/Argonaut Games,Nintendo,"October 10, 1994",snes,A SNES-exclusive racing game that utilizes the Super FX chip to bring stylized vehicles to life in polygonal 3D.,3030-19991,19991,0,1994-06-04,https://www.giantbomb.com/stunt-race-fx/3030-19991/,," <div> Overview : Stunt Race FX (released as ""Wild Trax"" in Japan) is a 3D racing game developed by Nintendo EAD and released for SNES in 1994. It was developed in collaboration with Argonaut Games, the studio responsible for Nintendo's Super FX chip technology that handles polygonal 3D graphics processing for certain SNES games. Players select among a handful of anthropomorphic vehicles, each with its own unique body style and attributes, before racing against either AI or human competitors in one of several game modes.Similar to Argonaut's previous title Star Fox, Stunt Race FX's use of simple flat shaded polygons to depict objects in three dimensions is extremely rudimentary by modern standards. Stunt Race FX features slightly more detailed environments than Star Fox, but the developers compensated for the increased processing load by lowering the game's frame rate and shrinking the amount of overall screen space devoted to displaying 3D graphics. As a result, only about sixty percent of the game's total screen resolution is used for polygonal rendering. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game's basic controls are similar to other SNES racing titles, particularly Nintendo's own F-Zero. The SNES controller's A button is a brake/reverse gear, the B button is the accelerator and the directional pad moves the car left or right; additionally, the L and R shoulder buttons allow for tighter cornering (also known as drifting) than by simply pressing left or right on the D-pad. Pressing Y activates speed boost, a limited resource which is replenished by collecting blue gem power-ups scattered around the track. The X button causes the vehicle's body to raise up from its wheels and into the air for a moment, effectively giving vehicles the capability to perform small jumps or drive over competitors. Vehicles can also sustain damage, which can be repaired by picking up red gems.Most of the game's racing tracks incorporate significant changes in elevation, presumably to emphasize the 3D capabilities of the Super FX chip over Mode 7-based racing games with completely flat tracks. </div>  <div> Vehicles : The bulk of Stunt Race FX's gameplay is devoted to Grand Prix-style racing series called ""Speed Trax"". Each race in Speed Trax consists of three laps over a single circuit track. There are three Speed Trax Grand Prix series called ""Classes"", each of which contains four circuit tracks. However, players must first complete the Expert Class Grand Prix in order to unlock Master Class tracks.4WD inside Aqua TunnelPlayers are also given a stock of lives to complete a single Grand Prix. If the player exhausts their total reserve of lives, the game ends and the Grand Prix must be restarted from the first race. Players can lose a life by falling off the track, sustaining excessive damage to their vehicle, placing last at the end of a race or allowing the Grand Prix countdown timer displayed in the upper-right corner to reach zero. Additional race time is earned by reaching a track's mid-checkpoint and by completing a full lap. Any extra seconds left on the countdown timer at the end of a race are carried over to the next race in the Grand Prix. Once all four tracks in a Grand Prix have been cleared, the player's final ranking and top three best overall times are displayed.After completing the second race in a Speed Trax Grand Prix, a bonus stage occurs in which players drive the large ""Trailer"" semi truck (viewed from a pulled-back camera angle) through a special course until the course timer reaches zero. Each gate knocked over on the bonus course adds two extra seconds to the player's total remaining Grand Prix time, and each completed lap earns the player an extra life.All twelve courses in Speed Trax can be unlocked for play in Free Trax, the game's time trial mode, once their respective Grand Prix have been cleared. Completing the Master Class Grand Prix also unlocks the 2WD, a narrow vehicle resembling a sports bike, for use in Speed Trax.Novice ClassEasy Ride - A relatively-flat track laid out on a grassy plain with a hairpin turn near the mid-point.Aqua Tunnel - A half-pipe near the beginning of this oceanside course leads into an underwater glass tunnel, where schools of fish and sunken ships can be easily spotted.Sunset Valley - Steep rock cliffs and falling boulders are the main hazards on this straight-but-bumpy track.Night Owl - Several tight turns combined with narrower roads crank up the difficulty in this nighttime metropolitan course.Expert ClassKing's ForestSea BreezeWhite LandNight CruiseMaster ClassLake SideBig RavineSky RampHarbor City </div> "

The revolvers only shoot one bullet at a time, but the bullets fire at a faster rate.Players move on a 2D plane while being able to aim and shoot in eight directions. Some stages have two planes, an upper plane and a lower plane, that they are able to jump back and forth. Most stages pits the players going through a stage battling enemies and course obstacles until the reach the end of the level, where the stage boss awaits. Some bosses have henchmen assisting them, making the boss battle more difficult for the players to contend. Once the boss is defeated, the player is awarded the bounty on the targeted outlaw. If two players are present when the boss is defeated, the bounty is awarded to the player who hit the boss the most.Watch out for that log!There are three stages out of the eight that differ from the other five where the players walk and battle their way to the end boss.Stages 2 & 7: These two stages puts the bounty hunters riding on horses throughout the stage until they reach the boss at the end of the level.

Rather than an action/platformer game, like the rest of the James Pond series, the player takes part in a series of athletic events with an aquatic theme. Players tested their endurance in 100m Splash, the Hop, Skip and Jump, Shell Shooting and many other slightly changed Olympic events.The game was originally released on the Amiga before being ported to the Genesis and Super Nintendo. The SNES version was called The Super Aquatic Games Starring the Aquabats in the US and James Pond's Crazy Sports in Europe. Most versions of the game append ""Starring the Aquabats"" to the title, referring to James Pond's in-game companions (not the real-life band, who are unaffiliated with the game). </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 4,6,5,6 and offered a mixed review, stating that the game would be a good title for younger players, while also saying that the game was ""too difficult"", ""frustrating"" and not, ""...very fun for most players."" </div> "

Players control teams of both cybernetically-enhanced humans and robotic machines as they play a more aggressive game of baseball (filled with new rules and abilities) in the futuristic Cyber Egg Stadium.The game was later released for both the Neo Geo AES (on October 25, 1991) and Neo Geo CD (on February 25, 1995). It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (developed by Monolith and released by K Amusement in Japan and Tradewest in North America) in 1993 and Sega Genesis (developed by NuFX and released by Electronic Arts) on March 1994. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A close play comes under scrutiny.2020 Super Baseball plays like a typical baseball game with some notable tweaks. The game is played using an eight-way joystick and four buttons. The buttons each control basic actions such as when to pitch, when to bat, when to run, and to which base to throw the ball. The stick is used to guide the fielders to the ball, or the runner to the next base.The first thing that changes how this game is played is in the layout of the Cyber Egg Stadium. Areas of the outfield fence are now covered with protective glass, except for the center field, and this glass will bounce the ball back onto the field and into play. The foul zones in the Cyber Egg are reduced to just behind first and third base. Behind first and third base are the Stop Zones, which cause a ball to immediately stop rolling if it touches them. Near the fence there are Jump Zones, where fielders can jump to superhuman heights to catch a ball that would normally go into the stands. Finally, the robotic Umpire will also set the Crackers on the field between innings; these are land mines that will stun a player should they be careless enough to step over them. All of these features in the Cyber Egg Stadium add up to a game that encourages powerful hitting, more bases taken, and a generally more aggressive style of play than traditional baseball.Timeout!Beyond the futuristic new stadium, a powerup system is also available to both the offensive and defensive team. At any time before the ball is pitched, either player can call up a menu of powerups for their pitcher, batter, or fielder. These upgrades come in three progressive strengths. Human players can also be traded for robots which stay more accurate over a longer time on the mound, but can explode and become useless after heavy use. Powerups are paid for with money that is awarded the player for good play, such as hitting the ball and scoring runs. </div> "

The game uses an unusual perspective for its batting/pitching, and employs far more realistic-looking athletes. This is counter to Namco's more famous Super Famista/Super Batter Up, which uses super-deformed characters.Super Bases Loaded was followed by the Japan-exclusive Super Professional Baseball II. The second Super Bases Loaded, Super Bases Loaded 2, is actually a localization of Jaleco's later game Super 3D Baseball. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Super Bases Loaded plays similarly to actual American baseball, and is housed under most of the same rule sets: one team hits while the other fields and pitches; four balls pitched outside the invisible hit-box constitutes a free base, while three suitable pitches results in a strike out. While many advanced rules are also in effect (such as bunt-strike outs) others - balks, infield ""fly-outs,"" foul-pole home runs - are curiously absent. Additionally, players controlling the pitcher can deliberately pitch at players, resulting in neither the batter nor pitcher being penalized beyond an extra base. When players swing, however, their hit-boxes are eliminated, allowing pitchers to throw balls through the batter, and still receive a strike. There is a ten-run mercy rule limit in effect at all times, and a game can only last for up to 23 innings.Each pitcher and batter has a unique stance. Unlike previous entries that largely randomize hits, the game employs a variable physics engine that accounts for timing, bat, and pitch speed, as well as completion of swing, and registered statistics for both the batter and pitcher. Pitchers' speed and accuracy stagnate after every pitch, allowing pitch speeds to range from above 100 mph to below 60. Gravity involving the ball, however, is largely unrealistic, as balls can remain up in the air for periods lasting over 10 seconds. Bunts, especially, can be nearly impossible to execute without being caught. Likewise, lateral ball travel is also markedly sluggish.Baseball can only be played in Bases Loaded Stadium, under the same conditions. The stadium walls are riddled with fake advertisements parodying real-world counterparts. The audience will cheer after every play, with the same enthusiasm, for both teams.The game includes a robust single-player campaign, challenging players to play a ""perfect season,"" or a season composed of eleven perfect games free of runs, hits, and errors. </div>  <div> Roster : Despite the North American release sporting Ryne Sandberg's endorsement, Super Bases Loaded contains a roster of twelve fictional teams, each with fictional players and statistics. Players can also choose to edit a team together (literally as ""Team Edit""). Individual roster statistics can be adjusted to build near-perfect players. </div>  <div> Technical : Runs at 640 x 480 resolution; supports limited Mode-7 3DUp to two players; can play itself automatically be selecting ""Watch"" modeThe soundtrack consists of ten themes, two of which alternate during playThere are five voiced sound clips: ""Strike"", ""Ball"", ""Out"", ""Safe"", and ""Home Run""Wild pitches can occasionally cause an overflow on the catcher's y-coordinate, resulting in his glove phasing through the ground and reappearing above his headPlayers never drop passes from teammates, and every throw is perfectly on-targetSwings can be stopped before completion; check-swings are properly recorded, and there are hidden animations for manipulating the D-Pad while holding the bat outThe pitch speed ranges from 47 to 110 MPH. Neither have even been thrown in an actual MLB gamePitch speed is often inconsistent with the actual speed of the ballThe baseball that enters the screen in the intro can be controlled via controller slot 2There are no transitory animations for catching the ball, which makes it appear to strike the player's backIf a swing is executed after the ball enters the strike-zone, it will not register, and any called ball will not be regarded as a strikeThe home crowd cheers equally for both teamsEach game is capped at 20 inningsA knuckleball can be enabled by quickly cycling the D-PadThe ""infield-fly"" rule is not enforced, meaning fly balls that fails to reach the outfield can be deliberately dropped to create a force out at either third base (if there are runners on first and second base) or home (if the bases are loaded). </div> "

However, it doesn't have the MLB license required for team names, and so the teams are simply referred to by their home town/city/state.

Super Bomberman,Produce,Hudson Soft,September 1993,snes,"Super Bomberman was the first Bomberman game to appear on the SNES, and the first game on that system to feature 4 player simultaneous play via the multitap.",3030-11992,11992,0,1993-04-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-bomberman/3030-11992/,," <div> Overview : Super Bomberman was the first Bomberman game for the SNES. It was created by Hudson Soft in 1993 and has a single- and multi-player mode. The game, like previous titles, is viewed from top-down with the player moving around dropping bombs exploding soft blocks to collect power ups and to destroy the enemy (whether it is a player in multiplayer or monsters in single player mode). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each area fills the screen and is enclosed, so the camera never has to move. The areas typically consist of permanent blocks and destructible blocks, in various colors and styles, with half a dozen standard enemies or a larger boss enemy. The player controls Bomberman, a small character in a white protective suit. He drops bombs at his feet, which pulse for a few seconds and then send flames vertically and horizontally a set number of squares/tiles. The flames destroy the destructible blocks and damage or kill enemies, but they also kill the Bomberman, making tactical placement of bombs very important, especially as bombs cannot be walked over once placed (unless the Bomb Walk power-up is picked up). </div>  <div> Story Mode : An important part of the game is making use of power-ups found after destroying walls or blocks in game. Most power-ups are lost on death in the single-player campaign. Examples are listed below.Extra bombs: Allows the player to have several bombs out at once (rather than waiting for each to explode). Allows for chain reactions.Extra range: Incrementally increases the distance the flames from where the bombs travel, potentially up to the whole width of the area.Maximum range: Gives the full flame range in one power-up.Super bombs: Allows the flame from bombs to pass through destructible blocks as it destroys them.Punch: Allows Bomberman to punch a placed bomb, sending it bouncing over walls into areas otherwise unreachable.Kick: Allows Bomberman to kick a placed bomb, sending it rolling in one direction until it hits a wall.Invincibility: Makes the player invulnerable. Allows a technique of continually dropping bombs into existing flame, creating a constant flame around the player as they walk.Remote bombs: Allows the player to place bombs and then press another button to detonate them, allowing for traps to be laid far easier.Rollerskates: Gives the player increased movement speed.Wall Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through destructible blocks.Bomb Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through bombs that have been placed - reduces chances of being trapped.Time increase: In Story Mode, increases the amount of time the players has to clear any given stage.Extra Life: In Story Mode, grants the player an additional life.There also exists in the game a 'skull' power-up, that has a negative effect when picked up. It essentially prevents the player from planting any bombs for a certain length of time. This is contagious - if the player's Bomberman is touched by an enemy Bomberman who has this effect, they will be affected too. </div>  <div> Multiplayer Versus Mode : Stage 5 of Story ModeThe campaign in Super Bomberman can be played by a single player as just White Bomberman, or co-operatively with 2P as Black Bomberman. Care should be taken as players bombs can kill each other.The story is set in Peace Town located in Diamond City which is Bomberman's hometown. Two villains, Carat Diamond and Dr. Mook, were holding a robot tournament to see which robots were the strongest. They then decided to kidnap Bomberman using a fake Bomberman to steal his technology with the aim of using this knowledge in a robot tournament. Black Bomberman knew what was happening and went on his own to head out and take out this fake robot. He fails and at the same time, his castle was taken from him. Black Bomberman warns White Bomberman of the threat, and together they try and defend Peace Town and defeat the evil robot Bombermen.There are 6 themed worlds consisting of 8 stages and a boss fight. The exit from one stage to the next can be found by destroying the destructible blocks. It can only be entered once all enemies have been defeated. Discovering the exit early on can prove a disadvantage, as hitting it with the flame from a bomb causes more enemies to emerge from it. The 5th stage takes the form of a gladiatorial battle with a series of robot Bombermen who each enter the arena in turn.Each stage features enemies with different abilities. Some examples of this are:Chameleons that change appearance to look exactly like White or Black Bombermen (potentially disastrous in co-op!)Enemies with springs for legs that can pass over walls.Enemies that disappear into tunnels and re-appear in other areas of the stage.Blue ball creatures that are attracted to and eat bombs placed near to them, preventing them from exploding.Tanks that shoot flames in random directions.Enemy bombs that float about and then explode exactly as the player's bombs - damaging each other and the environment.The Story Mode uses a password system rather than writing a saved game file. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : 4 Player game with Punch, Kick and Rollerskate powerups visible.Super Bomberman was the first SNES game to feature 4 player simultaneous play. Since the SNES only featured 2 controller ports, a multitap add-on was needed that plugged into the Player 2 slot, allowing more controllers to be connected. Four players could compete in the Battle Mode, in which each player started in one of the map corners and had to use their bombs to kill each other. There are also environmental threats to consider such as springs that send the player high into the air (see image).Each game has a time limit of 2 minutes, and 1 hit kills each player. The last player standing wins a trophy, and the ultimate winner is decided by a series of games until 1 player wins a predefined number of trophies (1-5). Games are typically very hectic, but in the event of time running out the arena begins to shrink from the outside inward, crushing players who are caught under the falling blocks. If several players are still alive at the end, or if several die at the same time the game is considered a draw and no trophies are awarded. </div> "

It was exclusive to Nintendo Switch Online members and was discontinued on April 1, 2021.Based on the 1985 NES game Super Mario Bros. (and corresponding with the game's 35th anniversary), Super Mario Bros. 35 put players in large-scale 35-player matches where each player simultaneously play through levels from the original game in an attempt to be the last Mario standing. Its premise, along with some of its features, were reminiscent of the studio's earlier game Tetris 99.While most aspects of the game were accurate to the original Super Mario Bros., some changes were made to speed-up the game and introduce player-vs-player features. These include a revamped countdown timer (that counts down throughout the match, rather than by level, and was replenished by performing actions), a new system for acquiring power-ups (randomly, through a ""roulette"" system paid by coins), and ""ghost"" enemies that players sent to others. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game played nearly identical to the original Super Mario Bros., with some differences (such as some glitches being fixed and some changes in game behavior).Rather than a countdown timer for each course, players were given a global countdown timer that ticked down throughout the match. This timer could only be replenished by defeating enemies, clearing stages, collecting duplicate power-ups, and knocking out opponent players. As the match progressed, the timer ticked down at a faster rate.In addition to standard Item Boxes, players earned power-ups by using coins they collected throughout the match to spin the ""Item Roulette"", earning them one of four power-ups at random:Super Mushroom - Transformed the player to Super Mario, if they are normal Mario. Otherwise, it added 15 seconds to the timer. Super Mario gave a one-hit damage buffer (turning them to normal Mario when hit) and allowed players to break bricks from below, at the cost of a larger hitbox.Fire Flower - Transformed the player to Fire Mario, if they were either normal or Super Mario. Otherwise, it added 15 seconds to the timer. Along with the Super Mario benefits, Fire Mario allowed players to shoot fireballs with the Run button.Starman - Gave temporary invincibility, allowing players to defeat most enemies by running into them.POW Block - Cleared all enemies on the screen. Unlike other power-ups, this one were not found in normal Item Blocks.Unlike the original game, players were not scored and could not earn extra Lives. Players were allowed to keep more than 100 coins, and the Extra Life power-up instead gave 20 coins. Each spin of the Item Roulette cost 20 coins. Players had a separate coin counter that persist between matches, which were used to purchase power-ups at the start of each match.By defeating enemies, players sent ""ghost"" copies of those enemies to other players to challenge them. If the opponent was eliminated due to these enemies, the player was notified that they ""knocked out"" that opponent and are granted their coins and added time. Similar to Tetris 99, players chose which opponents to attack both by manual targeting and by one of four targeting strategies:Stronger players with the most coins held.Weaker players with the least time remaining.Players targeting them, as a form of defense.Random players. </div>  <div> Game Modes : The game only included two game modes: 35-Player Battle and Special Battle.35-Player Battle was the game's main mode.

Upgrades to the Hefty Axe which fires slightly upward before moving forward in a wave pattern for greater damage. Lightning Magic fires energy beams outward in eight directions.Crossbow - Fires twin bolts in an up-diagonal trajectory. Upgrades to the Magic Crossbow that fires three homing projectiles. Seek Magic reveals any chests hidden nearby.Torch - Lobs a single torch in a short forward arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Upgrades to the Magic Torch that increases the residual flames' size and damage. Fireball Magic creates three magic spheres that orbit around Arthur, causing damage on contact.Scythe - Fires a scythe straight ahead which can optionally be fired down-diagonally. Upgrades to the Magic Scythe for increased damage. Tornado Magic creates twin tornadoes that swirl around to Arthur's right and left sides.Tri-Blade - Fires a blade that travels in an ""L""-shaped pattern before returning to Arthur's position. Upgrades to the Shuriken for additional damage. Nuclear Magic creates an energy sphere that raises up from Arthur's position before splitting into two horizontal bolts travelling left and right.Goddess' Bracelet - Only available on the second playthrough, this special weapon can be obtained by opening certain chests while wearing the Golden Armor. It fires a large blast of energy straight ahead for a short distance, and its range increases with the Golden Armor equipped.

As the first title in the long-running Mario Kart franchise, it serves as the basic template for all future series entries and popularized the kart racing genre, spawning many imitators with similar aesthetics and gameplay. Players choose from eight Mario-related characters, each with distinct handling characteristics, before racing in one of several competitive modes. Power-up items, a staple feature of the series, typically factor heavily into the outcome of each race.Super Mario Kart is also available as a Virtual Console title through both the Wii Shop and WiiU eShop digital storefronts. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Super Mario Kart's gameplay takes place from a third-person perspective, and its basic controls resemble those of other Mode 7-based SNES racing titles such as F-Zero. The SNES controller's B button accelerates, the Y button is the brake, and the directional pad steers the kart left or right; however, the karts are not equipped with a reverse gear. Pressing the L or R shoulder buttons causes the kart to perform a short hop. While accelerating and holding Left or Right on the D-pad, the shoulder buttons also allow karts to ""power slide"" (or drift) through corners at speed. By pressing and holding the accelerator at the correct moment before the start of a race, the player can perform a rocket start for an initial boost of speed. Players will encounter a variety of built-in track hazards during a race, as well as helpful features like speed boost arrows and ramps.Mario Circuit 1Unlike F-Zero, Super Mario Kart's screen is always split horizontally into two discrete sections during gameplay, allowing two players to compete head-to-head via split-screen multiplayer. For single-player races, the screen's upper section displays a behind-the-back third-person view of the player's kart, while the lower screen section shows each competitor's location on an overhead view of the entire track in real time. Additionally, the X or Select buttons can be used to switch the lower screen section to a rear-view camera mode during single-player races. </div>  <div> Modes : Koopa Beach 1Flat question-mark panels are located in static positions throughout each course. By driving across an active panel, the player will receive a random power-up item selected roulette-style in their inventory window. Players can activate their held item with the A button, and certain items can optionally be thrown behind the player's kart by holding Down on the D-pad while pressing A. The player's likelihood of receiving certain items depends on their current position relative to their competitors; for example, players in last place are much more likely to receive powerful items such as the Lightning Bolt, thereby giving them an increased chance for a recovery in position.Green Shell - A projectile that can either be fired in a straight line forward or dropped into a stationary position behind the player's kart. Green Shells ricochet off of track barriers.Red Shell - A projectile that acts as a homing missile which tracks the closest competitor's kart. Breaks upon contact with any track barrier.Banana Peel - This item is fired straight ahead in a high arc before landing stationary on the track. It can also be deployed directly onto the track behind the player's kart.Feather - Allows the player's kart to perform a super jump, useful for crossing over certain obstacles or utilizing shortcuts.Mushroom - Gives the player a temporary but substantial boost of speed.Star - Grants temporary invincibility, causing other competitors to spin out upon contact with the player's kart. A kart's top speed is increased while invincible, but driving out-of-bounds will prematurely cancel the Star's effects.Lightning Bolt - Shrinks all other drivers on the course for several seconds, significantly reducing the top speed of any affected karts. Shrunken karts can also be squashed by full-sized racers, leading to a time penalty.

It was exclusive to Nintendo Switch Online members and was discontinued on April 1, 2021.Based on the 1985 NES game Super Mario Bros. (and corresponding with the game's 35th anniversary), Super Mario Bros. 35 put players in large-scale 35-player matches where each player simultaneously play through levels from the original game in an attempt to be the last Mario standing. Its premise, along with some of its features, were reminiscent of the studio's earlier game Tetris 99.While most aspects of the game were accurate to the original Super Mario Bros., some changes were made to speed-up the game and introduce player-vs-player features. These include a revamped countdown timer (that counts down throughout the match, rather than by level, and was replenished by performing actions), a new system for acquiring power-ups (randomly, through a ""roulette"" system paid by coins), and ""ghost"" enemies that players sent to others. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game played nearly identical to the original Super Mario Bros., with some differences (such as some glitches being fixed and some changes in game behavior).Rather than a countdown timer for each course, players were given a global countdown timer that ticked down throughout the match. This timer could only be replenished by defeating enemies, clearing stages, collecting duplicate power-ups, and knocking out opponent players. As the match progressed, the timer ticked down at a faster rate.In addition to standard Item Boxes, players earned power-ups by using coins they collected throughout the match to spin the ""Item Roulette"", earning them one of four power-ups at random:Super Mushroom - Transformed the player to Super Mario, if they are normal Mario. Otherwise, it added 15 seconds to the timer. Super Mario gave a one-hit damage buffer (turning them to normal Mario when hit) and allowed players to break bricks from below, at the cost of a larger hitbox.Fire Flower - Transformed the player to Fire Mario, if they were either normal or Super Mario. Otherwise, it added 15 seconds to the timer. Along with the Super Mario benefits, Fire Mario allowed players to shoot fireballs with the Run button.Starman - Gave temporary invincibility, allowing players to defeat most enemies by running into them.POW Block - Cleared all enemies on the screen. Unlike other power-ups, this one were not found in normal Item Blocks.Unlike the original game, players were not scored and could not earn extra Lives. Players were allowed to keep more than 100 coins, and the Extra Life power-up instead gave 20 coins. Each spin of the Item Roulette cost 20 coins. Players had a separate coin counter that persist between matches, which were used to purchase power-ups at the start of each match.By defeating enemies, players sent ""ghost"" copies of those enemies to other players to challenge them. If the opponent was eliminated due to these enemies, the player was notified that they ""knocked out"" that opponent and are granted their coins and added time. Similar to Tetris 99, players chose which opponents to attack both by manual targeting and by one of four targeting strategies:Stronger players with the most coins held.Weaker players with the least time remaining.Players targeting them, as a form of defense.Random players. </div>  <div> Game Modes : The game only included two game modes: 35-Player Battle and Special Battle.35-Player Battle was the game's main mode. Prior to each match, players chose from a list of unlocked courses (1-1 to 8-4, with a total of 36 courses), and all chosen courses are included in that match's course rotation. Players could unlock courses by completing them when others have picked them, or by completing the courses before them. Players also used the mode to earn coins by completing Daily Challenges.Special Battle was a special weekly event from Friday to Monday, featuring a pre-determined course rotation (which is played either in a specific order, or randomized). Many events started the player with a power-up, coins, and/or additional time. </div> "
Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island,Nintendo,Nintendo,"October 4, 1995",snes,"A spin-off of the Super Mario platforming series, Yoshi's Island puts players in control of a tribe of Yoshies as they guide the infant Mario past the forces of the evil Kamek.",3030-2866,2866,0,1995-08-04,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-mario-world-2-yoshis-island/3030-2866/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : The many Yoshis playable in the game, alongside the baby Mario.Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (known in Japan as Super Mario: Yoshi Island) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 1995 (in Japan) and October 1995 (worldwide).A spin-off of the Super Mario series (although its international name refers it to a numbered sequel to Super Mario World), Yoshi's Island diverts from the standard Super Mario platformer formula and puts players in control of one of multiple Yoshies (previously a rideable sidekick in Super Mario World) as they escort the infant Mario to the goal. Along with a new distinct storybook art style and numerous special effects (some of which makes use of the integrated Super FX2 microchip), the game introduces new abilities for the Yoshies (including flutter jumping for extra distance, a mid-air ""ground pound"" technique, and the ability to quickly turn swallowed enemies into eggs for use as ranged weapons).Set on the titular island long before the main Super Mario games, the game's story involves a tribe of Yoshies finding the baby Mario, who fell from the sky from a delivery stork (playing on the childhood fable that storks deliver babies to their parents) after an attempted kidnapping by the evil Magikoopa Kamek. With use of a map that fell with the infant, the Yoshies must navigate their way through the island's 48 levels and the forces of Kamek to deliver Mario to his parents (and, along the way, find his kidnapped twin).Along with multiple follow-ups, the game received a port to the Game Boy Advance in Japan (on September 20, 2002), North America (on September 24, 2002), and Europe (on October 11, 2002). Titled Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island (or, in Japan, Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi Island + Mario Brothers), this version includes some minor changes and additions, as well as the Mario Bros. bonus game from the previous two Super Mario Advance games (with four-player cross-game compatible multiplayer support via link cable).While the game one of the few Nintendo games to not be digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title, it was made available for the Nintendo Switch on September 2019 as a Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online title. It was also included in the Super NES Classic Edition 2017 mini-console. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.Yoshi's Island introduces a plethora of new moves for Yoshi now that he has become the main character. Many of the moves that he has since become known for were first developed in this title, including his ability to hover by kicking his feet furiously for a few seconds. Yoshi's ability to create eggs from enemies and then use them as weapons was also introduced in this title. Throughout his adventures, Yoshi can accumulate up to six eggs that can be used to reach far off switches and collectibles or to simply eliminate enemies. Occasionally, players will have to get keys or other objects that will replace an egg in the line up following YoshiShooting eggs.to unlock or advance in a level. Unlike other Mario titles, Yoshi does not have a finite amount of health (he can be killed instantly by pits, lava, spikes and other such hazards though). Instead, players will have to rescue Baby Mario within a certain time-limit whenever Yoshi is hit. Throughout a level, the timer will refill back to the default 10 seconds, but a player can collect objects, such as bouncing starmen (not to be confused with ones from other Super Mario titles that provide invulnerability), that will increase the limit up to 30 seconds.Hidden throughout each level are a number of extras which players can collect. Part of the challenge of each level includes collecting these items, which are red coins and flowers. Each level has 20 red coins and 5 flowers. Tthe red coins simply serve as a collectible, but the flowers give the player an increased chance of playing a mini-game once they complete the level. If a player collects all of the items in a level and finishes with 30 seconds on their timer, they receive a perfect score of 100 for that level.Some levels require Yoshi to collect a transformation power-up that transforms Yoshi into a vehicle for a limited amount of time. Yoshi can become a helicopter, letting him fly; a car, which increases his speed, but he must avoid enemies; a submarine, which lets him shoot torpedoes that home onto enemies; a train, which rides on rails, but must avoid other enemies also on the tracks; and a mole vehicle that can dig through certain obstacles. During any vehicle segment, players don't have to worry about losing Baby Mario, but still must complete the segment before the transformation wears off. When a player successfully reaches the end of the segment, Yoshi and Baby Mario are reunited and the level continues.On a few rare occasions, Yoshi has a chance to nab a ""super star,"" altering Baby Mario into the 'Super Baby Mario' form, also causing Mario to don a cape. This marks a turn of events for the game where the player controls Baby Mario rather then his scaly chauffer. Baby Mario can run at the speed of light up walls and across ceilings and has an improved ability to jump and glide. Many times, Mario can nab hard-to-reach items and plenty of coins. This power up is seldom seen, and only lasts for a very short period of time, so make good use of it.A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.At the end of each level, players jump through a goal hoop that will randomly reward the player with a mini-game. After that, players are scored out of 100 points depending on how many red coins they collected, how many of the five hidden flowers they found throughout the stage (which will also improve the chance of entering a mini-game) and how much time is left on the countdown timer. After the player receives their score, the Yoshi carrying Baby Mario hands him off to the next Yoshi that will carry Baby Mario through the next level. There six worlds altogether, each of which consists of eight levels that players must clear in order. Players can also unlock hidden bonus stages that add an extra challenge. Players can pick any stage they've previously beaten, in an attempt to get a better score or find any other hidden secrets. Each world has two castle areas where players have to face off against a boss which all have different weaknesses players must discover and are not necessarily as ""generic"" as the bosses seen in other Mario titles that all have similar weaknesses.Yoshi's Island was the first major Mario title that did not contain any form of a warp zone, allowing players to transport themselves further into the game. To complete Yoshi's Island, players were required to complete all of the game's 48 regular stages, though getting 100% completion was a much more daunting task with the many bonus levels featured in the title. </div>  <div> Game Boy Advance version : The extra stages are a series of optional stages that can be accessed if the player reaches a standard of points in specific worlds. Perfect scores are not required, however, the standards are not easy, and so a high score is required for most levels in a world. The extra stages prove to be much more challenging then the main stages throughout the game, only the elite could conquer a few of these stages.These stages are:Extra 1: Poochy aint StupidExtra 2: Hit that switch!!Extra 3: More Monkey MadnessExtra 4: The Impossible? MazeExtra 5: Kamek's RevengeExtra 6: Castles - Masterpiece set </div>  <div> Game Credits : On every level, the player has a chance to play one of many mini-games. Some stages only allow access to mini-games through the end of stage roulette, however, there are special doors on some levels that give accessA bonus challengeto games. Certain levels will have small hut like buildings with locked doors. If the player can locate the key to the door, they can go inside and participate in a mini-game. These mini-games can provide the player with bonuses if they are successful.Throwing Balloons: In this mini-game, Yoshi and the bandit will toss a balloon to each other across the screen. As they toss the balloon, it will continue to grow larger and larger. Once it gets so big that it pops, the character holding it loses.Popping Balloons: popping balloons has Yoshi competing against the bandit to see who can pop the right balloon. The characters run across the small level, ground-pounding all of the balloons. Whoever pops the correct balloon is the winner.Gather Coins: Once again, Yosih is pitted against the bandit. This game has a cannon which moves across the screen, and shooting out coins into the air as it moves. The player must try and collect as many coins as possible. Once the game is over, the character with the most coins wins.Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest: This game puts Yoshi in combat against the bandit, both wielding watermelon seeds. Pots are scattered across the screen, each one with a watermelon in it. The characters collect the watermelons and eat them, then, as if they were a machine gun, spit out the seeds at eachother. Both characters have life, and whoever loses all of their life first is the loser. </div> "
Super Metroid,Nintendo,Nintendo,"April 18, 1994",snes,"Super Metroid is the third game in the Metroid series and the only Metroid game to be released on the Super Nintendo. It has become widely revered for its gameplay, atmosphere, and environmental storytelling, and continues to inspire many action-adventure games.",3030-8292,8292,0,1994-03-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-metroid/3030-8292/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Title screen featuring the Metroid HatchlingSuper Metroid is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo R&D1 and published by Nintendo. It was initially released on the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo) in 1994, but has since then been re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. It is the third game in the Metroid franchise, and the plot picks up where the last game in the series, Metroid II: Return of Samus, left off.Like most games of the series, Super Metroid is an 2D action-adventure game with platforming elements. Players take the role of a female bounty hunter known as Samus Aran as she explores the deadly planet Zebes and collect an arsenal of weapons and gadgets, which will in turn let her progress into areas that were previously inaccessible.Super Metroid was one of the largest and most graphically-impressive games for the console at the time of its release. Even today, the game is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.Super Metroid is also famous for the unintentional ability to ""sequence break"" the game. This means that although there is roughly a set path for Samus to follow, skilled players are capable of reaching ledges or getting past barriers before they have discovered the power up that is ordinarily required to get there. For example, by mastering a maneuver known as the 'mockball' players can get the super missiles very early in the game, when they enter Brinstar for the first time. This curious mechanic has many people struggling to see who can find the fastest path to take to complete the game, making Super Metroid one of the first games surrounded by the 'speedrun' phenomenon. </div>  <div> Story : The famous lineSuper Metroid opens with a short summary of its predecessor, Metroid II: Return of Samus on the Nintendo Game Boy. After she eradicated the Metroids from their homeworld, SR-388, Samus Aran finds a Metroid hatchling, which believed her to be its mother. Unable to end its life, Samus brings the Metroid larvae to the Ceres Space Colony, so that scientists could study the mysterious power of the Metroids.However, just as she leaves, Samus receives a distress signal coming from Ceres. She immediately returns, only to find everyone dead. After a short treck through the Colony Samus encounters her nemesis, Ridley. They have a short battle which ends with Ridley taking the Metroid Hatchling into his possession. She then escapes the space colony as it self-destructs and tracks Ridley to a nearby planet, Zebes.Upon landing on the planet, Samus arrives in Crateria and shortly after arriving finds the morph ball and missiles power ups. Afterwards she collects the morph ball bombs and, before she can exit the room, she is attacked by a Torizo which she defeats. She takes these power ups with her into Brinstar. While in Brinstar she fights the sub-boss Spore Spawn in order to receive super missiles. After visiting Upper Norfair to obtain the Hi-Jump Boots, Samus travels to Kraid's Lair in order to obtain the Varia Suit. After defeating Kraid, Samus receives the Varia Suit allowing her to travel deeper into Norfair.While exploring Norfair Samus finds serveral more power-ups including the Grapple Beam and she defeats the sub-boss Crocomire. After exploring Norfair, Samus uses the Grapple Beam to gain access to the Wrecked Ship. When she arrives the power is off and the place is deserted except for ghosts. Eventually she arrives in a room and the boss Phantoon appears. After defeating Phantoon, power returns to the ship allowing Samus to fully explore it. While exploring the ship she finds the Gravity Suit which will allow her to freely travel through water.Samus then returns to Brinstar and uses a power bomb to break the glass tube separating Brinstar from Maridia. With the Gravity Suit equipped Samus is able to explore the flooded Maridia fully. While in Maridia she defeats the sub-boss Botwoon and the boss Draygon. Upon defeating Draygon Samus receives the Space Jump ability which will allow her access into Lower Norfair where Ridley resides.Shortly after entering lowering Norfair, Samus enters a battle with a Golden Torizo which is much more powerful than the previous Torizo she battled. After defeating it she receives her final power-up, the Screw Attack. After further traveling through Lower Norfair she eventually reaches Ridley's hideout. After defeating Ridley she enters the next room but finds that the Metroid Hatchling is not there.After this she returns to Crateria and enters the room with the four golden statues of the bosses. The gems of the bosses break and the statues collapse granting Samus entrance into the Space Pirates base, Tourian. While traveling through Tourian, Samus reaches an area where the Metroid Hatchling (now fully grown) comes out of nowhere and attacks an enemy. After killing the enemy it proceeds to attack Samus draining all of here energy tanks and leaving her with just one blip of energy.After recovering at a nearby energy machine, Samus eventually confronts Mother Brain who resides in her signature glass tube. Once Samus does enough damage to Mother Brain the tube collapses and Mother Brain reveals her true form. Halfway through the battle Mother Brain begins to drain all of Samus' energy using a beam attack. Before Mother Brain can unleash the killing blow the Metroid Hatchling appears and attacks her. While Mother Brain is stunned from the attacked the Hatchling begins to regenerates Samus' energy. However, Mother Brain recovers from her stunned state and begins to attack the Hatchling while it is in the process of helping Samus. Mother Brain deals a final blow to the Hatchling killing it, but right before it dies it uses the last bit of its strength to give Samus the power of the Phazon Beam which Samus uses to easily finish off Mother Brain.After Mother Brain is defeated a self-destruct sequence is activated and Samus has 3 minutes to get out of Tourian and escape planet Zebes before it explodes. While on her way to her ship she stops to save the animals that helped her earlier in the game. Once she reaches her ship she takes off and while she is flying away Zebes is seen exploding in the background. </div>  <div> Power Ups : Samus' suit can be augmented with a number of power ups that grant her new powers and abilities. Each element can be configured on or off in the suit equipment menu. There are a great deal of power ups to collect scattered throughout Zebes and each one that is collected, along with map squares discovered, increases the completion percentage which is displayed at the end of the game. </div>  <div> Locations : Power UpDescriptionEnergy TankEnergy tanks increase Samus' maximum energy by 100 points. There are a total of 14 energy tanks hidden throughout the game giving Samus a maximum of 1399 energy points (14 tanks plus the initial 99 energy points Samus starts the game with).MissilesMissiles can be used to defeat enemies and open red doors, it takes 5 missiles to open a red door. Each missile tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 46 missile tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 230 missiles.Super MissileSuper missiles are upgraded missiles that are more powerful than standard missiles, but have a slow rate of fire. They can also be used to open green and red doors and it only takes 1 super missile to open either type of door. Each super missile tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 10 super missile tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 50 super missiles.Power BombPower bombs are special bombs that, when laid, create a huge explosion that destroys or greatly damages nearby enemies, and they also have the ability to open yellow doors. Each power bomb tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 10 power bomb tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 50 power bombs.Reserve TankReserve tanks are a rare item that allow Samus to collect extra energy in reserve, each reserve tank can hold 100 energy. When Samus is at max energy, extra energy collected will go to the reserve tanks. If Samus loses all her energy but has energy in her reserve tanks, instead of dieing the reserve tanks will be automatically used giving Samus a second chance. The reserve tanks can also be used manually if the player doesn't want to wait till their energy reaches zero to use them. There are only 4 reserve tanks hidden throughout the game. </div>  <div> Reception : SuitDescriptionVaria SuitThe Varia Suit gives Samus the ability to travel through the super heated areas of Norfair without being damaged. In addition, it also reduces the damage received by Samus. It is received after defeating Kraid in his lair.Gravity SuitThe Gravity Suit gives Samus the ability to travel freely through water-filled areas. It also further reduces the damage received by Samus. It is found in the Wrecked Ship after defeating Phantoon. </div>  <div> Speedrunning : BeamDescriptionCharge BeamThe Charge Beam is the first beam upgrade Samus receives. It allows Samus to charge up her arm cannon to create a powerful charge shot. It is found in Brinstar early on in the game. It can be used with all other beam upgrades except for the hyper beam.Spazer BeamThe Spazer Beam increases the power of Samus' beam and splits it into three horizontal shots giving it a much larger hit box. It can also be combined with the Wave Beam and Ice Beam. The Spazer Beam can be found deep inside Brinstar.Ice BeamThe Ice Beam increases the strength of Samus' beam and gives her the ability to freeze enemies in their tracks, allowing her to use her enemies as platforms. It can be combined with the Spazer Beam and Wave Beam, and it is located in Upper Norfair.Wave BeamThe Wave Beam has the ability to shoot through walls, allowing Samus to access areas that have a switch on the opposite side of a gate. It also increases the power of her beam and can be combined with the Spazer Beam and Ice Beam. It is found in Upper Norfair after collecting the grapple beam. However, it can easily be collected without the grapple beam by wall jumping.Plasma BeamThe Plasma Beam is the second most powerful beam in the game, it produces two horizontal beams when fired. While it has a smaller hit box than the Spazer Beam, it is much more powerful. It can also be combined with the Ice Beam and Wave Beam. It is found in Maridia after Draygon has been defeated.Grapple BeamWhile the Grapple Beam can be used to defeat enemies, its main purpose is to give Samus the ability to grapple onto grapple blocks and swing on them to pass over gaps or to aid in climbing up the side of a wall. It is found in Upper Norfair.Hyper BeamThe Hyper Beam is the final beam received in the game and is the most powerful beam. It fires a single beam of incredible power, capable of destroying normal enemies with a single hit. It is received in the middle of the final boss fight with Mother Brain. After the Metroid Hatchling is killed by Mother Brain, it gives Samus the Hyper Beam before dying.Murder BeamThe Murder Beam is an unofficial beam that can be obtained via a glitch in the game. It is obtained by equipping all five beams at once (usually the Plasma Beam and Spazer Beam can not be equipped together). In order to equip all five beams the player must first charge their beam, while the beam is charged they should go into the menu and equip all five beams. When fired, the Murder Beam produces an invisible wall of broken pixels rather than a sprite and the color is random. It is usually used during the Mother Brain fight as it is capable of killing her very quickly. Another interesting note is that the beam can only be fired to the left, if fired to the right the game will crash.Space/Time BeamThe Space/Time Beam is another unofficial beam that can be obtained using a glitch. Instead of equipping all five beams at once, equipping the Spazer Beam, Plasma Beam, and Ice Beam together will produce the Space/Time Beam (Charge Beam can also be equipped though it is optional). The beam causes heavy lag and is registered as morph ball bomb damage when shot at enemies. The beam is best known for its ability to permanently corrupt the game, make strange alterations to the graphics, and produce several glitches such as resetting item pick-ups. </div>  <div> Glitches : AbilityDescriptionMorph BallThe Morph Ball gives Samus the ability to curl up into a ball in order to roll through small spaces. It is found in Crateria towards the beginning of the game.Morph Ball BombsThe Morph Ball Bombs give Samus the ability to lay bombs while in morph ball mode. While the bombs can be used to damage enemies, they are mostly used to bomb jump up to higher platforms while in morph ball mode. It is also possible to bomb jump infinitely, however this technique is very hard to do and is usually only used by expert speedrunners. The Morph Ball Bombs are found shortly after the morph ball in Crateria.Hi-Jump BootsThe Hi-Jump Boots increase the height of Samus' jump, allowing her to reach platforms that were previously unreachable. The Hi-Jump Boots are found shortly after entering Upper Norfair.Speed BoosterThe Speed Booster give Samus the ability to run incredible speeds destroying enemies and speed booster blocks in her path. The Speed Booser has a charge up time requiring to dash for a short amount of time before the speed booster kicks in. This charge up time can be shortened using the ""short charge"" technique. This technique allows speedrunners to sequence break past certain areas of the game. For example, this technique allows players to reach the wrecked ship without the grapple beam. The Speed Booster is found in Upper Norfair after defeating Kraid to obtain the Varia Suit.X-Ray VisorThe X-Ray Visor can be used by Samus to view breakable blocks. It is widely consider to be an unnecessary item because morph ball bombs can be used to reveal breakable blocks and players can often figure out what blocks are breakable by hints in the graphics. The X-Ray Visor can by found in Brinstar after collecting the grapple beam. However, it can also be collected without collecting the grapple beam, by strategically freezing enemies with the ice beam and using them as platforms.Space JumpThe Space Jump allows Samus to infinitely spin jump in the air giving her the ability to reach any height. The Space Jump can be found in Maridia right after defeating Draygon.Spring BallThe Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while in morph ball form negating the need to use bomb jumping. The power up is useful for players who struggle with bomb jumping, but rather useless to masters of bomb jumping. The Spring Ball can be found in Maridia.Screw AttackThe Screw Attack is the final power up found in Super Metroid. It adds a lighting attack to Samus' space jump destroying any enemy that comes in contact with it and also destroying breakable blocks. It is found in Lower Norfair after defeating the Golden Torizo. </div>  <div> ROM Hacks : LocationDescriptionCeres Space ColonySuper Metroid begins when Samus receives a distress signal from this research station shortly after delivering the Metroid hatchling to the scientists there. Her visit is brief as her nemesis Ridley sets off the self-destruct sequence as she exits with the metroid hatchling in hand.Planet ZebesThe majority of the game takes place on Zebes, the same planet Samus visited in the original Metroid title, as well as her former home when she was being raised and trained by the Chozo. Zebes contains a variety of environments that Samus explores as she tracks down the stolen Metroid hatchling.CrateriaCrateria is the area Samus lands in when she arrives on Zebes. Not much time is spent here, as it is more of a route to the deeper locales Samus explores. The atmosphere here is dreary and ominously quiet for the duration of her visit, either raining or cloudy most of the time. Crateria also houses the ruins of Mother Brain's original hideout, Tourian, which self-destructed at the end of Samus first mission to Zebes. Samus finds the Morph Ball Bombs here.BrinstarThe starting point of the original Metroid title, Brinstar houses 5 unique environments: a blue-hued environment where the Morph Ball is obtained; a lush, green, jungle-like environment; a pink, plant-filled environment where the Charge Beam resides; an area consisting of red-colored soil where Samus finds the Spazer Beam and X-Ray Scope; and a combination of green plants and metallic structures where Samus battles the gigantic reptilian-like creature Kraid in his lair to obtain the Varia Suit.NorfairThe fiery Norfair leads Samus the areas closest to the planet's core, which include caves composed of what seems like cooled igneous rock, deeper caves filled with treacherous lava pits, a small area filled with hardened green bubbles of some sort, and ancient Chozo Ruins that Ridley has claimed as his hideout. Samus can find many power-ups here, such as the Hi-Jump Boots, Speed Booster, Ice Beam, Grapple Beam, Wave Beam, and Screw Attack.Wrecked ShipThe Wrecked Ship consists of the haunted ruins of a crashed space vessel (presumably the destroyed Space Pirate mother ship from the conclusion of Metroid: Zero Mission). Samus must defeat the powerful ghost Phantoon here to restore power to the ship and obtain the Gravity Suit.MaridiaThe eerie aquatic environment of planet Zebes, Maridia, is filled with a number of marine-based areas such as water-filled chasms; damp, sand-filled rooms and a flooded metallic area presided over by intimidating crustacean, Draygon. Samus finds the Space Jump, Spring Ball, and Plasma Beam power ups here.TourianAfter conquering every dangerous corner of planet Zebes, Samus comes to find out that the Mother Brain's base of operations, Tourian, has been relocated and rebuilt and is once again filled with the energy-siphoning Metroids. If Samus can trek through the deathly corridors and defeat Mother Brain once and for all, she can finally bring closure to her once beloved home of Planet Zebes that the greedy Space Pirates invaded so long ago. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Super Metroid has received universal acclaim from critics. On Gamerankings the game holds an average review score of 95.79%, making it the highest rated SNES game on the site. </div> "

Super Punch-Out!!,Nintendo,Nintendo,"September 14, 1994",snes,"The second home adaptation of Nintendo's Punch-Out!! series of boxing arcade games, pitting players against sixteen pugilists from around the world (each with their own variety of techniques, a lot of which are illegal).",3030-6029,6029,0,1994-09-14,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-punch-out/3030-6029/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Super Punch-Out!! (not to be confused with the 1984 arcade game of the same name) is a behind-the-back boxing game developed by Nintendo R&D3 and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America on September 14, 1994 and in Europe on January 26, 1995. It received a limited release in Japan on March 1, 1998 as part of the Nintendo Power service.The second home adaptation of the 1983 arcade game Punch-Out!! (and its sequel), after the NES adaptation, Super Punch-Out!! follows a young up-and-coming boxer as he fights his way up the ranks of the World Video Boxing Association (or W.V.B.A.) through boxing matches against numerous colorful opponents from around the world (most of which specialize in illegal boxing tactics, such as overhead strikes, grappling, and kung fu kicks).Unlike the NES adaptation, this adaptation is more faithful to the arcade originals in both appearance and gameplay. This includes the return of the Power Meter (replacing the Star system), two forms of guarding (upper and lower), and the removal of the Heart gauge (with stun state now determined by the character's portrait background color). It features a leaderboard system (with per-opponent ""fast time"" and per-circuit ""high score"" records), a save file system (allowing players to return to the game without passwords), and a Time Attack mode (allowing players to fight a single opponent). It also features Charles Martinet's first voice acting on an official Nintendo game.The game was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (in 2009), Wii U (in 2014), and New Nintendo 3DS (in 2016). It was also included in the Super NES Classic Edition micro-console and as part of the Nintendo Switch Online - Super Nintendo Entertainment System service for the Nintendo Switch (on December 12, 2019 in North America and Europe and on May 20, 2020 in Japan).The game was also included as a bonus for the GameCube version of the 2005 EA game Fight Night Round 2 to make up for that version's lack of online play (with Little Mac available as an unlockable). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Super Punch-Out!! has similar gameplay to the original. The player faces a single opponent, and is able to sway left and right, and execute both right and left punches to the body and head. From there, however, there are several subtleties to the gameplay that make Super Punch Out!! a much deeper experience than the original. </div>  <div> Circuits : The four normal punches players can throw vary in speed and strength. There is an inverse relationship of how fast a punch is to how powerful it is. From quickest and weakest to slowest and most powerful, the order of the punches is as follows: Left Jab, Left Body, Right Jab, Right Body. Mixing the punches up accordingly may yield extra hits or extra damage, so finding the proper mix of punches can yield quicker K.O. times for time trials.As in the original Punch Out!!, they player can throw a powerful uppercut, but instead of stars, this time there's a meter that fills up as they fight. This meter does not deplete as players use it. Instead, getting hit by an opponent depletes the meter. (The amount is based on the damage of the punch.) The uppercut, furthermore, is simply one of four available ""special"" punches. Players can also deal a vicious hook to the body, and rapid punches to both the head and body. The difference between the head and body special blows is the speed and power with which the blows connect, with shots to the head being slightly quicker and less powerful and shots to the body being slightly slower and more powerful. </div> "

Smash TV retains this same gameplay, using the left joystick to move and the right to shoot, allowing a player to move in one direction while firing in another.Evil M.C.The year is 1999. A new game show called Smash TV was created which puts its contenders to the fight for their lives. They will have to kill hundreds of enemies and collect money and prizes (from toasters to a big-screen TV). The inspiration for Smash TV seems to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, The Running Man. Two players can play simultaneously, and at the end of each of the three levels, the two players' performance is compared, with one being declared the winner.Each level ends with a boss battle. The first level pits the players against Mutoid Man. The second boss is a giant, round face named Scarface. The third level seemingly ends with a fight against two large, robotic snake heads called Die Cobros. But this is immediately followed by the game's true boss, the game show host himself called Evil M.C. This battle is essentially a tougher version of the Mutoid Man boss fight. </div>  <div> Home Versions : Super Smash TV for the SNES After its success in coin-operated form, Smash TV was brought to the home market on many different console and computer platforms. Home game consoles of the era were not equipped with multi-joystick controllers; alternative control schemes were implemented to approximate the controls of the arcade original. While some versions use buttons to fire in a direction, or to toggle a direction, others use multiple controllers' joysticks. Acclaim's SNES version of the game, Super Smash TV (referred to by its original name within the game), used the D-pad and face buttons to duplicate the two joysticks of the original. The SNES version also contains additional secret rooms.The Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is an emulation of the original arcade release, controls with its two joysticks. It is also the only version to include online play, letting two players play the game over the Internet.This game is featured on Midway Arcade Treasures for the Gamecube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC. </div>  <div> Achievements : Due to a glitch in the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, 360 users are unable to obtain the full 200 achievement points available in the game. The Game Master Achievement (in theory obtained by beating the game without continuing on default systems) does not unlock, denying gamers the game's final 50 points. The publishers have acknowledged the problem, but there are currently no plans to fix the issue. </div>  <div> Sequels : Though Smash TV never received a proper sequel, many of the same people responsible for the game went on to produce Total Carnage, a game that maintained the same control style and applied it to a vertical scrolling world, similar to Ikari Warriors or Mercs.

It premiered in its native Europe first before being released in North America later the same year.Super Turrican 2 was published on the Wii's Virtual Console in North America in 2008, but has since been removed from the service.   </div> "

Valis IV,Telenet Japan,Atlus,February 1993,snes,"Chronologically the final game in the side-scrolling Valis series. Unlike its predecessors, Yuko is not the main character. It is also the only game to be ported to a Nintendo system.",3030-442,442,0,1991-08-23,https://www.giantbomb.com/valis-iv/3030-442/,," <div> Overview : Valis IV is the last game in the Valis series. Like the earlier games, it was released on multiple platforms, and as was also the case in the past the games have sizable differences depending on the platform. It was released on both the PC Engine and Super Famicom/SNES.As usual, the basic story is the same in all of the versions of the game. This time, the Red Moon has risen in the sky signifying the return of King Galgia, a terrifying fiend imprisoned long ago on Vecanti. He quickly decimates and conquers Vecanti and has set his sights on the world of humans, Earth. Lena Bland sets out on a journey to obtain the Valis Sword and defeat Galgia. </div>  <div> Characters : Lena Bland:The game's protagonist. A member of the resistance against Galgia, she is brave and strong. She uses a sword, and eventually (of course) the Valis sword. 16 years old. She is playable in both versions (and is in fact the only playable character in the SFC/SNES version) Am: Another member of the resistance, she is Lena's younger sister. She is a bit of a slacker and somewhat goofy, but she can be counted on to help her sister. She wields a bird-shaped boomerang fired from a rod and can double jump. 14 years old. She is not playable in the SFC version, but is implicitly there as her grave is seen. So you're saying I was a deadbeat dad?Asfar:Actually Galgia's father, and a former king. While no saint, he is not actually evil. He joins and fights alongside Lena and Am to stop his son's reign of terror and to come to terms with the fact he was a bad father. He is not present in the SFC version of the game. He wields a staff which fires wolf-heads made of energy, and because he's such a tough guy, he takes no damage from spikes. Cham: Returning from Valis III, she is now the leader of Vecanti. The monsters are on good terms with the humanoids since the death of Grames, the previous king of the monsters. She is also the leader of the resistance against King Galgia. Valna:Yuko's sister also returns. She has been kidnapped and imprisoned by Galgia. Yuko:The heroine of all the previous Valis games, Yuko Aaso is now a goddess who protects the Sword of Valis. Will she judge Lena worthy of becoming the next Phantasm Soldier? General Dhalgen:The first of King Galgia's generals, he dominates Vecanti from Vanity Castle. He is the torso of a man growing out of the back of a tiger, an obvious homage to ""Duke Gorgon"" of Mazinger fame. In both games, he is capable of jumping around the room, firing a large crescent projectile from his sword that pushes the opponent away and damages them, and spitting fireballs from his tiger head. General Medius:The second of Galgia's generals, and the only female general. In the PCE version, she challenges Lena inside of Crystal Pillar. In the SFC version, she is in control of Valhalla. General Luzard:The last of Galgia's three generals, his speciality is the ""jet steam crush"". In the PCE version he is guarding Valna on top of Crysal Pillar, while in the SFC version he challenges Lena on the surface of Red Moon. Galgia, King of the Red Moon:The game's primary antagonist. Imprisoned long ago by the Gods of Vecanti, he now possesses the Titan Ring, an item that gives him almost insurmountable power. He hates his father and was jealous of his father's power when younger. He is responsible for the death of Am, as she takes an attack intended for Valna. In both versions of the game he is fought in the core of Red Moon, although he has multiple forms in the PCE version. He challenges his father in his normal form, then he fights Lena in a powered-up form and eventually turns in to a giant disembodied head and set of hands which are fought in a field of stars. In the SFC version, he simply remains in his normal form (although he does fire some bullets at Lena from the comfort of his throne before actually attacking!) </div>  <div> The Super Famicom/SNES version : In the SFC version of the game, only Lena Bland is playable. She is capable of several basic actions, including running, jumping, and attacking. She can also shoot magic bullets (the player holds ""up"" and attacks to fire these.) There are a number of items in this game. Up to six can be held in reserves; if another item is picked up, it replaces the item furthest to the left of the item bar and moves all the remaining items to the left by one space, appearing on the far right. At the end of the game, Yuko appears to judge the player's performance based on a variety of criteria. </div>  <div> The PC Engine version : Heart: A single use item. This heals some lost energy when used.Armor: A single use item. When this is used, Lena transforms and wears Valis armor. This makes her immune to damage for five hits, after which she returns to normal.Three way: This item replaces Lena's basic magic bullet when used. This allows Lena to shoot three beams up at various angles by perform the normal motion for the magic bullet. This item can be used 20 times before it wears off.Bomber: This item replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Bomber shoots a powerful blast straight forward. This item can be used 10 times before wearing off.Search: This item also replaces Lena's magic bullet when used. Re-using the ""wolf head"" sprites of Asfar's attack from the PCE version, Lena fires wolf-heads that follow the terrain (they move up hills, etc.) This item can be used 20 times before expiring.Homing: Again, this replaces Lena's basic magic bullet. Lena fires flaming dragons that home in on enemies. This item can be used 20 times before expiring. </div>  <div> Secrets : The DS-30 custom!The SFC/SNES version of the game has seven stages, or ""acts"".Stage 1: VecantiVecanti is in ruination from Galgia's overwhelming attacks. The boss of this stage is DS-30kai. It is also a boss in the PCE version, although of a much later stage, and its actions are completely different. The enemies in this stage are: deadhead, flying shears, and lance guarder.Stage 2: Vanity CastleOnce the seat of Queen Valia's power, it has a tendency to be taken over by villains. Currently it is occupied by General Dhalgen. The enemies in this stage are: dead head, lance guarder G, and spectre.Stage 3: BabylonWater and ruins abound on Lena's journey to see Yuko. The boss of this stage is Nornil, a shape-shifting statue with three forms (a statue, a harpy, and a mermaid.) This boss is unique to the SFC version of the game, although the harpy sprite is also used in the PCE version for a different boss. The enemies in this stage are: okimono, lash, and technical monkey.Stage 4: ValhallaYuko's dominion. General Medius is in control of this area in the SFC version. In this game, Medius attacks by creating multiple fake images of herself and diving rapidly at Lena. Occasionally she drops to the platform to fire a large orange projectile or two at Lena. The enemies in this stage are: seraph, death flower, high priestess, siren, and arch elf.Stage 5: Crystal PillarFormerly King Galgia's prison, it is now his base of operations on Earth. The boss of this stage is the core of Crystal Pillar, and is unique to the SFC version. It is protected by ""Final Guarder"", which is also an enemy from the PCE version's final stage. This version of ""Final Guarder"" is invincible, the core must be targeted. The enemies in this stage are: sword guarder, tower grey, disc guarder.Look out, it's the Jet Stream Crush! Stage 6: The surface of Red MoonFloating foetuses and strange copies of Lena abound. General Luzard challenges Lena at the end of this stage. He floats around shooting lasers out of the eyes on his chest at Lena, switching sides periodically. He then performs his ""jet stream crush"", moving back and forth quickly from one edge of the screen to the other, gaining speed each time.The enemies in this stage are: redmoon meteor, beyond, beyond Lena, and okimono.Stage 7: Red Moon's coreGiant pulsating spheres and re-used music from Babylon signal that Lena's journey is coming to an end. Galgia's three generals are fought again, afterwhich King Galgia himself challenges Lena to a final duel. There are no regular enemies present in this stage. Galgia has a large number of projectile attacks at his disposal. He ""blocks"" attacks with his halberd and cannot be hit unless he stops blocking (he is also vulnerable when jumping.) When his life has been reduced by a certain amount, he fires various patterns of green foetus bubbles at Lena which restore his health by a fairly large margin should they make contact.The ranking system. After the game is completed, Yuko judges the player's skill based on a variety of factors: The number of items picked up and the speed at which the game was completed are primary. If the player died at all, they will not get a good ranking. Lower rankings result in bizarre things happening to Lena, such as her exploding or falling off of the bottom of the screen.  </div> "

Syndicate,Bullfrog Productions,Ocean Software,December 1995,snes,"Syndicate is a reinvention of the 1993 game by Bullfrog. Developed at Starbreeze Studios, the game puts players in the shoes of Miles Kilo, one of the cybernetically-enhanced Agents who wages war against enemy mega-corporations on behalf of EuroCorp, his sponsor syndicate.",3030-30734,30734,0,2012-02-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/syndicate/3030-30734/,PEGI: 18+," <div> Overview : Developed by Starbreeze and published by EA, Syndicate is a fast-paced first-person shooter, taking place in the same dystopian cyberpunk future originally conceived by Bullfrog in their 1993 isometric real-time tactical game by the same name. Set in 2069 (as opposed to the 2096 of the Bullfrog release), the campaign is seen through the eyes of Miles Kilo.Despite favourable reviews, EA announced that Syndicate had failed to meet expectations commercially and did not turn a profit. </div>  <div> Story : Syndicate takes place in a future where corporations (also referred to as Syndicates) have grown tremendously powerful, replacing the governments of the world. They lean heavily on advancing the capabilities of the DART chip, a microchip implanted in the skull of 57% of the world population that allows enhanced interactivity with the surrounding world. Each corporation has weaponized the chip, allowing for enhanced senses and physical abilities, as well as the ability to hack in to other chips to varying degrees with diverse effects.Drawl, Merit and Denham talking serious businessExperimental versions of these chips are placed in 'Agents', assets utilized by the corporations to further their agendas through a mix of subterfuge, sabotage and aggression. With each company trying to gain the upper hand over their competition, corporate espionage runs rampant, paranoia is innate, and tensions have reached a boiling point between the three largest Syndicates of the world: EuroCorp, Aspari, and Cayman Global.The campaign follows the story of Agent Miles Kilo, primary test subject for Dr. Lily Drawl's (voiced by Rosario Dawson) prototype DART-6 chip, his partner Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), CEO of EuroCorp Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox), and the fall of EuroCorp. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Syndicate's gameplay focuses on combining shooting and melee executions with skillful use of the DART chip's abilities. The single player campaign and the multiplayer co-operative mode share many fundamentals, but end up playing fairly differently. In both modes, your use of applications are limited by your ability to produce adrenaline. Scoring and chaining together kills, completing objectives and performing ""breach spikes"", essentially an active reload, will all produce adrenaline, recharging your applications.The DART Overlay in actionThe campaign provides access to four key abilities:DART Overlay: Slows down time and highlights targets in the environment, even behind cover. With upgrades, it can mitigate damage, increase health regeneration, and increase damage output.Backfire App: This application causes the gun of an enemy to misfire, initially affecting two targets, but can be upgraded to three. Those effected suffer a small amount of damage from the initial blast and are susceptible to increase damage.Suicide App: This application disrupts DART chips' regular functions, causing the effected target to pull out a grenade and commit suicide.Persuade App: A throwback of sorts to the original Syndicate, this application causes a target to switch sides and fight alongside you. In the event that all enemies are eliminated, the target will turn the gun on themselves.The ability to ""breach"", or hack, in to enemy chips and the environment around you plays an integral part in gameplay as well. Several enemies will sport armor types that negate all damage until they are hacked, and often times progress through a level will be hindered until a computer terminal, control switch, etc. is hacked to open up the pathway.The game also consists of a four player cooperative mode that follows the loose story of up and coming Syndicate, Wulf Western and it's agents: Akuma, Thalos, Fall and Darius. Players are able to create different loadouts, making weapon and application combinations that all them to potentially fill a team archetype, e.g. Tank, Healer, etc. Because the multiplayer is not competitive based, there is no Online Pass required by EA to access the multiplayer content. </div>  <div> Co-operative Mechanics : The co-operative mode in Syndicate is designed for 4 players but skilled players can tackle the missions solo or in pairs and still have great success in earning experience. Any experience earned will be lost if a player does not finish a given mission so be sure to keep that in mind if you need to leave a game in progress. The experience earned goes towards player rank, weapon upgrades and application research. Each rank provides points which can be spent in a skill tree to increase the attributes of the player, such as faster breach speed, increased health, the ability to equip two applications at once and even temporary invulnerability when near death.Each mission can be played on one of three difficulties: Normal, Hard and Expert with each jump providing stronger enemy types and more of them to deal with. Usually this includes more of the armored enemies that usually require focused teamwork to take down. During the higher difficulties it will be more likely that a player is put into a downed state and thus will need a ""reboot"". During the initial downed phase a player may move around, albeit very slowly, and attempt to get close to an active player to be ""rebooted"". If any more damage is sustained the player will drop to their knees and a longer reboot will be needed.Two main types of mission objectives are employed in co-op. One will require you to perform combat sweeps of a given area / facility and eliminate any hostiles found within. The second will task you with retrieving items of value / interest and delivering them safely to a waiting dropship.After a mission is beaten on a specific difficulty the player will earn application research tokens which allow for the improvement of the abilities that can be equipped before entering a mission. Each application can be improved 4 times from the base effect. The player can choose which upgrade will receive priority if mulitple research projects are unlocked and a single project can be queued to earn experience after the main designation is complete. If the designated and queued research finish during a mission then any further unlocked projects will receive research in a sequential fashion until a priority is chosen by the player.The armored enemies carry powerful weapons and are immune to most forms of damage until their armor is breached or bypassed by the player agents. Once a breach occurs a layer of the armor is weakened and the players have a set amount of time to destroy it and damage the health of the enemy. The strongest type of enemy has 3 layers to breach and on the third breach they are disabled allowing the players to remove their chips.Agent Fall getting his chip rip onRemoving a chip from a downed elite soldier will unlock blueprint tokens that will allow players to unlock upgrade paths for weapons and start to designate earned experience towards unlocking the upgrades. Experience continues to accrue towards ranks but now also goes towards unlocking scopes, silencers and other upgrades for each weapon in the game. This research can be designated and queued in an identical fashion to application research.The player can edit and save 3 distinct loadouts consisting of a main weapon, sidearm and one (or two) applications. The weapons available are of a limited selection and many must be found within missions. Any upgrades applied to these retrieved weapons will apply upon picking them up during the mission. The dropped weapons can include a Thermite gun ( flamethrower ), Rocket launcher, Minigun and more. The more powerful weapons can not be refilled at the ammo crates that dot the mission layout.The applications that can be taken into the co-op mode are generally unique to the co-op apart from Backfire, which appears in the main campaign. There are 12 applications in total:Backfire: Hacks enemy weapons and makes their ammo explode, forcing them to the ground and making them more vulnerable to damage for a time.Focus Target: Highlights a target and increases damage done on the hacked target by a given amount.Battery: Recharges fellow agents applications a given amount but can not be used to refill another application of Battery.Focus Breach: Decreases breach time for all fellow agents.E-Drain: Damages enemies and converts that damage into health for the player.C2C Pulse: Healing waves pulse from the player, healing anyone near to them by a given amount.Reboot: Allows a player to revive themselves from a downed state.Damage Link: Increases weapon damage of all players for a time.Shielding: Provides a temporary shield to all players that absorbs a set amount of damage.EMP: Releases an EMP charge around the player that can stun enemies and disable turrets and UAVs.Squad Heal: Heals all players by a set amount.Virus: Infects enemies with a damage over time effect that can even penetrate armored enemies without breaching first.Before entering any mission a player may form or join a player created Syndicate. This is the clan system of the game and brings bonuses to the player in the form of increased experience from healing and rebooting fellow Syndicate members during missions.The game ships with 9 maps, that are billed as ""reimaginings"" of some the original Syndicate's mission: Western Europe, Mozambique, Atlantic Accelerator, Colorado, China, Scandinavia, Northern Territories, Argentina and New England. </div>  <div> Development : EA's Jeff Gamon has stated that,""Fans of the franchise will recognize many weapons and environments in the game, but in a whole new way. The game also provides a separate and deep 4-player co-op mode featuring missions from the original cult classic, which adds another layer of depth to the overall experience."" </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : HardwareMinimumRecommendedProcessorIntel Core 2 Duo (E4600) at 2.4 Ghz or equivalent (Athlon 64 X2) processorCore 2 Quad Q6400 2.13GHz or Athlon II X3 440Video CardATI Radeon HD 4650 or NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (min. 512mb RAM) or betterGeForce GT 545 DDR5 or Radeon HD 4850OSWindows XP with SP2, Windows Vista, Windows 7Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7HDD10.5 GB12 GBMemory2 GB Windows 7 & Windows XP (3 GB with Windows Vista)4 GB </div>  <div> External links : Official websiteSyndicate Wiki </div> "

The player calls all of the plays, changing defensive formations and offensive line-ups to match the opponents' moves.The game also features player injuries. Occasionally, a player will be injured, and will have to sit out a game or two. While the game does not have any method of classifying the injuries, or how long they will affect the player, it was still a step towards the more realistic football simulations of the present day. </div> "

Tetris Attack,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"August 4, 1996",snes,"One of the progenitors of the ""swap and match"" tile-based action-puzzle games, featuring either a Yoshi theme (for its international ""Tetris Attack"" release) or a cutesy fairy theme (for its Japanese ""Panel de Pon"" release).",3030-13130,13130,0,1995-10-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-attack/3030-13130/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : The original Japanese version of the game, known as ""Panel de Pon"", features an original cutesy world inhabited by fairies.Tetris Attack (known in Japan as Panel de Pon) is a 2D tile-matching puzzle game developed by Intelligent Systems (in conjunction with Nintendo's R&D1 team) and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan (on October 27, 1995), North America (on August 1996) and Europe (on November 28, 1996).Although its international name shares the same name as the Tetris series, this game bares no resemblance to other Tetris games and instead uses a new original gameplay style of manipulating an evolving playfield using a horizontal two-tile cursor.Unlike most tile-matching games of the era (where players must manipulate the placement of new groups of tiles), Tetris Attack has players swapping tiles already on the playfield (allowing them to form their own chains of tile matches, similar to the Columns and Puyo Puyo series).Both Japanese and international versions of the game differ in theme, with the international version using characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (in similar fashion to Kirby's Avalanche) and a new original soundtrack. The Japanese version takes place in the fantasy world of Popples, where the fairy protagonist Lip must defeat her fairy friends to stop them from fighting (due to a spell by the devil king Sanatos).The game received a handheld port for the Game Boy, with all versions using the Yoshi theme. While it was released at the same time as the console version in North America and Europe, it was released on October 26, 1996 in Japan (as Yoshi no Panepon). The original game also received two limited releases on the Japan-exclusive Satellaview service: BS Yoshi no Panepon (which was released in November 1996 and uses the Yoshi theme) and Panel de Pon Event '98 (which was released in December 1997 and uses the original theme).The game later received multiple sequels under the ""Puzzle League"" name, none of which use the Yoshi theme. A sequel to the original Super Famicom release, Panel de Pon 64, was nearly finished before being cancelled and reworked into Pokémon Puzzle League; this canceled version was ultimately finished and released as part of the Japan-exclusive GameCube compilation Nintendo Puzzle Collection.The Panel de Pon version of the game was later digitally re-released in Japan as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (on November 27, 2007), Wii U (on May 25, 2013), and Nintendo 3DS (on August 9, 2016). It was later included in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online collection worldwide for the Nintendo Switch on May 20, 2020, making this version's first debut outside of Japan. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay consists of a well partially filled with either 5 or 6 distinct types of tiles, depending on the difficulty level. Adjacent tiles may be swapped horizontally with the cursor, and matching three or more tiles vertically or horizontally will result in the tiles clearing after a short delay animation, during which they become immovable. Additional points may be earned with either ""combos,"" which involve clearing more than 3 tiles simultaneously, or ""chains,"" which require that the tiles above a clearing set fall into another clear. During play, the stack of tiles will slowly rise to the top of the screen, though clearing tiles will pause this advance. After a grace period after the stack reaches the top of the well, the game will end. </div>  <div> Game Modes : There are 5 major game modes in Tetris Attack. In most modes, a difficulty level may be selected, and in some modes an initial speed may be selected; this may be confusing to new players, but while the difficulty level affects the rate at which death occurs, the number of tile types in play, and the rate at which tiles fall upon finding themselves in mid-air, the initial speed merely controls the speed at which the stack rises. </div>  <div> Characters & Stages : This mode allows the player to select a difficulty level and speed, and allows nearly limitless play. The name of the mode is misleading, however, as gameplay will necessarily end: either the player will die, or reach 99,999 points, upon which the game will end. Should the player reach this maximum point score, credits will be rolled. </div>  <div> Scoring : This mode provides a 2 minute length of time in which to earn as many points as possible. The difficulty and speed may be set prior to the game. This mode may be played with either 1 or 2 players. </div>  <div> Advanced Gameplay Mechanics : The Stage Clear mode requires that players clear the stack down to a particular ""clear line"" to pass each stage, of which there are several per character in the game. In addition, there are certain ""boss battles,"" in which the player must earn points as quickly as possible to reduce the boss's HP level to zero. </div>  <div> Story and Multiple Endings : This mode involves a collection of designed puzzles, of which there are ten per character in the game, as well as many ""special"" levels, totaling 120 levels. Each involves a set of tiles that must be cleared completely within the predetermined number of tile swaps. </div> "

The game is very similar to the Contra franchise (more specifically, Contra III: The Alien Wars), but was criticized for being of exceptionally lower quality. The game was criticized for its poor artificial intelligence, sloppy control, no continues, and general lack of challenge. Reviewers agreed that the game's music was its best aspect. Time Slip holds a 36% average on Game Rankings. </div>  <div> Plot : Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh gets in the time machine.Time Slip stars Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh, a scientist from the year 2045 who discovers an alien plot to take over Earth. To prevent an invasion of an alien race called the Tiamatians, Dr. Gilgamesh travels to various eras of time to defeat the aliens (as they have found a way to exploit rifts in time).The background of the Tiamatians is simple; they are from the planet Tiamat. The aliens want to find a planet similar to Tiamat, so they send a probe through the rift called the Torquemada II. Through use of that probe, they find Earth, and intend to turn it into Tiamat II. By then, scientists on Earth have discovered the rift as well, and have been studying it for years.If the player gets a game over during gameplay, Dr. Gilgamesh fails to prevent the aliens from conquering Earth, and it is hinted that his birth is even prevented. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Time Slip was criticized for being far too easy.The game is very similar to Contra III: The Alien Wars. Even movements mirror those of Contra III. Time Slip does have its numerous differences, however. One such differences is the TGS bar (essentially a power bar, that must constantly be refilled). This TGS bar is what keeps Dr. Gilgamesh alive, and if it runs out he dies. To refill the bar, players must be picking up crystals scattered throughout the levels.Every level is filled with various enemies, a mid-level boss, and a level boss. The game was notoriously easy, even with its later bosses. Scattered throughout the levels are traps based on the time period Dr. Gilgamesh is in. Similarly to Contra III, the player can upgrade weapons as gameplay progresses. By picking up power-ups (found in boxes that must be ""shot"" open), the player can improve the weapon (although these upgrades are lost after death). Time Slip even contains some vehicles for the player to use, although they do not dramatically alter gameplay.Time Slip, unlike Contra III, has no continues, and rather starts the player out with nine lives. In addition, there is no code to expand the player's lives (Contra III contains the famous Konami Code). Time Slip has no way to save the game either, and no password system, so if the player dies, they have to start completely over. </div> "

Pressing the triggers pulls up left and right over the shoulder views respectively, which also include a detailed portrait of the pilot and part of the plane.The difficulty of landing necessitated the inclusion of a separate mode accessible from the main menu that allows players to practice it. </div> "

Ultima VI is notable for its single-scale world, in which cities blend seamlessly into the overworld, its strong moral sense, and its unstructured, non-linear gameplay -- a harbinger of what would later be called sandbox games.The Ultima VI engine would see use in the Worlds of Ultima series, which took place outside the main Ultima universe.Ultima VI was the final Ultima to see release on a wide variety of personal computer platforms, ranging from the C64 to the Atari ST, to the Amiga, FM Towns, PC98, X68K, and the PC, and years later on the SNES. Ultima VI was the first Ultima game not available on the Apple II. </div>  <div> Background : In Ultima VI, as in the previous two Ultima games, the player assumes the role of the Avatar, the embodiment of virtue and hope for the lands of Britannia. The game begins with the Avatar on Earth, enjoying a computer game, when a moongate suddenly appears. They enter through it, only to find themselves in the middle of a ritual sacrifice conducted by the winged, demonic-looking race known as Gargoyles. Although the Avatar is bound to the altar, and all appears lost, their companions -- Iolo. Shamino, and Dupre -- appear and free him. They then find themselves back in Lord British's castle, where they discover that the shrines of the virtues are under attack by the Gargoyles. The Avatar is tasked with freeing the shrines and discovering the nature of the Gargoyle invasion. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Similarly to other Ultimas, they are free to build their character, via stat points, in any way they wish. The Avatar is capable of using all weapons and spells in the game; however by increasing either STR, DEX, or INT, either melee, ranged, or magic attacks will be increased in effectiveness.Like other games in the series, the Avatar gathers a party to fight alongside them. They start off with three members, Iolo the Bard, Shamino the Ranger, and Dupre the Knight, but they can take any number of different characters with them, each of which have their own stats and uses. While the Avatar is the main character of the game, it is possible to take control over individual characters at times (which can have strategic uses), although the player cannot talk to other NPCs unless they are controlling the Avatar.As a sandbox-style game, Ultima VI lets the player do things different ways. There is not set order to completing objectives or visiting dungeons. There are a number of optional areas to visit and weapons to obtain. It is easy to miss things unless they explore every area. There is no level gating -- the player can explore the entire world from the get go. Ultima VI has a handful of travel options -- in addition to running, the Avatar can buy a horse, a boat, or ride a raft.The Avatar can rob stores, steal from the bank, and kill NPCS. They can kill a farmer's cow for meat, or milk it for milk to churn into butter. Take flour, and bake bread with it. Buy a ship and explore, or kill the shipwright and steal all his deeds. Ultima VI had a large number of what would now be called crafting opportunities, in which the player can take items gathered from the world and combine them to create something new.Although the player has a great deal of freedom, Ultima VI has, in the background and hidden from the player, something called Karma. Stealing or unprovoked killing decrease karma, while doing certain missions increases it.

Ultima VII: The Black Gate,Origin Systems,FCI,November 1994,snes,The Avatar returns to the world of Britannia to face a new threat from a mysterious cult and its enigmatic god known as the Guardian in the seventh game of the Ultima series.,3030-230,230,0,1992-04-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/ultima-vii-the-black-gate/3030-230/,," <div> Overview : The Guardian appears to the Avatar.Ultima VII is a top down, Western style role playing game for the PC with a real-time combat system. Released in 1992, Ultima VII is set in the mythical realm of Britannia and features the hero character of the series known as The Avatar. The story takes the Avatar back to Britannia, where 200 years have passed since the events of the previous game, Ultima VI: The False Prophet.The game was also ported to the Super Nintendo (in 1994) and Mac. The SNES version saw both US and Japan releases. Ultima VII: The Black Gate ends of a cliffhanger that is resolved in Ultima VII Part 2: Serpent Isle. It also received an expansion disk named Forge of Virtue. Ultima VII and its sequel and expansions were also included in numerous Ultima compilations. </div>  <div> Story : After being contacted through his computer by a mysterious red entity, the Avatar enters the moongate in his backyard and travels through the gate from Earth to Britannia. He finds himself in the town of Trinsic, where a gruesome double murder has taken place. In the process of uncovering the clues towards solving the murders, the Avatar first comes in contact with The Fellowship, a new philosophical organization founded by a druid named Batlin. The Fellowship follow a new doctrine which conflicts with the Eight Virtues enshrined by Lord British, but make a great deal of how they have improved the lives of Britannia's citizens. After leaving Trinsic, the Avatar discovers that the magic users of the world are going crazy, and that the strange material blackrock is somehow connected to it. By following the trail of two of The Fellowship's leaders, the Avatar uncovers the true origins and purpose of the group. After foiling the attempt of the Guardian to invade through the Black Gate, the Avatar finds himself trapped in Britannia and unable to return to Earth.The Black Gate is the first installment of ""The Age of Apocalypse,"" the final story arc of the main Ultima series. It strikes a darker tone than its predecessors, which becomes apparent when one of the first things the player encounters is a blood-soaked, grisly murder scene. Corruption -- in both political and spiritual forms -- is one of the game's major themes. </div>  <div> Gameplay : inventory systemUltima VII features a sophisticated skill and inventory system that allows the player to develop the character in ways that match their playing style. Along the way, the Avatar will meet new NPCs, and old friends from past games who they can invite into their party. While Ultima VII was not the first game in the series to feature mouse support, it was the first to feature a ""point and click"" user interface as its preferred form of input.An expansion pack Ultima VII: The Forge of Virtue was released in 1992. It is included in most later releases of the game. </div>  <div> Development : At the time of its release, Ultima VII was known for being very demanding on PC system resources. Contributing to this fact was the game's use of the problematic Voodoo Memory Manager, which was incompatible with other memory managers.EA's Tetrahedron GeneratorUltima VII was the last Ultima game to be published before Origin Systems was bought by Electronic Arts. Like Ultima VI before it, the game included several veiled jabs at EA, as Origin had a tumultuous relationship with the publisher even before the takeover. In the game, the evil Guardian uses three Blackrock Generators to disrupt magic throughout Britannia and broadcast his insidious messages into the minds of its populace. The three generators were built in the shape of a cube, a sphere and a tetrahedron, matching the appearance of the original Electronic Arts logo.The Super Nintendo port of Ultima VII was severely shortened and simplified, leaving out many of the game's darker elements. </div>  <div> Exult : As Ultima VII is DOS game that is unable to play correctly on Windows XP and beyond, the fan community created a program that allows users to play it on those operating systems. Exult is an emulator designed to allow people who own legitimate copies of Ultima VII to play it on modern operating systems. Development was originally started by Jeff Freedman specifically for the X Window System, hence Ex-Ult. Since it's original development it has been ported across a number of platforms from Windows PCs to Pocket PCs, Linux and OSX.Exult allows players to play through both the original Ultima VII: The Black Gate (with The Forge of Virtue add on) and the sequel Ultima VII: Serpent Isle (with The Silver Seed add on) campaigns. The developers not only allowed players to relive the experience of Ultima VII but also allowed for changes and tweaks to be added to the game and its interfaces.One minor interface change that was added to a version of Exult was to give players the option to use the ""Paperdoll"" inventory system from Serpent Isle in Black Gate. A more recent and larger change was added in the form of craftable items and extra quests. While this required the player download various hacked data files it provided an extension of the original gameplay.While the Exult project has no official support from EA (the current owners of the Ultima franchise) developers of the original game have shown their support, most notably Richard Garriott, who in a letter to the Exult team wrote:"" Just so that you know. On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this. Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems that run them go away"" </div>  <div> Availability : This game is currently available at gog.com and is included in the ""Ultima 7 Complete Edition"" package. </div> "

Rather than ""Super"", the S in the title actually stands for Special.The game contains a single-player mode which works like a Final Fight type brawler, only without the freedom to move up and down the screen. This mode has intermittent boss encounters which play out like Street Fighter one-on-one fights. There is also a versus mode for up to two human players that features a plethora of characters that do not appear in the story.The game was later rereleased as Hiryu no Ken S: Hyper Version. Though largely the same game as Golden Fighter, it received a few performance and gameplay tweaks as well as new enemy placement for the single player mode.

Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3,Avalanche Software,Williams Entertainment,"June 26, 1996",snes,"Considered one of the most competitive fighting games out of the entire franchise, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is an update to the third installment that brings back masked ninjas while tweaking character balances.",3030-2178,2178,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/ultimate-mortal-kombat-3/3030-2178/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : The masked ninjas return.Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway on November 1995 for arcades.It is a direct update to Mortal Kombat 3, adding new characters (all of which are the return of masked ninjas), arenas, special moves, and game modes (including an 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), while tweaking gameplay mechanics and character balancing. It is regarded as the most competitive game in the Mortal Kombat franchise (prior to its 2011 reboot). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as Mortal Kombat Trilogy).In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a ""Run Meter"", which limits their ability to run forward, and ""chain combos"", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.BRUTALITY!Fatalities, Friendships, Babalities, Mercy, and Animalities return from Mortal Kombat 3. However, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions sacrificed Mercy and Animalities for a new type of finishing move: Brutalities. Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in Mortal Kombat), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The ""Choose Your Destiny"" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each ""tower"". Additionally, there is a ""Master II"" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the ""tower"" while making the game more difficult.More ""Kombat Kodes"", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three ""Ultimate Kombat Kodes"", ten-digit codes that are entered during the Game Over screen, with three new characters to unlock. The Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection removed Kombat Kodes from the online component in the game. </div>  <div> Characters : Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 also includes three gameplay modes, each requiring a different amount of credits to start:Mortal Kombat - Traditional game mode with one-on-one fights.4 Player 2-on-2 Kombat - A multiplayer tag-team fight in similar vein to Endurance Matches.8 Player Tournament - A single-elimination tournament for eight players. </div>  <div> Arenas : New to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is the concept of Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures, in which completing the game gives the player a choice between a group of bonuses ranging from battling secret characters to watching a demonstration of each Fatality in the game. These groups are restricted by the difficulty the game was completed on. 8-Player Tournament mode also gives the player access to Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures at the end.Novice Difficulty and higherShows the character's endingPlay a clone of Galaga (only previously accessible through a Kombat Kode or reaching 100 battles)Battle with ErmacBattle with Noob SaibotWarrior Difficulty and higherRandom TreasureFatality Demonstration #1Fatality Demonstration #2Fatality Demonstration #3Endurance Match against Noob Saibot and ErmacMaster Difficulty and higherEndurance Match against masked Sub-Zero and Noob SaibotEndurance Match against Noob Saibot, Ermac, human Smoke, masked Sub-Zero, and MileenaMaster II DifficultySupreme Demonstration (shows most Fatalities, Babalities, Friendships, and Animalities) </div>  <div> Versions & Ports : The 22 playable characters (including the three unlockable characters)The game includes 19 playable starting characters, two unplayable bosses, four playable secret characters, and one unplayable secret opponent.

Through new ""Ultimate Kombat Kodes"", Mileena, a masked Sub-Zero, and a new ninja character (Ermac) are unlockable as playable characters. A pre-indoctrinated version of Smoke, known as Human Smoke, is playable by holding a special button combination when choosing the robotic Smoke.Noob Saibot is still a hidden, unplayable opponent. However, because of the inclusion of masked male ninjas, he is no longer a palette swap of Kano (except in the Sega Saturn version). Featured in the game's opening gameplay montage is Rain, a dark purple palette swap of the male ninjas that serves as nothing more as a fake hidden character for stirring up rumors.

This game uses the engine of the SNES port of the arcade game Ultraman but populates the game with monsters from the Ultraman: Towards the Future TV series (known as Ultraman Great in Japan), which was airing in the US at the time. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As Ultraman Great, the player has one button for kick attacks, one for punch attacks and one for the laser. The punch is a short range attack while the kick is a long ranged one. It's also possible to perform uppercuts and a reverse kick. As the fight continues, the laser's power builds up. The player controls the power of the lasers with R and L and must use the 4th and highest level of power - the Specium Beam - to defeat the foe. This is the only way to finish off the enemies for good, as they will constantly regenerate their health otherwise. As opponents get stronger, however, they find ways of avoiding this special attack. The player must anticipate their attempt to dodge it in order to win.Ultraman can only fight for three minutes. This is an element from the show: the Earth's pollution is too caustic to maintain his enormous form for too long. Therefore, in addition to wearing the enemy down and finishing them off with the special this must all be done in 180 seconds or less. </div> "

They're attacking the Atolls and the player must destroy them with their missiles. They must also save drowning civilians.

He starts off with a machete but can get other weapons, such as a gun, from the enemies he kills. The player always plays on the exact same level as they're always defending the same Atoll. Bonus levels: The player unlocks these after completing a boat level. It consists of the Mariner swimming underwater, trying to get bonus items before they run out of breath. If he runs out of breath while underwater, the player automatically loses all the items they had collected. These items earn points that can then be spent in the in-game shop to upgrade the ship. </div> "

One player controls Annie while the other controls Clint. By pressing the face buttons at the character select screen, the player can determine what color palette their character uses. </div> "

Wing Commander,Origin Systems,Mindscape,November 1992,snes,"Wing Commander is one of the most famous early forays into the space simulation genre. Originally released as a PC game, it spawned three full sequels and was emulated heavily during much of the 1990s.",3030-16002,16002,0,1990-07-18,https://www.giantbomb.com/wing-commander/3030-16002/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Wing Commander is a single-player flight game that popularized the space flight simulator genre and paved the way for games such as the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series. A war rages between the Terran Confederation and the cat-like alien Kilrathi. The player is a rookie pilot on the Terran capital ship the TCS Tiger's Claw. Cinematic intros and a sythesized orchestral score provide a space opera feel.The single player campaign consists of a branching story arc that begins with the player in control of a lightly powered patrol craft. Continued success will lead to the unlocking of better equipped vessels. Failure will lead to missions with overwhelming odds, possibly resulting in the destruction of the Tiger's Claw and the end of the campaign. Campaign progress is broken up by adventure game style breaks in the pilot's lounge. The player can communicate with wingmates and fellow pilots using text-based menus and the dialogue will reflect previous mission results. If the wingmate dies on a mission, their chair/locker/barstool will be unoccupied and their name crossed off on the killboard.Missions are launched from the briefing room, with a series of checkpoints to visit and objectives to accomplish. Mission types offer some variety between patrols, escort duty, attack runs and investigations. Missions frequently change from their original description en route as the player encounters enemy Kilrathi and is forced to make snap decisions to maintain the mission.The game used 2D sprites rendered out at various angles to simulate a 3D entity in a similar way that Doom would use later to represent its computer controlled enemies. Even this simulated 3D experience taxed computer systems of the time to their limits; when played on the standard Amiga home computer, the framerate would often dip well into single digits when space battles got frantic. </div> "

The Tiger's Claw must follow the weapon deep into Kilrathi space to find the dreaded Sivar. The game also features new ships and an increase in difficulty.The Secret Missions was followed by a second expansion pack, also set between the events of Wing Commander and Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. Wing Commander: The Secret Missions 2: Crusade is set in a region of space inhabited by a bird-like race the Firekkans who wish to fight the Kilrathi alongside the Terran Federation.As with the original game, Wing Commander: The Secret Missions was ported to the Super Nintendo.

Only the brave need apply in delving into the mysteries surrounding the Heart of the Maelstrom.,3030-13839,13839,0,1992-11-20,https://www.giantbomb.com/wizardry-v-heart-of-the-maelstrom/3030-13839/,," <div> Overview : Wizardry V is a first-person, grid-based, RPG that stands as a wholly separate adventure without an arc associated with it. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers surrounding the so-called Heart of the Maelstrom stirring beneath a fantastic castle. It should not be confused with the Japanese version of the series which had long since spun off from the main franchise. It was published in October, 1992.As in all other Wizardry games, Wizardry V is played from a first person 3D perspective. It would be the last game in the series to feature wire-frame dungeon walls, text-only interface design, and static 2D monster portraits although the visuals would be significantly upgraded for its console release on the SNES. On PCs, however, the various game environments are primarily distinguished from each other by (often quite verbose) text descriptions. Similarly, text messages and non-interactive dialogue sequences are used to advance the plot.The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. The original release of the game lacked mouse support but this was later added to subsequent versions.Wizardry V did not offer an import option for characters/parties created in the first four titles.Among the other features of the game were:Over 70 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes withThe game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed.The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry V appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text, it also outlined several key monsters/encounters that the party may discover on their trips into the Maze. </div>  <div> Story : Long ages have passed within the Kingdom of Llylgamyn. The evil of Werdna is but legend, the secrets of the Knight of Diamonds long forgotten, and the Mad Overlord has become but a story to scare little children into doing what their parents say. The descendants of the legendary heroes of old have long since disappeared, but the Orb that they had recovered in their last and greatest adventure continues to provide knowledge to those that seek its wisdom. With its revelations on the secrets of life and magic, it spurred much debate and would found a new school of magic organized around what it had shared with those that dared to look into its depths. The Orb was handed to the Brotherhood of Llylgamym for safekeeping and peace reigned throughout the land.But things began to grow dark once more. Strange weather was the first sign, sickness the next. What was happening? People looked to the orb for help, fearing that it had lost its powers. The High Council was called together behind closed doors. Weeks passed, but with the use of powerful magic and the grace of both the ancient and new gods, they found what they were looking for.They discovered that the very fabric of reality was coming apart and that the source of this chaos was an unnatural, magical vortex located beneath the Brotherhood's Temple within a maze of caverns and tunnels. It was a place known as the Maelstrom. It had long been a home to foul beasts and the outcasts of the land and there, a great evil now festered threatening not only the land but the entire world. All that we knew may cease to exist if its growth isn't stopped.They sages of the High Council knew only one answer: to seek the help of a demi-god known as the Gatekeeper. Once a mortal, his power grew to a point where it soon became divine and had inherited the responsibility of watching over and maintaining the balance of magic and the natural world. He might be their only hope, assuming that he would listen to mortals.But the sages were confident that their call would be answered, so grave was the danger. However, to their utter horror, they learned that the Gatekeeper himself was held prisoner in the heart of the very vortex they wished him to destroy! Terrified, the Sages turned ot the Brotherhood whose knowledge of the mystical and magical exceeded their own. Here, a tale of evil and treachery was scried by Brother Drew, High Prophet of the Brotherhood.They learned of a renegade Brother, a woman named the Sorn, whose wish it is to end all order in the universe. She had discovered a means to create an ever-growing rift in reality...the very vortex that now threatens the land. From this destruction will come a new universe where chaos will reign and the world will no longer exist. It was she who trapped the Gatekeeper and made him prisoner. She must be stopped lest everyone perish in her madness.It has been three years since these events were discovered and the vortex continues to grow. Time is growing short. Two of the most powerful sages in the kingdom, Fontizan and the High Sage Yeldarb have begun to seek warriors brave enough to enter the caverns beneath the Temple of the Brotherhood, find the Gatekeeper, and free him from the vortex. However, they must first defeat the evil Sorn.In order to even have a chance, the adventurers must first seek out G'bli Gedook, the High Priest of the Brotherhood. He is the guardian of the Orb of Llylgamym and resides in the first layer of the caverns just under the temple. From there, they must descend into the depths of the Maze and battle whatever the Sorn can conjure up to stop them.After many battles and adventures, a party did achieve the impossible and confronted the Sorn deep below the Temple. By closing the Triaxial Gate which was the source of the rift and calling forth the Gatekeeper, they destroyed the shield that had protected the Sorn and its minions. In the battle that followed, the Sorn was ultimately defeated and the Triaxial Balance restored. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Wizardry V is a tile or grid based movement, first-person RPG set in a mysterious Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to stop the nefarious Sorn dwelling within the Heart of the Maelstrom. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the Maze and deal with its dangerous inhabitants as well as solve the puzzles that stand in their way.The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap (which had yet to become a standard feature of RPGs at the time of W6's release) means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry V's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them.Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn. </div>  <div> Special Monsters : This was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey:Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's ""uncursed.""Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze. Other adventurers, monsters, and even a few riddles await them here as they head ever deeper into the depths in search of evil.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own. </div>  <div> Character Development : Not every monster wants to stick the party's heads on a pike and some might even be very helpful. When these NPCs (non-player characters) are encountered, the party have several options that they can explore. They can talk to them which brings up a text parser for inquiries to made with, similar to that found in interactive fiction.The player can also barter with them if they have anything to sell, or if they want to buy something from the party. The party can also opt to give them something for free in order to get onto their good side. Stealing is also another option and a charm spell can also be cast to help them see the party in a better light. Or, if the player wants, they can just opt to fight and kill whoever they had been having a nice conversation with. The player just needs be sure they can live with the consequences, or have enough coin to resurrect them with once they've had their fun. </div>  <div> Combat : Wizardry V's puzzles were focused primarily around riddles and items that were needed to get by certain obstacles. Most notable was its maze-like dungeon with many random encounters thrown in for good measure.Picking Locks and Disarming TrapsPicking locks was as simple as having a Thief (or a mage with the proper spell) in the party to do so depending on their expertise. Disarming traps, especially on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed. </div>  <div> Trivia : This command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose. </div> "

Wolfenstein 3D,Imagineer,Imagineer,March 1994,snes,"Considered by many to be the progenitor of the first-person shooter genre, Wolfenstein 3D is a 1992 first-person action game that pits the player, as Allied spy William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz, against the might of Nazi Germany.",3030-7694,7694,0,1992-05-05,https://www.giantbomb.com/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview : Wolfenstein 3D (often stylized as Wolfenstein 3-D) is a first-person shooter developed by id and released by Apogee (via shareware and mail order) on May 5, 1992 for the PC (running MS-DOS).Loosely inspired by the Castle Wolfenstein series of stealth action games, the game is often cited as the progenitor of the modern first-person shooter genre.Set in World War II, players control Captain William ""B.J."" Blazkowicz, an Allied spy imprisoned by the Nazi regime while attempting to uncover the plans of the mysterious ""Operation Eisenfaust"". After overpowering a guard and stealing his Luger P08, B.J. must traverse the depths of the fortified stronghold (known as Castle Wolfenstein) and find a way to escape. The subsequent episodes in the trilogy deal with B.J.'s pursuit against Operation Eisenfaust (which turned out to be the creation of undead Nazi mutants) and B.J.'s infiltration into the bunker of Adolf Hitler.The game was originally released in a three-episode trilogy, with the first episode (dealing with the escape from Castle Wolfenstein) as the widely-released shareware episode. A deluxe add-on could have been bought (either separately or bundled with the original trilogy) that added three more episodes (known as ""The Nocturnal Missions""), which serve as the game's prequel (as B.J. must investigate Nazi plans for chemical warfare). Commercial versions of the game (released throughout the years by GT Interactive, Activision, Apogee, and id) contained all six episodes.Over the years, the original MS-DOS game has been ported to a variety of platforms. Early ports (in which major graphical and gameplay differences are common) include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Atari Jaguar, Macintosh computers, the Acorn Archimedes, the 3DO, the Apple IIgs, and the NEC PC-9801. Later ports (near-identical to the original game) were released for the Game Boy Advance, Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), Steam (using DOSBox), and all iOS devices. To commemorate the game's 20th anniversary, Bethesda released a browser-based version of the game (including only the original trilogy). Due to the release of the game's source code in 1995 (a practice id would continue with its later games), various unofficial modifications had been created and various ports have been made for additional platforms (including Linux computers, the Dreamcast, and the Sega 32X).Due to the extensive references to Nazism (including graphics depicting swastikas and the title screen theme depicting the anthem of the Nazi party), the game is in violation of German criminal code and is banned in Germany. Some versions (namely the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version) removed the references while censoring the game's violence (for instance, removing blood and changing attack dogs to mutant rats). Some later ports (namely the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions) removed references to the Red Cross (replacing the ""red cross"" of medical items with a heart symbol).Wolfenstein 3D was followed by a standalone expansion (and prequel) in 1992, titled Spear of Destiny. id has, since then, been a co-developer with several reboots of the Wolfenstein franchise, including 2001's Return to Castle Wolfenstein, 2008's Wolfenstein RPG, and 2009's Wolfenstein. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The objective of Wolfenstein 3D is simply to navigate a variety of maze-like three-dimensional levels, with the ultimate goal being to find the designated exit point, thereby transporting the player to the next level in the sequence. Along the way, the player must engage in first-person firefights with a variety of opponents in order to ensure their survival, all the while keeping an eye out for new weapons and pickups that restore ammo and health so as to tip the odds in their favour. Many levels incorporate locked doors, which may only be opened once the player has located and picked up the associated Key (either Silver or Gold), and exploration is also encouraged, as secret areas are found in abundance throughout the game. These hidden zones are more often than not tremendously helpful, being filled with health pickups, ammo, weaponry, or in rare cases revealing the entrance to a secret level. The game consists of six episodes comprised of ten levels each, with all episodes culminating in a climactic boss fight. After each level the player is taken to a summary screen where they are rated according to various metrics, including kill count and the percentage of treasures and secrets found in the level.The game includes a number of arcade-like elements, including lives and a scoring system, with points awarded for kills and collecting treasures within levels. The player begins each episode with only three lives, but can be awarded additional lives for every 40,000 points they amass, or for finding 1-Ups, up to a potential maximum of nine lives. Upon death, the player returns to the beginning of the current level with only their starting weapons, the Knife and Pistol, and must replay it from scratch. If the player loses all of their lives, they cannot continue at all, and must instead start from the beginning of the episode with three lives. These systems are somewhat trivialized by Wolfenstein 3D's save game system, however, which allows the player to save the game at any point and reload that save without restrictions. Thus, players are essentially able to use this system to restart an infinite number of times while also minimizing many of the normal penalties associated with death, such as lost progress and stripped weaponry. </div>  <div> Episodes : In Wolfenstein 3D, each episode consists of ten floors (one of which is a secret floor, accessible only by finding a secret elevator exit in a specific level of the episode). In the ninth and final floor, players must face a formidable foe (the episode's ""boss"") in order to proceed. </div>  <div> Weapons : The first episode, ""Escape from Wolfenstein"", served as the game's shareware episode, with the remaining two episodes available in mail-order. Commercial versions of the game included all three episodes (as well as The Nocturnal Missions below).Episode 1: ""Escape from Wolfenstein"" - Sent in on a reconnaissance mission to find plans detailing Operation Eisenfaust, B.J. is captured and imprisoned in the depths of Castle Wolfenstein. After overpowering a guard in his cell and taking his pistol, Blazkowicz must escape from the fortified stronghold to continue his mission. Chief among his concerns is Hans Grosse, the fearsome head guard stationed at Castle Wolfenstein.Episode 2: ""Operation: Eisenfaust"" - After escaping from Castle Wolfenstein, B.J. continues to investigate reports of Operation: Eisenfaust, only to find out that the Nazis are creating an army of undead mutants deep within Castle Hollehammer. B.J. must now fight his way through hordes of the zombified Nazi soldiers (alongside normal guards) and stop the plan at its source (by eliminating the demented head scientist, Dr. Schabbs).Episode 3: ""Die, Führer, Die!"" - After the downfall of Operation: Eisenfaust, B.J. is sent to infiltrate a heavily fortified underground Nazi bunker deep under the Reichstag, where he must find and eliminate the head of the entire Nazi regime: Adolf Hitler. </div>  <div> Items : Formerly an add-on trilogy to complement the original game, The Nocturnal Missions serve as a prequel to B.J.'s imprisonment at Castle Wolfenstein. All commercial versions of the game include the trilogy.Episode 4: ""A Dark Secret"" - Intelligence has uncovered a horrifying Nazi plot to begin large-scale chemical warfare against Allied armies, tied to a chemical weapons manufacturer. B.J. must infiltrate the weapons research facility and hunt down the manufacturer: Dr. Otto Giftmacher.Episode 5: ""Trail of the Madman"" - With Giftmacher dead and the Nazi supply of chemical weaponry cut off, B.J. must now pursue General Fettgesicht, the man in charge of the Nazis' chemical warfare initiative, as the chemical bombardment has already commenced. Traveling deep within Castle Erlangen, B.J. must find documents which detail the specifics of the coming ""Giftkrieg"" (Poison War) and discover the location of General Fettgesicht. However, these documents are heavily guarded by soldiers led by fearsome head guard Gretel Grosse.Episode 6: ""Confrontation"" - After recovering the ""Giftkrieg"" plans, B.J. determines General Fettgesicht's location: Castle Offenbach. To ensure that the Nazi's chemical warfare is well and truly defeated, B.J. travels to Offenbach personally in order to assassinate Fettgesicht. </div>  <div> Enemies : The original PC release of Wolfenstein 3D features four weapons: a knife, a pistol, and two automatic weapons. All three of the game's ranged weapons are hitscan, and all three of them use the same ammunition (vaguely referred to as ""bullets"") with the only difference between them being rate of fire. This makes it very important to monitor ammunition levels and refrain from being too trigger-happy (especially with the ammo-eating Chaingun), since running out of bullets renders the player unable to use any firearms (forcing them into the unenviable position of having to attack ranged opponents with only their knife).All normal hitscan weapons deal a random amount of damage per shot from 0 HP to 16 HP. Close-ranged attacks deal 4x the amount of damage, while long-ranged attacks have a chance to miss (proportional to the distance away from the player).

It is known for its unique premise (a fighting game based on historical figures), its simplistic control scheme (two basic attack buttons, which can be held down for stronger attacks, and a dedicated ""throw"" button), and its ""Death Match"" mode (an optional game mode where each arena has a variety of obstacles. It received three sequels throughout the early '90s.Along with a release for the Neo Geo AES (on September 11, 1992), the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (by Sunsoft on September 1993) and to the Sega Genesis (exclusively in North America by Sega on July 1994). It was also ported to the Neo Geo CD (with an arranged soundtrack) on March 17, 1995. The original game was digitally re-released by D4 for the Wii (via Virtual Console) on September 28, 2007 and by HAMSTER (as part of the Arcade Archives series) for the PlayStation 4 (on January 26, 2017) and Xbox One (on February 23, 2017). It was also included in the 2008  World Heroes Anthology compilation for the  PlayStation 2 and is an unlockable game in the  SNK Arcade Classics V.1 compilation for the PlayStation 2,  PlayStation Portable, and Wii. </div>  <div> Gameplay : World Heroes plays like a traditional 2D fighter. Along with two standard attack buttons (one for punches, one for kicks), the game features a dedicated button for throwing (making the character vulnerable if they whiff the throw).Holding down either the Punch or Kick buttons makes the attack stronger, while simply tapping the button gives a quick strike. This can be modified in the SNES version so that each attack strength is its own dedicated button (making the controls more responsive). </div>  <div> Characters : Inspired by the growing popularity of hardcore wrestling in Japan, Death Match is an optional game mode that pits both fighters in a wrestling ring with one or more traps:Wall Traps - All three traps function the same: touching both edges of the arena cause the player character to become damaged and knocked away towards the center of the arena. High Energy stages, where the ropes are electrified, are used in Hanzo's, Rasputin's, and Geegus's stages. Needle stages, where both sides of the arena have spiked walls, are used in Brocken's and Fuuma's stages. The Fire stage, where the ropes are on fire, is used in J. Carn's stage.Floor Traps - The floor may be covered in one of two traps: Oil (slippery puddles that slide characters around as they enter it) and Minefield (which periodically spawn exploding mines at the feet of each character, causing damage and knockdown). Oil stages are used in Dragon's, Fuuma's, and Rasputin's stages. Minefield stages are used in M. Power's and Geegus's stages.Instead of traps, Janne's stage is ""Hair Splitting"", which means that the losing character must shave their head (as shown in the post-match versus screen). Regardless, all stages use the same music (as opposed to the regular mode, where each stage has their own music). </div> "

THQ released a title with phenomenal visuals and an impressive amount of customization for your entrance. They even attempt to mimic the camera angles popularized on the RAW broadcast, so you'll see the action from a long list of unusual perspectives.It also had a fairly unique game mechanic in that a health meter is replaced with a popularity meter. If the crowd is really behind somebody, you won't be able to pin them, which makes it vital that one really beats down on their opponent to win. You have to work an offense based on this, so spamming a certain move actually backfires as if you do a certain move repeatedly, the audience will cease responding to it and it will end up not doing much to actually defeat the opponent. If the man is pinnable and you do not pin them, the crowd will turn on you as well. Obviously, the more popular the wrestler (such as Rock), the more difficult it is to defeat them. It is possible, but it is quite difficult. The reversal engine is based primarily on timing button presses.The grappling engine seems to borrow, somewhat, from THQ's UFC titles of that era. The grappling engine hit a medium between the No Mercy and Smackdown series.There is no appreciable storyline in the game, something that had started appearing in wrestling games at about that point. The matches also tended to run fairly long. 15 minute or more matches are not all that unusual in WWF RAW, making quick pick-up-and-play sessions a bit of a challenge to pull off. And while the customization in your entrance is very in-depth, the customization of your characters appearance and moveset is far less in-depth. There is also no real weight classification. Anybody can do all of their moves to anybody else, no matter the size difference. Women wrestlers can bodyslam The Undertaker without a problem, for example. </div>  <div> Roster : Al SnowAlbertThe Big ShowBilly GunBradshawBubba Ray DudleyChris BenoitChris JerichoChristianCrash HollyD-Von DudleyEddie GuerreroEdgeFaarooqFunakiHakuHardcore HollyIvoryJeff HardyJustin CredibleK-KwikKaneKurt AngleLitaMatt HardyMolly HollyPerry SaturnRavenRhinoRikishiThe RockSpike DudleySteve AustinSteve BlackmanTajiriTAKA MichinokuTazzTestTriple HThe Blue MeanieTrish StratusThe UndertakerVince McMahonWilliam RegalX-PacShane McMahonStephanie McMahon-HelmsleyFred Durst </div> "

The game's title is based around the  WWF's yearly pay-per-view event of the same name. This was  THQ's 3rd effort under the World Wrestling Federation banner since signing a 10-year contract to make WWF (which became World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002) games. Despite being created for arcades, a console port for the  Sega Dreamcast was created and released to stores in North America on August 15, 2000, a few weeks after the machines were sent out to arcades. A European version was released for the Dreamcast on September 22, 2000. A Japanese version was released for the Dreamcast on April 26, 2001. Yuke's developed both versions, though publishing rights were split.  Sega published the arcade version while THQ published the Dreamcast version. The arcade version ran on the Sega NAOMI hardware. The arcade cabinet had a dual monitor design to allow up to four players to play simultaneously; two on one screen, two on another. The Dreamcast version also allowed for four simultaneous players.   </div>  <div> Gameplay : WWF Royal Rumble was a ground-breaking wrestling game in terms of technical capability. Previously, wrestling games in the  PlayStation/ Nintendo 64 era had been limited to only being able to allow four wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble more than doubled this amount. Running on the Sega NAOMI hardware, it allows up to nine wrestlers to be on screen at the same time. While not so eye-opening for an arcade game, the Dreamcast (which contained hardware very similar to Sega NAOMI) very impressively was able to replicate the arcade's ability to allow nine wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble was the first console wrestling game in the 3D era to break the barrier of having more than four wrestlers on screen at the same time. Beyond that though, there wasn't much else to the game. At a time when console wrestling games and technology were heavily evolving to allow some of the more iconic gimmick matches of the 90s to be simulated in a video game, such as the cage match and the ladder match, many were excited to see what the Dreamcast would be capable of. However, THQ decided to make the Dreamcast version a straight port of the arcade version. Thus, it was critically panned due to its lack of game modes and small roster of WWF wrestlers compared to other games that had already been on the market for months, such as  WWF WrestleMania 2000 for the Nintendo 64 and  WWF SmackDown! for the Sony PlayStation.  </div>  <div> Playable Roster : The only two modes in the game are Exhibition and Royal Rumble. In Exhibition mode, the player chooses a wrestler to play as in a series of singles matches only. He or she is also given the option to select a partner of sorts, despite only being able to wrestle singles matches. The partner is used for selective interference at the command of the player. In singles matches, if the match is nearing the time limit, the ring will fade from the background and the wrestlers will be transferred to a backstage area, such as a kitchen, a boiler room, or a parking lot.In Royal Rumble mode, the mode is patterned around the yearly event but is not directly replicated. Instead of merely surviving, you must be active in eliminating people. You begin the match as your selected character. You have a three-minute timer on the screen. The object is to not get eliminated or let the timer run out. An elimination requires being thrown over the top rope and hitting the floor with both feet. Eliminating wrestlers adds 20 seconds to the clock. Eliminating a wrestler with a ""S"" near their feet will add 40 seconds to the clock. In the arcade version, if you get eliminated or the timer runs out, you must insert a credit to continue. In the Dreamcast version, you merely press start to continue. This mode is where the small roster becomes noticeable, as you'll see a handful of wrestlers reappear later in the match. The match requires 30 wrestlers and there are only 19 or 21 wrestlers, depending on the version you are playing. Up to nine wrestlers can be in the ring at one time in this mode.  </div> "

Players can only arrange the group of cookies by shifting entire rows or columns (which wrap around eachother) and the game uses a corner-based ""gravity"" (with tiles ""falling"" both top-to-bottom and right-to-left).Similar to Dr. Mario and Yoshi, the game features characters and settings from Nintendo's Mario series, including mascots Mario and Yoshi (with later versions also including Princess Toadstool and Bowser). Along with a round-based single-player mode, the game includes a unique VS Mode with a special 5x5 playfield and power-ups. The GB version features support for the Four Player Adapter, allowing for four-player multiplayer.It later received a port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. Developed and published by Bullet-Proof Software, the SNES version features two additional modes: a single-player VS Mode (where players play against a CPU opponent) and a Puzzle Mode (where players have a limited amount of moves to clear a static playfield). Its Puzzle Mode is notable for its puzzles designed by Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov.The game was originally developed without Nintendo licensing as an arcade game by Home Data titled Hermetica. Due to poor testing, the game was unreleased and its rights were sold to Bullet-Proof Software, who began producing the SNES version (licensing it to Nintendo for the NES/GB versions, with Nintendo licensing its characters and setting for the SNES version).The SNES version of the game received both a rare tie-in re-release (Yoshi no Cookie: Kuruppon Oven de Cookie) and an enhanced port for the GameCube (as part of the Japanese-exclusive Nintendo Puzzle Collection). The NES version was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2008 (April in North America and Europe, June in Japan). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is made up of a square grid, broken up into 25 to 49 sections (5 x 5 or 7 x 7) depending on the version. Cookies of various decorations fill in the entire grid. The player manipulates entire rows either horizontally or vertically to try to match cookies that are alike. Once a row is filled with cookies of the same design, their point count increases by one and the row is wiped off of the screen. </div>  <div> Yoshi's Cookie: Kuruppon Oven de Cookie : In VS Mode, both players are given a 5x5 board that automatically re-fills after a combo ends and cannot ""over-fill"". The objective is to win rounds by either accumulating 25 points (with each row/column clear worth a point) or having their opponent failing to make a match on a time limit.The game's power-up system is unique in that both its effects and the player receiving these effects change over time, with the possibility that players can penalize themselves if not careful. The player's current power-up is activated once they make a match of Yoshi cookies.Blind - The chosen player cannot see the center 3x3 tiles of their board for a short time.Panic - The chosen player's board is shuffled for a short time.Slave - The chosen player's cursor is now controlled by the other player for a short time.-3, +3, -7, +7 - Removes from, or adds to, the chosen player's Point Meter.In the SNES version, players choose between four characters, each with their own unique stats (mostly affecting how long each power-up effect against them lasts):Mario - Average effect duration and power-up cycling.Yoshi - Shortened effect duration, at the cost of slower power-up cycling.Princess Toadstool - Faster power-up cycling, at the cost of lengthened effect duration.Bowser - Similar to Mario. However, effects he generates have a much longer duration, at the cost of a halved turn timer. </div> "

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys,Tonkin House,American Sammy,"January 10, 1992",snes,The third game in the Ys series developed by Nihon Falcom that introduced a new side-scrolling perspective and allowed the player to directly control Adol's ability to attack and jump for the first time. ,3030-4208,4208,0,1989-07-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys/3030-4208/,CERO: A," <div> Overview : Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in Nihon Falcom's Ys franchise, a long-running series of action RPGs.Wanderers From Ys, like its predecessors, was originally published in Japan on the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 computers on July 21, 1989. The title was soon released on other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000, and later saw ports created for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. While the original PC version was never localized into English, all of the console ports were eventually published in North America. Years later, Ys III was remade for Windows-based computers as Ys: The Oath in Felghana in 2005 which followed the same basic story while featuring the new gameplay systems and graphics engine introduced by Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. </div>  <div> Story : Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two hear rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I & II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points (TGCD) or not (SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights. </div>  <div> Development : The original Ys was born from a prototype created by programmer Masaya Hashimoto that showed that full-screen 8-color scrolling was possible on the PC-88 . Similarly, Ys III began with Hashimoto's desire to achieve a side-scrolling parallax effect on the computer. Hashimoto experimented with this effect on Ys II but decided to take this technical challenge head on in his next game. The title was planned to be a side-scrolling action title directly inspired by The Adventure of Link and was initially completely unrelated to Ys. However, when development first began around the middle of 1988, the game used a sprite of Adol as a place-holder graphic for the main character. Because of this, the game eventually evolved into a spin-off to the Ys franchise tentatively called ""Adol's Great Adventure."" Hashimoto and map designer Seigo Oketani did not want ""Ys"" to be in the game's name since the continent of Ys was not featured in the story but the title was later changed to ""Wanderers from Ys.""Farewell message from Ys' staff that was removed in future re-releases.During the development of Wanderers, Hashimoto's relationship with Falcom's president had deteriorated greatly. In fact, before development had even started, Hashimoto and scenario writer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki intended to leave Falcom after Wanderers was finished. However, around February and March of 1989, almost the entire development team left the company. More than half of Wanderers had been completed by this point so the remaining staff at Falcom put the final touches on the game and it was released as ""Ys III: Wanderers from Ys"" on July 21, 1989. In initial advertisements and magazine articles, the game had only gone by the name ""Wanderers from Ys."" The team did not intend for the game to be a numbered installment but, once the team left, the title was changed to ""Ys III"" for marketing purposes.Masaya Hashimoto and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki would end up founding Quintet in April 1989 and many former Ys developers would help them create various action RPGs for the Super Nintendo. After all these departures, Falcom would team up with other developers to make the fourth entry in the Ys series before returning to making Ys games themselves with Ys V in 1995. Additionally, starting with Ys III, the company went through a short period where they stopped including staff credits in their games up until the release of titles like Brandish in 1991. </div>  <div> Reception : Ys III is often considered to be the black sheep of the Ys franchise by some fans due to its change in gameplay. Back in the day, Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, ""...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game"". </div>  <div> References : Ys I & II: The Development and Completion of Ys III, and One Speculation by Hiromasa Iwasaki (Colorful Pieces of Game, 2019). </div> "
