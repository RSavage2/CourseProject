Alien³,Bits Studios,LJN NA/EUAcclaim Japan JP,January 1993,gb,An action game from Acclaim based on the 1992 David Fincher movie. The player assumes the role of Ripley as she explores the prison planet of Fury 161.,3030-14356,14356,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/alien3/3030-14356/," <div> Overview : With the release of the Alien 3 film several games were released to tie into the film. With the Super Nintendo and Genesis as the leading platforms the game was built and ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64 and Game Gear. The games are set on the world of the film, Fury 161, but the gameplay actually has more in common with the film Aliens, throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player. Whereas in Alien 3 there was only one xenomorph.The video game versions (except the Nintendo Entertainment System) were praised at the time of its release for not sticking with the lack of guns and multiple aliens in the film, which was the film's most criticized aspects. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The SNES version had varied missions to complete.In the SNES version, Ripley begins the game in a corridor where she can operate a computer terminal which gives her access to various missions. Missions have Ripley completing objectives such as destroying groups of eggs, fixing pipes or junction boxes, isolating rooms, killing Alien Queens or rescuing trapped inmates. Completing these missions leads to the game's ending, which is closer to the movie than the other versions. Like most versions of the game, the SNES version was liberal with the material, generating waves of enemies to combat.Unlike the other versions of the game, health, ammo and enemies respawn during the levels.There are 6 levels in total, each having a range of missions in them. Since completing a level takes around half an hour to an hour, the levels can be accessed via a password system.The soundtrack is inspired on that of the film's, unlike the Genesis's more action game music. Complex orchestrations delivered by the SNES's sound chip accompany the game to give it a movie-like feeling.The graphics are also superior, having rich detail in the backgrounds and effects like smoke and rain occurring in parts of Fury 161. Ripley and her enemies have smooth animations and there are lighting effects on the scenery and/or the objects when using a flame thrower in egg rooms or closing a door.The SNES version was released after the movie, therefore it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or scenery present at the time of the other versions' developments. </div>  <div> Genesis Version : The Genesis version was a slightly different case. Instead of missions in a large, persistent area, the game uses stages (or levels) like many other platformers of the time. The majority of these see the player fighting their way through hordes of Aliens in order to rescue prisoners before the timer runs out. When the timer does run out, the player is show a scene of each of the remaining prisoners giving birth to a chestburster Alien. In addition to these rescue missions, there are other mission instances. Every few missions the player must fight a boss alien (and in the games finale, two at once) and occasionally, the player will have to rescue lots of prisoners, without interference from Aliens. As well as the opposite, having to shoot lots of Aliens and reach the exit without needing to rescue prisoners.Rescue the prisoners as fast as possible, before this happens.The game consists of roughly 20 missions, each increasing in difficulty and features several different locations from the movie (such as the prison grounds, the lead works, the slaughter house, the Alien nest, etc) and features a number of weapons commonly seen in the franchise (but ironically, none of which were seen in the actual film) the pulse rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher and hand grenades.In addition to this, the player is given health and battery pickups. The battery pickups allow the motion tracker in the top right hand corner of the screen to work for a short time, but once the battery has run out it reverts to being blank again until the player picks up another battery. Enemies include the ubiquitous Alien, as well as much later in the game Eggs and Facehuggers, in addition to the larger boss Aliens.Since the movie was subject to various creative inputs due to a lack of consent over the final script, many things were scrapped but some remained in the video game, such as the abattoir level (which is present in the recent Alien 3 Assembly Cut) and the fact that Ripley survives in the end. </div>  <div> Master System, Game Gear, Amiga and Commodore 64 Versions : The Master System and Game Gear versions are very similar to the Genesis version, the first few levels are exactly the same but with a major graphical downgrade. The player has access to largely the same arsenal of movements and weapons, as well as having a countdown clock and prisoners to rescue. Beyond the first few levels, they begin to differ slightly, but not much from the Genesis version of the game.The Commodore 64 version follows the same principle and scenery of the Genesis game, but with altered level design.The Amiga version looked and played similar to the Genesis version in terms of graphics but the player had to choose either to play the music or sound effects but not both. </div>  <div> NES Version : The NES version was developed by LJN LTD, and featured a drastically different visual style as well as gameplay mechanics. The graphics are indistinct, the Alien creatures appear to be vague shapes of solid color and the game world itself features a lot less detail than that of the Master System, or other versions. The game features a large HUD which occupies the bottom portion of the screen and displays information such as remaining ammunition. The game's sound effects were also a much lower quality than that of other versions. The game featured a variety of different mission locations taken from the film, and like the other versions the main objective throughout the game is to rescue prisoners on each level before proceeding to the exit.Though seen as a mediocre game at the time of its release, the game has been heavily criticized as time went by. </div> ",

Alleyway,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,"July 31, 1989",gb,A Breakout/Arkanoid clone for the Game Boy featuring a tiny Mario as the pilot of the paddle. It was one of four launch titles for the Game Boy.,3030-4381,4381,0,1989-08-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/alleyway/3030-4381/," <div> Overview : Alleyway is a puzzle action game and one of the four original games released as Game Boy launch titles in the Japan and also later as a launch title in both Europe and America.The developer of the game is not known with 100% certainty as the game is credited to both Nintendo R&D1 and Intelligent Systems Co., Ltd.; the latter claiming credit for the game on their corporate website without delving into any further details. The fact that Intelligent Systems is often cited as having spun off from R&D1 adds additional confusion and so it is hard to identify who exactly developed the game without further information being revealed.Alleyway is referred to as a Block Kuzushi game in its Japanese box art, which isn't so much a franchise of its own than a title applied to any Japanese game that contains Breakout's ""ball and paddle"" gameplay.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players experienced with such games as Breakout and Arkanoid, will be very familiar with the concept of Alleyway: the player controls a small paddle with the aim of hitting a constellation of bricks with a ball. Each brick disappears once hit with the ball and the goal is to ensure the whole screen is devoid of bricks. Once this is achieved the player then moves onto the next level which becomes that little bit harder to clear. After clearing all of the games 32 stages (24 basic and 8 bonus) the game ends.The general structure of the game is that the game is split into 8 sets of 4 rounds with each round having its own distinct take on the goal of clearing the screen of all blocks. The first round of the set is always a simple Breakout clone albeit with the occasional different layout of the blocks on the screen. The second round features the same layout of the screen except that bricks now move horizontally across the screen and when the ball comes in contact with the back wall of bricks the players paddle shrinks to half its size. The third round sees the bricks progress downwards towards the bottom of the screen every time the ball hits the paddle a set number of times. The additional challenge now becoming a Space Invaders like game in that the player must clear the screen of all bricks before they reach the bottom of the screen. The fourth stage of a set is a bonus stage in which the ball rather than being deflected upon hitting a brick keeps charging through clearing all the bricks in passes through. Players are given a time limit to clear the stage which if met awards a large score boost that will almost grant players enough points for an additional life.Should the ball drops below the paddle the player will lose a life, and once all the lives are gone the player must restart from the beginning.The game also features a cameo from Mario who can be seen entering the paddle upon starting a new game, and every time the player loses a life he appears to jump ship before facing almost certain doom. There were a few other Nintendo subtleties thrown in such as the cameo of certain famous faces each time a bonus stage rolled around as the brick layouts are structured to look like the given character. </div> ",ESRB: E

However one night, as Gwen Stacy gives Peter a tour around the facility, the Cross-Species experiments break out, infecting Gwen and a number of Oscorp scientists with a deadly plague that begins to spread about New York City. Spider-Man breaks the now cured Curt Connors out of the mental institute he resides in, being branded a criminal in the process, in order to create a cure to save the city. Smythe begins to send out armies Drones designed to hunt down the escaped Cross-Species monsters (including versions of Spider-Man villains such Rhino, The Scorpion and Iguana), including Spider-Man himself, whose hybrid DNA also makes him a target. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Web Rush Mode, when activated.For the first time since Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, The Amazing Spider-Man returns to featuring Manhattan as an open world sandbox for Spider-Man to swing around in, stopping random crimes, collecting comic book pages - which, once a certain amount are collected, unlock digital copies of famous issues of Spider-Man comics throughout history, including Amazing Fantasy #15, Spider-Man's first appearance - and taking photos to unlock bonus costumes. Apart from web-swinging, the open world also utilizes a new Traversal mechanic called Web Rush, which slows down time and pulls the camera into a first person perspective, highlighting different areas Spider-Man can zip-line to. Web Rush can also be used in combat to highlight enemies Spider-Man can zip to, or objects he can interact with to take out multiple targets at once.Combat itself is akin to the systems found in the Rocksteady Batman games, with spider-man chaining combos and dodges using his spider-senses in order to be able to pull off powerful and acrobatic finishing moves. Through these combat encounters Spider-Man gains experience which can be used to level up, unlocking extra skills or modifying the strength of his current ones. </div>  <div> Voice Acting : Unlike past Spider-Man movie titles, The Amazing Spider-Man does not use the cast from the movie to voice its characters. Sam Riegel plays the part of Spider-Man, with Kari Wahlgren playing Gwen Stacy and Steven Blum as Doctor Connors. Ali Hillis makes an appearance as the Black Cat, and Nolan North voices main villain Alistair Smythe.

There are no actual ""lives"" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to ""try and take over the world"". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm (""air kiss"") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and ""welcoming"" the player to the game). </div> ",

The game unlike it’s predecessor has a plot and 3 characters. Each one of them has it’s own personality. You fly on your balloons through different locations like an ocean, mountains, industrial building or a town called Pencilvania which is filled with skyscrapers shaped like pencils.Balloon Kid was developed by Pax Softonica and published by Nintendo in 1990 on Game Boy. </div>  <div> Characters : Alice – The main character of the game. You control her as player 1 in all of the modes and you have to save your brother Jim from trouble.Samm – Your eternal rival. Player 2 controls him.Jim – Your brother. He accidentally flies away on some balloons when  trying to make a balloon rainbow in the sky. Jim leaves a trail of balloons for Alice to follow and collect. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Balloon Kid's gameplay can best be compared to a blend of the underwater stages of Super Mario and modern day helicopter flash games. The player was allowed to move back and forth throughout the level but the screen would automatically move from right to left, forcing the player to keep moving constantly. The player starts each stage with 2 balloons and can starting floating by repeatedly pressing A or B. If the balloons are popped by enemies or hazards, players will fall to their death unless they find a safe platform. Players are also allowed to purposely let go of balloons to accomplish different tasks. If the players find themselves on a platform with no balloons to float with, they can always tap down repeatedly to pump more air into their balloons. In some cases, the player is only given enough time to completely fill one balloon before having to advance.Most enemies and hazards come directly from Balloon Fight (NES). Birds, fire, spikes, fish (as depicted on box art), and lightning are just some of the things that block your path. There are also 4 boss fights in the game. Defeating enemies and bosses is done by head jumping. This can be accomplished by releasing your balloons and dropping onto an enemy or simply jumping while on a platform.Part of Samm's plan to keep Alice following the right path to save him is to leave a trail of balloons. These balloons serve as the game's collectibles. Once 100 balloons are collected, an extra life is given. In addition to the balloons, there are a few hearts that give extra lives and powerups that give the same effect as the star found in the Mario games, allowing you to kill almost any enemy and hazard. </div> ",ESRB: E

One of the unique aspects of the game was the ""over the pitcher's shoulder"" view, commonly found in televised baseball games. This allowed for a more interesting pitching/hitting interface as pitchers could now throw high and low and batters could hit high/low, inside/outside, as well. Like most sport sims of the time, Bases Loaded dosent feature any MLB licensed teams, stadiums or players. The game features 12 teams with there own strengths and weaknesses:BostonD.C.JerseyHawaiiN.Y.L.A.MiamiKansasOmahaTexasPhillyUtahSome teams were well-balanced at the plate, on the mound, and in the field, while others had particularly strong aspects counterbalanced by weak characteristics. For example, Hawaii features strong hitting and a pretty good pitching staff, while Kansas has exceptional pitching and mediocre hitting.Jersey was famous for their power hitter, Paste. Batting third, Paste had a stellar .467 batting average and 60 home runs. Based upon these statistics (the only offensive statistics to inform player ability in Bases Loaded were batting average and total home runs), he was easily the most powerful and talented hitter in the game. Paste is also featured in the non-playable demo that loops during the intro screen, where he hits a deep grand slam into the center field bleachers.Another first for gaming was the ability to charge the mound and fight the pitcher. Only select players could do this and it was an event that was usually triggered after a player was plunked in the at-bat following their last at-bat were they hit a home run. All in all, this feature was implemented well, entertaining to watch and not overused. </div>  <div> Batting : A first for baseball video games in terms of batting was the different batting stances a batter was assigned, previously batters all looked the same and stood in the batter's box the same way. There are a total of three different batting stances in the game. </div> ",CERO: A

We find series protagonist Nathan ""RAD"" Spencer (voiced by  Mike Patton) as a government operative working in a city called Ascension City, where he is betrayed by the government, separated from his bionic arm and set for execution. On the day of his execution, a massive bomb explodes in Ascension City, unleashing an earthquake along with a radioactive shock wave that destroys the city and wipes out its population. The city is under threat of an invasion from a terrorist group called BioReign, bionically enhanced individuals that were once part of the Federal States Of America.The government decided that the bionic technology was too dangerous to control and issued the Bionic Purge, shutting down all military programs that issued soldiers with bionics. Additionally, the purge required existing bionic soldiers to remove their enhancements. Instead of losing their limbs, many soldiers became fugitives and joined the mysterious terrorist organization BioReign. The government decides to release Nathan ""RAD"" Spencer from his death sentence to investigate the group and put a stop to them. While Spencer has no motive to help the people who imprisoned him,  Joseph "" Super Joe"" Gibson exchanges information about Spencer's missing wife, Emily, for full cooperation.At the beginning of the game, the motive and groups behind the destruction of Ascension City are unknown to Super Joe and the F.S.A., though the terrorist group BioReign is held in high suspicion. Agreeing to help the F.S.A. with an investigation, Spencer is launched into the heart of the city separate from his bionic arm. After finding his arm and putting it on, he dives into the city to investigate the cause of the explosion. A few encounters with hostile combatants have reaffirmed previous suspicions, and Spencer's investigation quickly turns into a single-man operation against a bionically-enhanced army.Throughout the game, Spencer finds a large number of relays that provide a few pieces of the game's backstory as well as profile information on Nathan Spencer. Beyond disabling minefields, hacking relays also allow Super Joe and the government to keep an eye on Spencer's current position. Spencer is reluctant to the idea, but revealing his current position would help the government drop insertion pods with heavy-duty equipment (shotguns, grenade launchers, etc.). The thought additional equipment causes Spencer to quickly rescind his previous statements.Jayne ""Mag"" MagdaleneAlong the way, Spencer runs into  Jayne ""Mag"" Magdalene, another bionic soldier whose enhancement is bionic leggings. Their brief encounter shows that Mag has defected to BioReign's side, though their reunion is cut off by the shot of a mysterious sniper sent to watch over Spencer. Then, he is given task of finding a crashed F.S.A. plane in hopes of recovering its video data. After recovering the data, navigating to the top of the F.S.A. and uploading the video, he engages in combat against a Buraq helicopter. Successful in his fight, Spencer jumps off the building and into the city's underground tunnels.In the middle of his tunnel excursion, Spencer is given the new task of retrieving an item known as the Carrion Device inside the Federal Archives Building. The Carrion Device, an important part of Project Vulture, was a secret government project created as a countermeasure against bionic technology, should the time ever come to use it. However, the decoded video data retrieved from the crashed F.S.A. plane have shown BioReign's interest in the device. Despite the Secretary of Defense's hatred of bionically-enhanced people, he has no choice but to entrust the location and care of the device to Spencer, who quickly races to its hiding spot. Unfortunately, his arrival at the Federal Archives Building is also met with BioReign's arrival. After disposing of all the soldiers, he secures the device and heads into the underground tunnels once again.The MoholeThis time, Spencer comes across the  Mohole, a mechanical worm responsible for digging the tunnels beneath Ascension City for BioReign. After emerging from the ground, he engages in a grueling fight with the Mohole in a vacant parking lot. Spencer eventually wins and gains access to yet another tunnel leading to Port Anderson, the evacuation spot for both the Carrion Device and himself. Yet, Port Anderson proves to be a tricky endeavor for the bionic commando; among the thunderstorm and night, he also has to contend with numerous BioReign operatives and improved versions of Biomechs. Spencer tries to keep contact with Super Joe only to receive static on the other end, supposedly due to interference by the lightning.Eventually, Spencer reaches Super Joe and proceeds to hand over the device. In another unfortunate turn of events, it ends up that Super Joe has been collaborating with BioReign from the start. Additionally, BioReign is also led by  Gottfried Groeder, who supposedly died during the crash of the Albatross ten years ago. After taking the device, Super Joe and Groeder attempt to dispose of Spencer, hold Mag captive and head off to activate Project Vulture. Though Spencer would not be easily killed off, as he manages to stealthily land atop one of the enemy's Buraq helicopters. He skillfully traverses the Buraq armada and made his way into the helicopter that housed Super Joe. Despite all this, Spencer abandons his chance to get the Carrion Device as Mag falls out of the helicopter and he decides to jump after her.Joseph ""Super Joe"" GibsonThe daredevil jump lands them in a crevice and in the wake of the Constructor, BioReign's transportable headquarters. Aware the final battle is near, the mysterious sniper from before comes forth as a man only known as Silver. After exchanging very few words, Spencer leaves Mag and Silver behind and finds a way into the Constructor. There, he disables the cooling system and encounters Groeder for a nostalgic showdown; Spencer disposes Groeder and heads to the site of Project Vulture to stop Super Joe. At the site of a former T.A.S.C. lab, Spencer learns that his wife was used as a catalyst for his arm; Super Joe explains that for a long time scientists have tried to get machine that emulate humans, but the success of his bionics program stemmed from making humans that emulate machines.Prior to the activation of Project Vulture, Super Joe kills Mag and takes flight using a bionic suit with an army of Vultures following behind. Spencer latches onto one of the Vultures and pursues his former ally into the sky. After disposing of a few Vultures, he encounters Super Joe and kills him, thus disabling the entirety of Project Vulture. With nothing to latch his arm onto, Spencer falls from the sky and the game ends with no finite conclusion. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Swinging.The game's core contrivance is the  bionic arm (also referred to as the wire, the cable or the hook). The skillful use of the arm has repeatedly been emphasized by the developer as the game's primary differentiators from other action adventure titles. Players can use it to get to high places that would otherwise be impossible to reach by grappling and jumping off surfaces. It can also be used for lateral movement by swinging. By doing so, players can gain a lot of distance by never touching the ground. Much like the NES title, management of stable ground-based gunplay with dramatically lowered mobility is a must. Strategic movement is needed to gain the drop on the enemy and maintain an advantage. Through effective use of the environment, the bionic arm may be used to throw large objects at enemies, take cover on the sides of buildings or kite enemies for an effortless kill.The arm utilizes a separate, partially automated aiming reticule that snaps along the vertical axis based on the player's current trajectory and aiming direction. Players pull a left shoulder button to fire the arm and release the button to let go of whatever the arm has latched onto. Skillful timing is an important skill for players to master, and HUD elements indicate the optimal release time to maximize forward momentum.More swinging.The arm can also be used as a weapon by hooking to enemies and zip kicking into them, the player also has the option to throw people up in the sky and shoot them in mid air. Like the top-down stages in the original NES game, the player is able to throw the bionic arm in a 360 degree circle and knock down multiple enemies at once. Most of the abilities are taught during the game's opening tutorial, but all of them are unlocked at later points in the game. The reasoning behind the  abilitease is that bionics ""take time to sync with the bearer"". Later in the game, an adrenaline meter is unlocked to provide instant kills and enhanced versions of previous techniques.Bionic Commando plays like most third-person shooters in that there's a third-person camera for shooting from the hip. By clicking the right analog stick, there's also an over-the-shoulder angle for improved accuracy. Commentary on Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast suggests the game may have a novel mechanic in place for effectively targeting and shooting at enemies in mid-air while still maintaining separate control of the swing; though in-game evidence does not seem to exist. </div>  <div> Multiplayer : Multiplayer mode in action.Designed by a separate GRIN team than the one responsible for the single player component, the game's multiplayer will support up to 8 players in the traditional modes of online play (deathmatch, capture the flag, and team deathmatch). It has been revealed that the bionic arm will be limited compared to its singleplayer counterpart, but that the swinging mechanic will be in place. Players will be able to attach it to both teammates and enemies as well as the environment. Zip kicks and heavy punches are still present, but throwing and kiting remain absent in the multiplayer mode. Players accumulate experience points from defeating other players, which only boost the player's current position on the leaderboards. Currently, there are no plans to correlate the experience points with a leveling system.There are no customizable character options and joining a game will only randomize the color of the player's character. Even though the multiplayer mode was met with some poor reception due to an Xbox Live demo, it has been formally recognized by Major League Gaming. Numerous glitches such as rapid pistol fire and higher-damage shotgun blasts still plague the system and there are no plans for a patch at this time. </div>  <div> Bionic Commando: Rearmed Connectivity : BC: Rearmed, a remake of the NES game.Owners of the downloadable title  Bionic Commando: Rearmed will find certain features unlocked in their copy of Bionic Commando. Most notably an retro skin and model for the player character similar to the player character in Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Two other unlockable extras include the Purple Matrix and the Prototype Weapon. The Purple Matrix unlocks a specific door with one of the game's Fissure levels (where within, there are models of various vehicles and a radio). The Prototype Weapon is an updated version of the Tungsten pistol, with higher accuracy and damage.Bionic Commando was originally set to be the first retail game to sync with an Xbox Live Arcade title. However, numerous delays and the release of  Fable II and  Fable II Pub Games prevented this from happening. </div>  <div> Development : Capcom Japan producer, Ben JuddBionic Commando's development differs from other  Capcom titles in that its development is a joint venture between Swedish GRIN and Capcom Japan, with GRIN, previously responsible for the PC ports of  Ubisoft's  Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, handling design and development while supervised by Capcom veterans and Capcom Japan's only American producer, Ben Judd. This amalgam of western and Japanese design philosophies is a first for Capcom Japan, and has been seen by some as somewhat of a risky venture. Poor sales may cause the company to reconsider its strategy, though Ben Judd has constantly reassured fans that most mistakes have been taken into consideration. In the future, Capcom hopes that the development of Bionic Commando will help provide better quality for titles such as  Dead Rising 2.Creative director at GRIN,  Ulf Andersson, has described designing the bionic arm mechanic and handling the repercussions of giving players complete freedom of mobility the biggest hurdles encountered during development. </div>  <div> Critical Reception/Sales : While having virtually nothing to do with the game itself, Top Secret: The Bionic Commando Podcast was a large step for a company as tight-knit as Capcom Japan. At first, the executives at Capcom were reluctant to allow the company's localization team to speak candidly every week. Usually hosted by Assistant Producer Gearoid Reidy, the podcast featured guests from many sections of the gaming industry including: Ben Judd (Producer, Bionic Commando) Keiji Inafune (Capcom Head of R&D) Ryan Payton (Assistant Producer, Metal Gear Solid 4) Minae Matsukawa (Producer, Ace Attorney series) Simon Viklund (Creative Director, Bionic Commando: Rearmed) Shane Bettenhausen (1UP) Jeff Gerstmann (Giant Bomb) Jun Takeuchi (Producer, Resident Evil 5)The people behind the podcast.At certain times, the podcast was popular enough to crack the top 25 on iTunes' list of Games and Hobbies podcasts. While having Bionic Commando in its name, the podcast served more as look into Japanese game development and its contrast with western development. The bi-weekly show was popular for its humorous banter, hard-hitting questions against its own employees and nonsensical censorship. It was originally intended as an effort to get the word out via community efforts instead of through conventional ad campaigns; Gearoid Reidy has stated that the podcast may not have done its job while Ben Judd remains optimistic.Numerous bits of trivia have spilled out of the podcast, including the numerous voices behind the Phoenix Wright and Onimusha series. On May 27th, 2009, the final episode of the podcast was released ending nearly two years after its conception. Currently, future plans will be unveiled on the Capcom Unity blog at some point. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Even though the game was distinctly crafted for a western audience, Bionic Commando was met with reception ranging anywhere from poor to average when released in North America. The scores also corresponded to the sales numbers, as the game sold less than 27,000 units across both platforms during its first month on shelves. Sales projections from Capcom in 2008 predicted that the game would sell over one million units throughout the year. Strangely enough, the retail game sold roughly 100,000 units less than its downloadable counterpart, Bionic Commando: Rearmed. Ben Judd took Rearmed's sales as a point of optimism, saying that retail games ultimately sell much more than downloadable games.Despite repeated worry over reception in Japan, Bionic Commando managed to get a score of 34/40 in Famitsu, boosting the potential for an ironically better performance overseas and netting itself a gold award. However, it's first week in Japan was met with sales totaling under 10,000 units. The PS3 version debuted as the number one Gaijin game for the week of June 28th, 2009 to July 4th, 2009 and number 26 on the overall sales chart for the week (the 360 version did worse at number three on the Gaijin list and number 31 on the overall sales chart). Plans for a sequel are looking unlikely at this point.The most up-to-date sales data of this game is a total of 550,000 copies shipped, though amount of units sold still remains a mystery. Despite a great performance by other Capcom titles such as  Resident Evil 5 and  Street Fighter IV earlier in the year, Bionic Commando is heavily regarded as a flop. Today, the game is ridiculed by some critics because of its far-fetched ending. </div>  <div> Trivia : On July 28th, 2009, the official soundtrack to Bionic Commando was distributed as a retail package via Sumthing Else Music Works and as a digital download through Sumthing Digital and the iTunes store. The soundtrack features 20 tracks from the game and excludes pieces such as sound effects or fanfares typical with some game's soundtrack release. Simon Viklund, Jamie Christopherson, Jonatan Crafoord, Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg and José Luis Gonzalez Castro are the credited artists on the track listing. </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : 01 ""Main Theme"" (Jamie Christoperson, Junko Tamiya)02 ""Ascension City Awakening"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)03 ""Desertion"" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)04 ""Flooded"" (Jonatan Crafoord)05 ""Fight Unlimited"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)06 ""Enhanced Tunnel Vision (Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)07 ""Groder's Anthem"" (Jamie Christopherson, Junko Tamiya)08 ""Hero of the Past"" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)09 ""The Laws of Nature"" (Erik Thunberg)10 ""From Darkness to Wonder"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)11 ""From Trash Till Dawn"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg)12 ""Project Vulture"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)13 ""Preparations"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Erik Thunberg, Simon Viklund)14 ""The Molhole"" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya)15 ""Road to Ascension"" (Jamie Christopherson)16 ""Hunters of the FSA"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)17 ""The Gauntlet"" (Jamie Christopherson)18 ""Piano Theme"" (Junko Tamiya, José Luis Gonzalez Castro)19 ""Beyond Dark Skies"" (Jonatan Crafoord, Junko Tamiya, Erik Thunberg)20 ""Adagio"" (Trond-Viggo Melssen, Junko Tamiya) </div> ",ESRB: M

Bonk's Adventure,,Hudson Soft,December 1992,gb,"As meat-loving caveman Bonk, the player battles egg-headed enemies and dastardly dinosaurs on their quest to rescue Princess Za from the clutches of the villainous and tyrannosaurus King Drool.",3030-6973,6973,0,1989-12-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/bonks-adventure/3030-6973/," <div> Overview : Initially released on the TurboGrafx-16, Bonk, or as it was known in Japan, PC-Genjin, was a success and was eventually ported over to competitor consoles. In arcade versions, Bonk would be accompanied by a female version of himself.In Bonk's Adventure, the player assumes the role of the caveman Bonk. The player must navigate their way through five different worlds to rescue Princess Za, who has been captured by the dinosaur, King Drool. In a time when consoles had to have mascots, Bonk was the solution for the TurboGrafx-16. As a platformer it would be held in direct comparison to Mario and Sonic. Although it was a star when it came to graphics, in particular color palette, it never garnered enough popular appeal to push sales of the Turbo-Grafx.In November/December 2006, Bonk's Adventure was released on the Wii's Virtual Console. It is currently available for 600 Nintendo Points and supports all controller types. It was also added to the PlayStation Network store in 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Bonk's weapon is his large head, which can be used to defeat the various prehistoric enemies that stand in his way. While on the ground, Bonk smashes his head forward. In the air the headbutt creates a spin that, by pressing the button repeatedly, can slow Bonk's descent. Bonk is capable of juggling an opponent, gaining more points with each consecutive hit. The term juggling makes particular sense in this game since each time Bonk hits the enemy from below they pop up in an arc and Bonk must run to catch them before they land. Lives are gained through score, as well as found within the world, although they are few and far between.In addition to prehistoric monsters there are a number of pod-like flowers that offer goodies for Bonk. Some of those goodies are fruits and vegetables that boost Bonk's score. Others contain meat, and an handful are hidden monsters that will pop up and bounce after Bonk.If Bonk collects meat he evolves. There are 3 different levels for Bonk to evolve to. The first level is where he starts. The second level Bonk gets blue tints and is able to pound the ground and temporarily freeze enemies. The third level turns Bonk into an invulnerable, green tinted version of himself. This invulnerability only last a short time. Meat comes in two forms: Small meat will only transform Bonk one level whereas large meat will transform him two levels. After enough time, and without more meat, Bonk will revert back to his original self. </div>  <div> Levels : There are 5 levels in Bonk's Adventure. Each has a number of sub-level to complete that basically requires Bonk to move to the right, jump over enemies and avoid pits and traps. Occasionally there would be doors for Bonk to enter, which would result in a mini-game. These mini-games include a vertical drop where the challenge is for Bonk to spin and eventually land on his feet; a challenge to headbutt rocks of lava that come out of a volcano, and a jumping challenge where Bonk bounces from flower to flower trying to collect the most fruit without falling into the pits below. After completing the mini-game Bonk is dropped back into the world he came from in the exact state he left it. After 8 mini-levels Bonk encounters a boss by hopping in a bizarre dinosaur skull elevator. </div>  <div> Bosses : In total there are six different bosses in the game, four of which are being controlled by King Drool. Each boss wears some sort of headgear which Bonk must destroy by headbutting it until it breaks. </div>  <div> Items : Huey, the game's first boss.Huey is one of the enemies being brainwashed by King Drool. He blows bubbles as an attack, and requires fifteen hits to beat. After a few hits, the brainwashing helmet is damaged and on the fifteenth blow is subdued.""Gee Wiz!! Thanks!! I feel a lot better. I'm your new friend. Arf Arf Arf!!"" </div>  <div> PS Vita Compatibility : Gladdis has the ability to create a clone of herself, after which Bonk must attack the real Gladdis with a head stomp. The imaginary Gladdis will jump around and throw stars, but Bonk will pass seamlessly through her. In the next phase of her pattern, Gladdis returns to a single form and teleports around the screen, shooting stars at Bonk.""You're my hero!! You've won my heart and mind, Bonk!!"" </div> ",CERO: A

When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a characterwhales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out. </div>  <div> Powerups : There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level.

It was first published by ERE Informatique in its home country before being localized for the rest of Europe and North America by Infogrames (which would also absorb ERE Informatique) for various other home computers, like the C64, DOS and Commodore Amiga. It would also be adapted for the Nintendo Game Boy by Japanese developers Opera House the following year, which was released worldwide by FCI (Europe/NA) and Pony Canyon (Japan).The goal of the game is to escort a bubble from one side of the screen to the other. The player, as a ghost, is able to float around to any side of the bubble and blow at it to move it around the mansion. The ghost cannot interact with any other objects, except to blow on them; for instance, it can blow out a candle that would otherwise pop the bubble with its heat. By navigating the bubble around all the traps on the screen, some of which work unexpectedly, the player can move ahead. If the bubble pops, the ghost gives the player an angry look and they lose a life.The Game Boy port was scored by future prominent video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto. It was his first solo project. </div> ",

It had different names on each platform; Burai Fighter on the NES, Burai Fighter Deluxe on the Game Boy and Burai Fighter Color in Japan and Space Marauder in the US on the Game Boy Color. The game has two different types of game play levels, described below. </div>  <div> Story : In Burai Fighter the player controls a nameless hero whose mission is to defeat the Burai and destroy their seven bases. The Burai are a race of super-brains, who for thousands of years have been trying to take over the universe. They can’t do it alone however so they have been busy creating armies of robo-mutants. They produce these monsters at their manufacturing bases, which of course must be destroyed. The protagonist has to face the five Burai: Giganticrab, Jawsipede, Fangskull, Torchwing and finally Slimdragon. They'll have an arsenal of weapons and their proton pack to aid them but even then, it’ll be a challenge. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling shooter that is unique from many other shooters for a variety of reasons. Burai Fighter is unlike most shooters as the game doesn’t just scroll from one side to the other, it often changes directions and takes different paths. Not all of the game’s levels are side-scrolling though: a few of the levels of played from the top-down perspective with the objective being to try to find a base and destroy it.Before starting these levels the player is given a map showing where they are and where the base is; yes, like a mall map. The game is unique from most other shooters in the fact that the player can freely touch any wall without being damaged. In fact it’s encouraged as there are many hidden rooms with goodies in them. When stumbling upon one, the camera changes path and moves into the room briefly then, once it’s scrolled all the way through, begins making its way back to the main path.The HUD shows the score, lives, current weapon, how many upgrades of that weapon have been picked up as well as a bar that fills up whenever ""Cobalt Bombs"" are found. The Cobalt Bombs are sometimes dropped by enemies and if the player can fill said bar, they will attain an extra life. The player can also press the A button if the bar is somewhat filled to do a special attack which clears everything off the screen. As the game progresses there will be weapon upgrades that flash between the three possible weapons. The player can continue to pick them up until that specific weapon upgrades to a better version. The first upgrade will occur when five are collected and the last upgrade with ten. </div>  <div> Weapon Details : Starter Weapon: The typical weapon, like any in any other shooter. The starter weapon shoots bullets the length of the screen.Laser: The Laser can be compared to the starting weapon in that it shoots a straight line and goes the distance of the screen until hitting an obstacle. At the first weapon change it shoots two beams, one in the direction the player's aiming and another in the opposite direction. The last upgrade allows the player to shoot four laser beams in an X pattern.Ring: When using the Ring the player shoots a circular disc that can go through walls; the starter weapon also shoots when using the Ring. The first upgrade shoots rings the direction the player's aiming and the opposite direction. The last upgrade makes the player shoot a disc in the opposite direction they're aiming and a spread of three rings the direction they're aiming.Missile: The Missile is similar to the Ring in that when shot, it'll also shoot the starter weapon. The missile however always shoots forward, even if the player is aiming in a different direction. The first upgrade makes missiles shoot to the left and to the right. The final upgrade shoots missiles in every central direction; up, down, left and right. </div> ",ESRB: E

Players reprise the role of Christopher as he travels through five castles in order to confront Dracula and rescue his son.The game was later included in the 2019 digital compilation Castlevania Anniversary Collection for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Refined from its predecessor, Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge features smoother control and more well thought-out level design.In this go round, Christopher covers slightly more ground with his jumps, and it seems as if it's easier for the player to land successful jumps. Moreover, the levels seem to have been designed with jumps that are more reasonable for a man of Christopher's athleticism (or lack thereof) to land.Christopher also walks faster, and while ""lumbering"" is still an apt adjective for him (or any 8-bit Belmont for that matter), the game feels far more akin to a traditional NES Castlevania title than did its predecessor. Christopher is still slow to climb the ropes used for vertical progress (as did its predecessor, this game lacks stairs), but can now slide quickly down those ropes if the player holds down the ""A"" button while climbing down. This is not only a convenience but also a necessary mechanic for avoiding moving spike walls while on a rope.Christopher retains the twice-upgradeable whip (normal to chain to chain-fireball), but no longer loses his upgrade when hit by any enemy (though there are specific enemy attacks may downgrade his whip a level). The chain whip is twice as powerful as the normal whip; each fireball does the same damage as a normal whip strike.Sub-weapons make an appearance here as well. They are limited to the Axe and Holy Water, but already these are useful additions to Christopher's arsenal and give the player a few more options to tinker with, further separating Belmont's Revenge from the previous game in the series.Accordingly, hearts do the traditional Castlevania job of serving as ammunition for these sub-weapons. Coins make their return here from the previous game, with the Castlevania staple of pot roast serving as the standard health-replenishment item. 1-ups can also be found on occasion. Hearts, coins, and sub-weapons are found in candles, with pot roast and 1-ups being hidden in destructible walls throughout the game's levels. </div>  <div> Progress : As mentioned above, Christopher can elect the order in which he tackles the first four stages of the game. They are the Crystal Palace; Sky Palace; Plant Palace; and Rock Palace. As their names would imply, each level carries with it its own theme and hazards. Each of these levels is largely linear, though there are limited instances where the player can choose between one of two different paths through a small portion of the level. Capping off each of these levels is a boss enemyAfter the initial four bosses have been defeated, Dracula's Castle surfaces in the center of the stage select screen. At this point, Christopher is launched into a completely linear portion of the game that mimics the first Castlevania on NES: Each individual level represents a different area of Dracula's Castle as Christopher battles to the spire.When Christopher loses all of his lives, he is afforded unlimited continues. Using a continue will drop him at a mid-level checkpoint if he's reached far enough, and the player is also are afforded a password in case they want to pick up Christopher's adventure at a later time. Progression is therefore much more forgiving in this game than its predecessor. </div> ",

However, different areas are restricted until a special ability is acquired that allows passage to the new area or bypass the obstacle blocking the way. Alucard will level up by gaining experience from defeated monsters, which can done away with by using many different weapons and spells found in the game. Different weapons can mean different abilities or different approaches to the many enemies found in the game. </div> ",ESRB: T

He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game. </div> ",

Contra III: The Alien Wars,Factor 5,Konami,October 1994,gb,Players control either Jimbo or Sully as they destroy aliens in this fast-paced shooter.,3030-3016,3016,0,1992-02-28,https://www.giantbomb.com/contra-iii-the-alien-wars/3030-3016/," <div> Overview : Contra III: The Alien Wars (Contra Spirits in Japan and Super Probotector: Alien Rebels in Europe) is a 1992 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game developed and published by Konami. It is the third console iteration of Contra, hence the title ""Contra III"". Originally, Contra Force was planned to be released first, but it ended up being released afterward.  In 1994, the game was ported to the Game Boy by Factor 5. It featured numerous differences, such as the removal of the ability to hold two weapons simultaneously. In 2002, the game was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX. The two top-down levels were cut out and replaced with stages from Contra: Hard Corps. The game was also ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. Contra III: The Alien Wars is also one of the few games to be on the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games.In the game's story, the year is 2636. Aliens are once again invading, so it's up to Bill Rizer and Lance Bean to beat sweet justice into the aliens. In the American version of the game, Bill and Lance are named Jimbo and Sully. Since the original NES Contra games take place in modern times, Jimbo and Sully are explained to be Bill and Lance's descendants. In the European version of the game, they were considered cyborgs named RD008 and RC011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : A mutated turtle creature, and the first bossContra III: The Alien Wars is a traditional Contra title. It has fast-paced, gritty, old-school action. Contra III is the first game in the Contra series to allow the player to hold two weapons, making it a landmark title in the franchise. In addition to that change, the power of the Super Nintendo allowed for larger, more detailed sprites and much more complex level design. Players can now jump on bars and climb on them monkey-bar style, climb walls and ladders, destroy various objects (such as the car right in front of the player in the very first level), and vehicles (such as a tank in the first level). New levels include one in which the player must jump between missiles while destroying an enemy ship, riding on a motorcycle while speeding down a road, riding on a jet ski, and two Mode 7 top-down levels.In the Mode 7 levels, the player controls the view using the two shoulder buttons (R and L). By pressing these buttons, the camera rotates around. At the start of the stage, the player gets to choose where to be dropped in. Navigating around the area and destroying various targets eventually leads the player to a boss, which must be disposed of in a fashion similar to the 2D side-scrolling bosses. </div>  <div> Weapons : If the Contra series has been known for anything, it's the wide variety of weapon power-ups available to the player. The letter next to each weapon in parenthesis detonates which lettered power-up awards the weapon to the player. By tapping the X button (standard controls), the player can swap between two weapon slots. If killed, only the weapon in the current slot will be taken away from the player as a penalty. Note that tapping X while shooting will rapidly switch weapons, allowing the player to fire anything twice as fast (within the physical limits of the player in question). Also, holding both shoulder buttons and pressing fire will result in a spinning attack with both equipped weapons being fired 360 degrees.Machine Gun (N/A) - The starting weapon of Contra III. Has a high rate of fire, but only shoots in one direction and has very low damage.Spread Shot (S) - Essentially the shotgun of the game. Fires out five weak shots that shoot out in five directions in front of the shooter. Excellent for clearing out crowds of foes and does good damage to bosses at close range. Not nearly as overpowered as in previous games in the series.Homing Missiles (H) - Weak missiles that seek out enemy targets.Laser (L) - A powerful gun that fires out one shot in side-scrolling levels, but turns into a continuous beam when in a top-down level. Takes down bosses with great speed.Shield (B) - Gives the player temporary invincibility to everything except for falling off the screen.Bomb (has the appearance of a bomb) - Sends out a circular wave of destruction that slowly spreads over the entire screen. Damages bosses and will instantly destroy most normal enemies. After each death, players will respawn with one bomb, and more can be obtained as weapon pickups.Crush Missile (C) - With the exception of the bomb, the strongest weapon in the game. It has short range, but incredible splash damage to compensate. When paired with another Crush Missile, it can take down bosses faster than any other weapon.Flame (F) - A flamethrower. Short range but can pass through barriers, making it ideal for certain situations. Also, when holding the fire button and switching the direction of fire, the flame will move in a waving pattern instead of snapping to the new direction like other weapons, providing a wider range of fire. </div>  <div> Mode 7 : Contra III: The Alien Wars made use of the Mode 7 graphics mode of the Super Nintendo throughout the game. An example of its use within the game is within the first stage as the low-flying plane which appears mid-stage forms part of the background layer and is animated using Mode 7 (as it comes towards the player its size increases while its wings bank slightly). The bombs which it drops however are sprites.A second example would be the turtle boss at the end of the first stage which also sits in the background but its moving legs and the bullets that it fires are sprites. </div> ",CERO: A

It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of ""spots"" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. ""Spots"" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game. </div> ",

Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf,Ocean,Malibu Games NAOcean Software EU,February 1995,gb,"A top-down isometric helicopter shoot 'em up originally for the Sega Genesis, which was later ported to a variety of platforms. It is best known for its open-ended mission design and was followed by several sequels.",3030-1,1,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/desert-strike-return-to-the-gulf/3030-1/," <div> Overview : Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems. </div>  <div> Story : A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the ""Madman"" himself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive. </div>  <div> Ports : Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Based on the Dick Tracy franchise, the game picks up after the end of the NES game, with Big Boy breaking out of prison and plotting his revenge on Tracy. Eschewing the open world and investigation aspects of its predecessor, this game offers a simpler, more linear experience, focused on action and platforming. </div>  <div> Story : The game starts some time after the Dick Tracy NES game, with The City at peace as mob kingpin Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice is locked away in the state penitentiary after Tracy got him on the hook for bank robbery. It proves short lived though, as Big Boy escapes and a crime wave is unleashed upon its streets. Determined to restore order and put Big Boy back behind bars, Tracy goes after Shoulders, the last person to visit him in prison. The detective finds Shoulders trying to dispose of a photo showing The Brow facilitating the escape, and wastes no time heading for the henchman's train yard hideout.At the yard, he finds another photo, this time of Big Boy robbing a safe, and corners The Brow demanding some answers. The Brow claims the photos were all taken by Pruneface, who was blackmailing them. And ominously, he suggests there are more photos, some of which should worry Tracy himself. Mulling over the mobsters words, Tracy heads to the Harbor to track down the blackmailer.Prunceface readily admits to the deed, but gives Tracy something else to think about with a photo of hitman Flattop at the Club Ritz... together with Tracy's true love Tess Trueheart. Worried, Tracy rushes to the Ritz. As he corners Flattop, the gangster gloats as Tracy sees the final photo - Big Boy posing with a captured Tess - and reveals it was all a ruse to lure him into a trap.Now faced with with the full force of Big Boy's gang, Tracy fights his way to the drawbridge gearhouse the kingpin is holding Tess in. After a long battle, Tracy is victorious, and Big Boy breaks down in front of him, offering riches and pleading for mercy. Furious, Tracy instead sends him flying into the river. The game ends with Tess and Tracy embracing under the moonlight, and Tess suggesting the two go out for chili. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Game Boy Dick Tracy is a linear side-scrolling action platformer. Lacking the open world and investigation aspects of the NES game, it instead offers more complex level design due to the addition of vertical scrolling. It keeps the inventory system of its predecessor, but as items are far more common, resource management is rarely an issue. Other changes that contribute to a generally lower degree of difficulty include extra lives and frequent checkpoints, unlimited continues, and no penalties for shooting unarmed opponents.A mechanic new to the game is the collection of photo pieces, heavily tied in to the game's storyline. There are 12 of them in each levels except the last, both hidden in the environment and dropped by enemies. Once Tracy has defeated the level's boss, he 2 minutes to piece them together, and can gain extra health, bonus time and additional lives depending on how many pieces are in their correct place.Tracy starts out with 5 hearts of health and 3 lives. He can pick up items found in the open, hidden inside crates or dropped from enemies, including hearts, hand guns, tommy guns, tear gas and grenades. </div>  <div> Levels : The game has 5 levels, with 3 to 4 areas each.

Dig Dug,Now Production,Namco,September 1992,gb,Dig dug is an arcade game released in 1982.  The objective is to kill the underground monsters by either squishing them under a rock through the tunnels you create or by popping them using your weapon directly.,3030-2587,2587,0,1982-04-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/dig-dug/3030-2587/," <div> Overview :   View zoomed image in gallery for animation.You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as  Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs  underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath  boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of violence in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a  ""kill screen"" and the game either froze up or reset itself.Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,  Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :  Carrot, Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),  Eggplant, Green Pepper,  Tomato,  Garlic,  Watermelon,  Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a Warship from Namco's  Galaxian.  </div>  <div> Enemies : PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle. FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy. </div>  <div> Legacy : Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many  sequels and has appeared on many  compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the  Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth. Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.

Donkey Kong,Pax Softnica,Nintendo,"June 28, 1994",gb,A Game Boy-exclusive update of Nintendo's arcade classic that includes dozens of brand-new levels with a puzzle-platforming twist. The game would later inspire the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series.,3030-25744,25744,0,1994-06-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/donkey-kong/3030-25744/," <div> Overview : Donkey Kong enhanced on Super Game BoyDonkey Kong (sometimes referred to as ""Donkey Kong '94"" or ""Game Boy Donkey Kong"") is a puzzle-platforming game developed and originally published by Nintendo in 1994 for Game Boy. In addition to featuring four classic levels from the original Donkey Kong arcade game, Mario's quest to rescue Pauline from the titular ape is expanded to include ninety-seven brand-new levels while introducing several new gameplay mechanics. Donkey Kong Jr. also appears in certain stages to assist his father and make progress more difficult for Mario.Donkey Kong is notable for its heavy cross-promotion with the Super Game Boy accessory for SNES. When played on Super Game Boy, the game features an enhanced color palette and limited voice samples, as well as a unique frame border resembling the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet.It was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as a Virtual Console title in 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As in the original arcade game, Mario serves as the player character. His primary skill is jumping, which allows players to traverse each level's platforms and avoid various hazards such as touching a dangerous enemy or suffering a fatal drop. Hammer items placed in certain levels can be used to destroy most enemies; however, Mario cannot jump while using a Hammer. Unless the player is holding certain items which can act as an improvised shield, any damage dealt against Mario usually leads to instant death.An update of the arcade version's classic ""25m"" levelMario sports a handful of new abilities in order to account for the game's expanded scope. He can pick up and throw certain objects and enemies in a manner similar to Super Mario Bros. 2, which is critical for solving many puzzles. The Hammer can be thrown in the same way, potentially allowing players to retain this powerful item between separate platforms if they can catch the Hammer again before it falls out of reach. In addition to his basic jump, Mario can now jump even higher by performing a handstand, or by changing his running direction just prior to jumping. While hand-standing, Mario can also use his feet to catch falling barrels. With proper timing, Mario can execute a triple-jump to reach even greater heights. He can even hang onto ropes, allowing Mario to shimmy across with his hands or spin in place. Mario can be launched across great distances if the player jumps while spinning on a rope.In most of the game's levels, Mario must retrieve a Key and carry it to the level's locked exit. This is accomplished by evading or destroying enemies and maneuvering around obstacles while holding onto the Key. Players can choose to temporarily drop the Key, which is necessary to complete many levels; however, the Key will return to its point of origin if Mario doesn't retrieve it again within several seconds.Other than the Hammer, there are no power-ups; Mario's core abilities remain static throughout the game. However, there are extra lives scattered throughout many levels. Players can also collect Pauline's hat, parasol and handbag in any level that also contains a Key. If all three of Pauline's accessories are collected in a single level, players can play a mini-game to earn extra lives following their completion of the level. </div>  <div> Stages : A typical boss fight with Donkey KongEvery fourth level, Mario encounters Donkey Kong himself, who will attempt to slow Mario's progress with various hazards as he did in the original arcade game. Simply reaching Pauline will complete these levels.At the end of each Stage, Mario and Donkey Kong face each other in a more direct boss fight. Mario must defeat Donkey Kong by hitting him with the barrels that he flings continuously. After hitting Donkey Kong three times, the ape will run off with Pauline again and proceed to the next Stage. A short cutscene plays following each encounter with Donkey Kong; these scenes typically demonstrate one of Mario's abilities or introduce a new gameplay mechanic. </div> ",ESRB: E

The game is loosely based on the 1994 film of the same name, borrowing many elements from it (such as having crime lord Shuko as the main antagonist and turning damsel-in-distress Marian into a gang leader) and using small snippets of the film itself.When  Billy Lee and  Jimmy Lee receive a letter from their old martial arts instructor, they decide to return to their hometown after leaving for ten years. After finding out that the town is completely controlled by violent gangs led by crime lord Koga Shuko, the Lee brothers set out to stop the violence.The game was later released for the Neo Geo AVS on March 31, 1995 and ported to the Neo Geo CD on June 2, 1995 (featuring a vocal-laden arranged soundtrack). It was later ported to the Sony PlayStation by Urban Plant on April 26, 1996 exclusive to Japan. This version includes two new game modes: ""Overdrive"" (which is a slightly faster version of the game) and ""Tiny 3D"" (which allows the player to move the camera around, showing the different layers of the background and foreground to give the illusion of 3D).

Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones,The Sales Curve,Acclaim,August 1992,gb,"Billy, Jimmy, and the whole Double Dragon gang fight for the Sacred Stones to save in the world in yet another beat-em-up.",3030-12741,12741,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/double-dragon-iii-the-sacred-stones/3030-12741/," <div> Overview : The NES version of Double Dragon III is considered by fans and critics to be the best.Originally released for Japanese arcades in 1991, Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone - also known as Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones - is the third game in the Double Dragon franchise. Developed by East Technology and published by Technos Japan Corp., Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone has since been released on a wide variety of platforms, with numerous differences between ports. Typically regarded as one of the worst games in the franchise, Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone is often criticized for its shop system, unnecessarily difficult bosses, and lowered graphical quality. Despite this, the NES version received mostly positive reviews, due to the more direct attention from Technōs Japan Corp.The soundtrack for Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone was released in Japan on June 21, 1991. Distributed by Pony Canyon, the soundtrack for Double Dragon III is actually a compilation of Double Dragon III's soundtrack and The Combatribes soundtrack, with twelve tracks from the arcade version of Double Dragon III. Included on the soundtrack are several of the original songs, as well as some arranged versions of the songs.Double Dragon III / The Combatribes SoundtrackThe Rosetta StoneThe New Black WarriorsJim's ThemeLi's ThemeRanzou's ThemeGiuliano's ThemeEnter the DragonThe Fearsome GoblinAwakening of the 2,000 Year Old DemonTo the Children of the WorldPlay Version </div>  <div> Gameplay : Hiruko, the fortune teller that the brothers meet.Titled Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone in the arcade, this game once again follows Billy and Jimmy Lee, the series' stars. In this game, they are returning home after a vacation, and encounter a fortune teller, whose name is Hiruko. Hiruko tells them that they must fight a mysterious enemy stationed in Egypt, and in order to do so they must first collect all three of the Rosetta Stones. Thus, Billy and Jimmy set out on their quest to recover the three Rosetta Stones.Similar to previous Double Dragon games, Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Double Dragon III returns to the gameplay format established in the first Double Dragon. Rather than featuring the directional based attacks of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, Double Dragon III uses the punch and kick buttons that were used in the first game. Additionally, Double Dragon III removes many special moves, but adds its own, including a throwing move and a headbutt.The shopA new feature in Double Dragon III are weapon stores, where players can buy new power-ups and abilities for the characters. The thing that was heavily criticized about this feature was the fact that it cost actual credits in order to purchase these, requiring players to insert in more coins if they want to buy items, new playable characters, or improved abilities (agility, health, etc). The three extra character duos available in this mode are Urquidez, Chin, and Oyama (all three are pairs of brothers). In the Japanese version of the game, all of these things are available before purchasing them in the shop, as that feature is absent from the Japanese version. </div>  <div> Trivia : Double Dragon III on the NES only gives players a single life.Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in January of 1991 in North America by Acclaim Entertainment, February 22, 1991 in Japan, and was later published by Bandai in Europe. Very different from the arcade version of the game, Double Dragon III is similar to the other NES ports in the franchise. The plot is similar, but rather than searching for the Rosetta Stones, Billy and Jimmy are searching for the Sacred Stones in order to rescue Marian, who has been kidnapped again. Additionally, the final boss is no longer Cleopatra (in the arcade version), instead a possessed version of Marian named Queen Noiram.Naturally, the game is incredibly difficult. The game only grants players a single life (although in cooperative play, each player has two lives). If the player manages to beat the entire game, beating the final boss will unlock two new characters, previously found in the arcade version of Double Dragon III. Beating the final boss unlocks the characters Chin Seimei and Yagyu Ranzou.Players can swap characters at any time.Another new feature of Double Dragon III involves special attacks and weapons. Not only does each character now have their own weapon that can be equipped from the sub menu (as well as using weapons dropped by enemies; this feature was in previous games), but when playing in cooperative mode, players can perform special attacks that every character participates in, such as headbutts and somersaults. Also relating to the cooperative mode, players can now switch available characters at any time, making it possible to switch characters when one player is getting low on health. </div> ",ESRB: E10+

The game is based on the animated television series of the same name and follows the exploits of multi-billionaire ""Uncle"" Scrooge McDuck as he embarks on yet another globe-hopping adventure.DuckTales was also released on Game Boy in 1990. While the gameplay of the original NES release was largely unchanged, the portable version features remixed stage layouts to compensate for a reduced screen resolution.Thanks to the success of DuckTales, Capcom developed and published DuckTales 2 in 1993 as a direct sequel. The original game also received a full remake with the release of DuckTales: Remastered in 2013. </div>  <div> Story : Scrooge McDuck is the world's wealthiest individual. On most days he enjoys nothing more than swimming through the great piles of treasure and currency he hoards inside his gigantic ""Money Bin"" located in Duckburg. Although most multi-billionaires would be content to simply live out the rest of their lives in comfort and luxury, Scrooge is a duck whose insatiable desire for wealth often drives him to the ends of the earth in search of even greater fortune.For his latest treasure hunt, Uncle Scrooge enlists the aid of his three grand-nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie, as well as several of Scrooge's other acquaintances and employees. With the help of his friends, Scrooge travels between various exotic locations around the globe (and even the Moon) in order to uncover five ""legendary treasures"" and become even wealthier. However, Scrooge's enemies have already staked out each treasure's location in an effort to prevent Scrooge from obtaining these valuable artifacts. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Scrooge McDuck - The world's richest duck. The player controls Scrooge and must make good use of his cane-based abilities to collect items and cash.Huey, Dewey & Louie - Donald Duck's precocious nephews can be found in various locations throughout the game, usually to offer hints or to restrict areas that Scrooge can't access yet.Mrs. Beakley - Scrooge's live-in maid and nanny to his grand-nephews. She appears in certain levels to offer life-restoring food for Scrooge.Webbigail ""Webby"" Vanderquack - Mrs. Beakley's granddaughter. Like the duck triplets, she sometimes appears to offer hints.Launchpad McQuack - Scrooge's crash-prone aircraft pilot. Launchpad can be found in nearly every level (except Transylvania) and gives Scrooge the option of returning to Duckburg without completing the stage. If certain conditions are met, the player will enter a bonus round. Launchpad can only assist Scrooge once per level. He also helps Scrooge cross a bottomless pit in the Amazon.Gyro Gearloose - An eccentric but brilliant inventor in Scrooge's employ. Gyro shows up only in the bonus level, where he will launch diamonds at Scrooge.GizmoDuck - Scrooge's high-strung accountant Fenton Crackshell reluctantly dons the advanced cybernetic ""Gizmosuit,"" designed by Gyro, in times of peril. After Scrooge acquires the Gizmosuit's Remote Control, GizmoDuck briefly appears in the Moon stage to blast a wall open.Bubba the Caveduck - A prehistoric ""caveduck"" adopted by Scrooge after time-travelling to present-day Duckburg. If he is released from the ice in the Himalayas, Bubba will reward Scrooge with an extra energy slot.Magica De Spell - A powerful sorceress who schemes to steal Scrooge's lucky Number One Dime. Scrooge first encounters her as as the boss of the Transylvania stage, and then once more at the end of the game.Flintheart Glomgold - One of Scrooge's oldest rivals, Flintheart is currently the world's second-richest duck. In the final sequence, Scrooge must race against Flintheart and Magica to reach the last treasure and complete the game.The Beagle Boys - A bumbling gang of criminals who constantly attempt to steal Scrooge's fortune. The Beagle Boys show up occasionally in the game, usually as guards or to take Scrooge's grand-nephews captive. </div>  <div> Stages : Scrooge's ""pogo-jump"" in actionPlayers control Uncle Scrooge as he travels the world on his quest for treasure. Unlike many platformers, Scrooge takes damage upon any contact with an enemy regardless of his angle of approach. Players must instead rely on Scrooge's trusty cane which can be used to ""pogo-jump"" onto enemies' heads; this also increases the height of Scrooge's jump, allowing players to reach higher areas. The cane can be used to collect items and treasure locked up inside of treasure chests scattered around the world; it can also be swung like a golf club to destroy obstacles or knock objects into enemies at range. Scrooge can even use his impressive pogo-jumping ablities to traverse deadly spikes and other hazards, preserving his tender webbed feet as his cane does all the work.Scrooge can normally take up to three hits before losing a life. However, players can discover two hidden health upgrades in the Himalayas and Transylvania, potentially increasing Scrooge's HP to a total of five. DuckTales does not feature continues or a save system; players must complete the entire game in a single session without depleting their stock of extra lives in order to reach the end. </div>  <div> Endings : Small Diamond: Worth $2,000.Large Diamond: Worth $10,000.Red Diamond: Worth $50,000.Magic Coin: Grants Scrooge temporary invincibility.Ice Cream: Restores one point of health.Cake: Fully restores Scrooge's health.Scrooge Doll: Gives players an extra life.Skeleton Key: Grants access to the African Mines.UFO Key: Allows Scrooge to explore the UFO's restricted area.Remote Control: Used to call GizmoDuck near the Moon's boss room. </div> ",ESRB: E

Earthworm Jim,Eurocom,Playmates Interactive,September 1995,gb,"Created by the twisted minds at Shiny Entertainment (led by Dave Perry and Doug TenNapel), Earthworm Jim is a nonsensical side-scrolling platform game that allows the player to venture through the galaxy as an earthworm trapped in a futuristic space-suit to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name.",3030-11133,11133,0,1994-10-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/earthworm-jim/3030-11133/," <div> Overview : Earthworm Jim is a side-scroller shooter from Shiny Entertainment and the first game in their Earthworm Jim series. The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles. </div>  <div> Story : Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, ""New Junk City"". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blasterJim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping. </div>  <div> Planets : Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck. </div>  <div> Avatar Awards : Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Unique to this game is how pieces are stacked according to their height and brim size, with the bottom hat being partially obstructed by the top hat. Some hats are tall, but have a very short brims (such as top hats), while some are short but have very large brims (such as crowns).The game also received ports in 1990-1991 for the arcade, 8000- and 9000-series Sharp Wizard organizers, the PC Engine, the Game Boy, and the NEC PC-9801.

An enhanced version of the Famicom version was released in 1992 for the Nintendo Entertainment System overseas.Each of the ports have their own unique gameplay changes, such as changing each hat size and score, changing the size of the ""end line"", modifying the ""Sale"" system (with the NES version replacing them with the ""Helper"" system), and adding special ""Fire"" pieces (which burn a stack of same-type hats). </div>  <div> Gameplay : At the bottom of the screen are six male (sometimes female) heads. Pairs of hats fall from the top of the screen, and the player has to stack the hats on top of the men's heads. Once five of the same type of hat are stacked on top of each other, that stack is cleared and the player is awarded points.In some versions of the game super deformed avatars of Pajhitnov and Pokhilko appear in the game as characters who assist the player in removing hats and rearranging stacks of hats. </div>  <div> Hats : Score multiplier increases every 5 sets.Helmet (20 pt. base) - 8 pixels tall (4 px. brim).Bowler (40 pt. base) - 12 pixels tall (4 px. brim).Sombrero (50 pt. base) - 12 pixels tall (8 px. brim).Top Hat (100 pt. base) - 20 pixels tall (4 px. brim).Sorceror's Hat (150 pt. base) - 28 pixels tall (8 px. brim).

The gameplay systems involved allow players to pass the puck to other members on their team and for the opposing team to intercept the puck by skating and breaking the straight line of passage between both of the passing team players.The game gets more arcade like with the super shots. A player if left alone and unobstructed for long enough can charge up the shot causing their player to backflip and shoot the puck past the goalie or into the goalie knocking them into the net for the goal. The next super shot is is a windmill which which is performed when one player is skating behind the net and hitting the pass button when the player in front of the net's stick begins to glow. If done correctly the puck will be flipped over the net and the player in front will spin and bat the puck into the net.Since the game is basically a hockey version of  Arch Rivals there are no rules. Players have special moves including: elbows, headbutts, slashing, and a swift kick to the groin, all of which are illegal in the sport of hockey. Along with with no penalties comes fighting and lots of it; though it occurs at random the players will fight, and when in a fight the player can dodge by holding away from the opposing player, punch and also uppercut, the loser of the brawl falling to the ice with birds flying over their head. Winning a fight comes with a few advantages, the player involved in the scuff will receive and speed boost and the chance to grab some tainted although very powerful water from the bench resulting in a zero time charge for a Super Shot, while the loser will stay sluggish in control for sometime after the fight, and if a player loses too many fights in one period they are removed with an injury. </div>  <div> The Roster : Hit the Ice is in no way connected the the NHL so therefore does not contain any NHL players.""Dicky"" Fontaine""Gunner"" Hall (spoof of Glen Hall)Pierre BourdoirPhil Bonker (spoof of Phil Esposito)""Battleship"" BoydDavid VolekIven Yakashev spoof of a Soviet player from 1972Willy Lindberg Tom Horyna (spoof of Tim Horton)Al GiglianoHappy Goleck (""happy-go-lucky"")Wayne Greatman (spoof of Wayne Gretzky)Reggy MarshJonny NovakPetter Kidd, *""Bo"" ClevelandBob DoverMike Barr </div> ",

Originally released in limited quantities, it was later re-published by Accolade in 1990 (along with first-party ports for Amiga computers and MS-DOS PCs).In Ishido, players are given an empty 96-tile (12×8) board and must place a series of tiles (or ""stones"") one-by-one in an attempt to have all 72 stones on the board, where each stone can only be placed based on the color and/or symbol of adjacent stones. Designed by Michael Feinberg, the game is notable for including graphical contributions by Brodie Lockard (the designer of the 1986 game Shanghai).Similar to Shanghai and its derivatives, the game is heavily themed around the Ancient Orient. Themed on mysticism, one of its features is the ""Oracle"", which prompts players to pose a question to meditate on while playing and then receive an answer from the game, based on the ancient Chinese text I Ching, when a difficult ""4-Way Match"" is made. Its original limited-edition release was packaged in a hand-made Japanese-style walnut slip box.Along with ports released by Accolade, the game received ports in 1990 and 1991 for the Game Boy (released by NEXOFT in North America and by ASCII in Japan), for the Atari Lynx (released by Atari in North America), for the Family Computer Disk System (released by Hiro in Japan only via Disk Writer kiosks), and for numerous Japanese computers (with an ASCII release for the NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, and Sharp X68000 computers and a Fujitsu release for the FM Towns). The Macintosh version was re-published by MacPlay in 1995. It also received multiple clones after its original release, most notably the game Stones (included in the second installment of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack).Accolade also released a Sega Genesis port in 1990, which is known for being the first unlicensed game for the system in North America. As it doesn't use documented code later used on the TradeMark Security System (or TMSS) feature in later system models, the game is only supported in early models of the original Sega Genesis.The DOS and Mac versions of the game were later released for free on the website of Ian Gilman, the game's programmer. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Ishido, players are given an empty 96-stone (12×8) board and a ""pouch"" of 72 stones (two of each of the 36 types of stones, where each type is a combination of one of six colors and one of six symbols). Six stones are automatically placed on the board (where each color and each symbol are present), and players must use those to place additional stones from the pouch in an attempt to empty the pouch.Each stone order from the pouch is randomized (and can be peeked, although this will nullify the score) and players can only place stones adjacent to another under a certain criteria:Spaces where only one stone is adjacent (a ""1-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching the adjacent stone's color or symbol.Spaces where two stones are adjacent (a ""2-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching one adjacent stone's color and the other adjacent stone's symbol.Spaces where three stones are adjacent (a ""3-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching either two adjacent stones of the same color and one other adjacent stone of the same symbol or one adjacent stone of the same color and two other adjacent stones of the same symbol.Spaces where all four stones are adjacent (a ""4-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching two adjacent stones of the same color and two other adjacent stones of the same symbol. This is difficult to achieve and grants a higher score bonus.When either the pouch is empty or the current drawn stone cannot be placed anywhere on the board, the game ends and players are scored. </div>  <div> Themes : The game includes four play modes:Solitaire - Standard one-player mode.Cooperative - Same as Solitaire, but players can choose to have a second computer-controlled player aid them by alternating turns with them.Tournament - Same as Solitaire, but each playthrough uses the same stone draw order. It is intended for multiple play sessions with different players, and players can optionally enable a timer that ends their playthrough once the timer elapses. It uses a separate high score table for each Tournament session.Challenge - Two-player mode where each player alternate turns and are scored separately. Optionally, a turn timer can be enabled that forces players to relinquish their turn if they stall for too long. </div> ",

You will find various areas in the game world that cannot be accessed until you find the proper equipment, and this is where     Zelda elements really come in. You will gain weapons to fight enemies throughout the game, but you can also punch and kick as an alternate form of combat.

These missions mainly consist of the player    sneaking by enemies and through different environments. A level set in Marrakech,   Morocco features a  casino where you need to play Baccarat and             BlackJack in order to gain access to a high roller's lounge.  </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Stunts can be strung together into a combo either by preforming several stunts in the air at once or by performing a wheelie or endo after touching the ground. Performing stunts earns the players a score for the level but also fills a boost meter which can be used to provide a temporary speed boost. More points are awarded for stunts which take longer to complete, for holding the stunt for as long as possible without crashing and for performing as many stunts as possible within in a single combo (with each stunt adding to the score multiplier).The levels in Joe Danger consist of three parallel lanes, each with a variety of obstacles, which can either help or hinder progress through the course. Ramps, springs, fans and boost pads all help by giving either more height or speed, whereas spikes, shark tanks, mouse traps and a horizontal bar all serve to make the ride more perilous by causing the player to dismount their bike and reset at the last checkpoint. Lanes can only be changed at lane change switches which are set points within some of the levels and force the player to switch into a new lane.Collect all the coins!Each level has one main objective and at least one secondary objective. The main objective is tied to the rating for the level (gold, silver or bronze) with the most common main objective being earn a high score over a specified amount. Other main objectives include landing on targets placed around the course (simply driving over them doesn't count), collecting as many coins within a certain time limit, knocking over bowling pins with the player 'ragdolling' after crashing through the air or competing in a race with other drivers.The secondary objectives for each level award the player with stars which are used to unlock additional levels.

These range from attacking certain locations to recovering items and personnel to defending allied units and buildings. Should any of the objectives result in a failure, the player must restart the level from the beginning.

Jurassic Park,Ocean,Ocean,August 1993,gb,Telltale Games continue on from the events of the first Jurassic Park film with this cinematic adventure game.,3030-33851,33851,0,2011-11-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/jurassic-park/3030-33851/," <div> Overview : Telltale's Jurassic Park: The Game tells a story that opens directly parallel with the story of the first motion picture and deals with the plot points that were abandoned after the 1993 blockbuster film ended. Mainly, Dennis Nedry's Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos, which serves as the opening plot point for the main characters to meet. The timeline of the game occurs both within the film and in the aftermath of the incident, and the player experiences these moments in part from the viewpoint of Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian, Gerry Harding. Other characters include Harding's daughter Jess and other inhabitants of Isla Nublar not seen in the movie, such as scientists, smugglers, or mercenaries. Like recent releases from Telltale Games, Jurassic Park: The Game is broken up into a series of four episodes. However, all four episodes ship with the game, with one easily transitioning to the next without having to purchase the next episode piecemeal. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Telltale Games has said to have been heavily influenced by Heavy Rain's mechanics. The game includes slow-paced investigation sequences where the player pans the camera and initiates sequences where the main character takes closer looks at key places. This is often accompanied with dialogue choices, moving between key locations within the puzzle area, and minor button-mashing sequences. It will also shift to immediate response Quick Time Events when a life or death situation presents itself, such as directional input either solo or in sequences, and also faster button-mashing sequences. If the player is not quick enough to complete the button prompts on the screen, they will either be rewarded with another chance to get the sequence right or with a delightful character death sequence, such as being crushed between the horns of a Triceratops or the jaws of a Tyrannosaurus. Not even young Jess is spared from meeting a demise.There are many cases where a failed Quick Time Event won't immediately render a death screen though. Some will only drain the end Award level for each survival sequence.Gold - Complete all QTEs in the sequence.Silver - Miss one QTE in the sequence.Bronze - Missed three QTEs in the sequence.No Award - Missed five QTEs prompts in the sequence.If the player fails a QTE that results in death, the game will reload to a designated checkpoint where the sequence started, this will cause players to lose one award point. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Jurassic Park: The Game is comprised of four episodes, each being 11 to 12 scenarios long. Each scenario takes place in a different location of the park. Some locations will be familiar to fans of the first Jurassic Park film, such as the Dennis Nedry car scene or the Park's Visitor Center, while other locations will be brand new to both new players and old fans. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The episode opens with Nima Cruz stumbling through the jungle, injured, clutching the Barbasol can and growing more and more delirious. Hired by BioSyn, she's been searching for Dennis Nedry and the can, unaware of the content or even about the kind of animals roaming the park. After surviving an onslaught of Dilophosauruses, she's then been attacked by a different kind of poisonous dinosaur called Troodon and there's a pack of them stalking her as she grows weaker with every step. This is where she's almost run over by a jeep driven by Gerry Harding, on his way back to the visitor's center with his teenage daughter Jess. Unaware of her reasons to be on the island, Gerry lifts her into the car and tries to stabilize her so she can receive treatment. When they make it back to the visitor's center, they enter it just in time to miss the sight of the helicopter carrying off the survivors from the motion picture.With the T-rex still being around, they fight their way to save Nima and survive themselves. Though the situation naturally only gets worse as Nima's desperation to get the can to the North Harbor becomes more apparent. Only minutes after regaining consciousness, she draws a gun on the father and daughter. </div> ",ESRB: T
Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues,Ocean,Ocean,December 1994,gb,The Chaos Continues is the SNES and Game Boy sequel to the original Jurassic Park.,3030-16458,16458,0,1994-11-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/jurassic-park-part-2-the-chaos-continues/3030-16458/," <div> Overview : One mission involved fighting a T-rex.Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is a non-canonical sequel to the original Jurassic Park game, and by extension the Jurassic Park book and film.The original Jurassic Park games on Nintendo's platforms were a huge success. In response Ocean, the development house responsible for the original titles, began work on a sequel.In 1994 The Chaos Continues was released for the Game Boy and Super Nintendo. For the new game, Ocean took a new design. Unlike the original games, which were all mainly top-down perspective games, The Chaos Continues was a side-scrolling shooter. It also had an animated opening cutscene for the SNES version. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The version for the Super Nintendo is a standard sidescroller. Upon starting a new game the player is confronted with a menu screen that gives them several missions to choose from. Completing one mission brings them back to select another. Finishing missions progresses the player through the game. The main plot is that the bio-engineering company Biosyn, rival to John Hammond's InGen, dispatched troops to Isla Nublar to take control of the facilities and the dinosaurs. Hammond asks Dr. Alan Grant and soldier Michael Wolfskin to head to the island and stop Biosyn.The game's arsenal consists of a charging stun gun, machine guns, and shotguns. Utilizing the stun gun is an important factor in the game, because killing too many non-velociraptor enemies results in the island's ecosystem being destroyed, leading to the game over screen. </div>  <div> Game Boy Version : The GB version has a much different look than the SNES version.The Game Boy version is also a side-scrolling shooter, but it unfolds slightly differently. Abandoning the mission structure of the SNES version, the Game Boy version progresses strictly linearly. The game is divided into a series of similarly themed levels called zones. Most zones have two levels which requires the player to gather a set number of key cards in order to open a gate at the end of the level, with the third level being a boss battle.Interspersed between these normal zones is the occasional T-rex zone, which requires navigating a maze-like level while a Tyrannosaurus chased the player character. Collecting all the keycards in these levels resulted in an extra continue. </div> ",

Kirby's Block Ball,HAL Laboratory,Nintendo,May 1996,gb,Kirby's Block Ball is a block-breaking game set in the Kirby universe. The game features a world map with eleven worlds of five levels each.,3030-19344,19344,0,1995-12-14,https://www.giantbomb.com/kirbys-block-ball/3030-19344/," <div> Gameplay : Kirby's Block Ball features 11 different worlds, each with their own specific theme relative to the Kirby universe. Each world is comprised of 5 different stages, including a boss stage at the end of the world. Levels 1-3 are standard fare, simply asking players to break all the bricks in the level before moving on. One thing that made Kirby's Block Ball unique is the fact that players always use two paddles simultaneously on levels 1-3, one on the top and one on the bottom. This dual-paddling system was previously unseen in other Arkanoid-clones.Kirby's Block ball also has a few other never before seen features for the genre. In addition to the dual-paddling system, players can also use a well-timed and placed button press to turn the ball into KIrby which would enable them to destroy certain bricks. Some bricks require users to utilize this tactic to destroy them. Also in levels 1-3, instead of an empty void for the ball to fall into, there isa spike floor. If a normal, non-Kirby-form ball hits the spikes, the player loses a life. However, if players hit the spikes while the ball is in Kirby form, it will bounce harmlessly off the spikes with no penalization. This would prove to be a strategy in that players would constantly and consistently try to create the Kirby-form version of the ball to avoid losing lives when hitting the spikes. The first three levels also feature enemies for the player to hit. Upon hitting the enemies, they turn into tasty treats for the player to collect to add to their point total.Levels 4-5 is slightly different than the previous 3 in a few ways. First off, level fours no longer have the player controlling two paddles. The top paddle is non-existent, forcing the player to only use the bottom paddle to launch and deflect the ball. Also, instead of normal bricks to destroy, every level 4 in each world has star bricks. If players can destroy every single star brick and destroy the enemy pacing on top of the level, they are treated to an extra life. The enemy pacing on top of the level is a miniature version of the upcoming boss players will face in the fifth and final level of the different worlds.The fifth level in world is a boss fight. Players fight an enlarged version of the enemy they defeated in level four. Level five also differs from the previous four levels in two unique ways. One, players no longer have one or two paddles. Instead, players are required to control four paddles, one on each side of the screen. Each paddle moves in unison according to the opposite paddle. Hitting up or down would move both left and right-side paddles up and down, etc. Each side of the level also has spiked floors, which are covered by a layer of star blocks.Each boss in each world is unique and each possess their own tactic for defense. For example, in world two the boss is a squid. After being hit a certain amount of times the squid catches any balls directed at its frontside and hurl it back at the player. Other bosses may paralyze the paddles, or shrink them by 75%.Upon finishing each world, players either receive a flag or a star icon on the defeated world. A flag symbolizes that the player now owns the high score for the world while a star icon simply recognizes the player managed to beat that specific world. </div> ",ESRB: E

To do this, the player must sandwich the stars either vertically or horizontally between two identical friends. These friends are Rick, Kine, and Coo, Kirby's buddies from the ""Dream Land"" series.Kirby's Star Stacker was originally released for the Nintendo Game Boy in all regions in 1997. In 1998 a Japan-exclusive Super Famicom version became available on the Nintendo Power cart-writing service. The popularity of the game lead to a full retail version the following year, which was also one of the last games ever released for the system.Both versions are called Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu in Japan, which translates to Kirby's Sparkling Kids. The Super Famicom version of the game is commonly referred to as Kirby's Super Star Stacker outside of Japan. If considering this version as a separate game, it is the only game in the Kirby series not to have been released elsewhere. Despite a large interest among international fans of the series, it has not yet received a fan translation either, as all relevant text was coded using sprites instead of text that can be edited or rewritten through normal means.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Objects fall from the sky in pairs of two. If the pile of friends and stars reaches the top of the gameplay area, the game is over. King DeDeDe's head sits on the right hand side of the screen. DeDeDe is there to make sure that Kirby makes as little progress as possible, and if he doesn't like what he sees, his head will turn into a fist. When this fist pounds down and shakes the screen, the level of blocks on the playing area will increase. Like in Tetris, if the blocks on the playing field reach to the top of the screen and no more can fit onto it without being pushed off the top, then the game will be over. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Creating a chain reaction will cause stars to fall from the sky. In other words, if deleting one pair of blocks causes another pair of blocks to be deleted, then more star blocks will fall from the top of the playing field and potentially create even more chain reactions, which will in turn cause even greater numbers of stars to drop onto the playing field. These star blocks always count towards the total score, and will always instantly disappear if they don't cause a reaction, preventing them from messing up the field. </div> ",CERO: A

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time.There are actually two Genesis versions of the game. The first, released only in Japan, was ported by Namco who also published the game. The second was the standard Tengen version available on other platforms. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch up to five blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Blocks are dropped in order of recency, with the newest block dropped first. Similarly, the player may launch blocks back up the conveyor belt in an attempt to ""juggle"" them to get the appropriate color ready. </div>  <div> Blob Ball : A Klax is the simplest pattern of three matching blocks. Each pattern is a multiplier based on the number of Klaxes it is worth. Four matching tiles in a row, as an example, are worth two Klaxes. Points are scored based on pattern size. The more blocks which are simultaneously removed, the higher the score. Empty space at the end of the round is also scored. After each round, the player may skip 5 or 10 stages, which results in a higher score multiplier, and more available drops. Difficulty is similarly ramped up faster. Stages have unique challenges, such as forming a specific pattern a number of times (""complete 5 diagonals""). </div> ",ESRB: E

Heading Up has the player navigating their way through mazes to climb an underground tower. Going Out is a score-attack mode that has the player navigating semi-random levels. The VS Mode requires a Game Boy link cable. All three modes involve the player (as Kwirk) manipulating blocks by pushing against them. There are two different kinds of blocks - rotating ones and ones that can be pushed into holes. Once the block falls into the hole it makes a path that can be crossed. Later levels have both of these blocks and require precision: any mistakes will force the player to restart the level. In levels with Kwirk's friends their help is often necessary for reaching the exit. </div> ",

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first ""killer apps"" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked ""GOAL""). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no ""lives remaining"" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black ""enemy"" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time. </div> ",
Mario's Picross,Jupiter Corporation,Nintendo,March 1995,gb,"The first digital adaptation of the logic puzzle known as ""nonograms"", Mario's Picross tasks players with chipping away at a grid of tiles to reveal a rudimentary picture. Also, Mario is in it.",3030-6316,6316,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/marios-picross/3030-6316/," <div> Overview : A 15x15 puzzle in Mario's Picross, where the final result resembles an actual Game Boy.Mario’s Picross (known in Japan as Mario no Picross) is a puzzle game developed by Jupiter (with Ape) and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy on March 1995 (in Japan and North America) and on July 1995 (in Europe).One of the earliest games by Japanese studio Jupiter (along with UNO 2: Small World), Mario's Picross is a digital collection of logic puzzles known as nonograms (or ""picture crossword puzzles"", hence the name ""Picross""), where players are given a square grid of tiles (5x5, 10x10, or 15x15) and must create a rudimentary picture by determining which tiles to darken (or ""chisel away"") based on the numerical clues of each row and column. Guiding them is the titular Nintendo mascot Mario, dressed as an archaeologist.As the earliest digital adaptation of the nonogram puzzle, Mario's Picross includes a unique hint-based system for improving the game's pace. When attempting a puzzle, players are given 30 minutes to complete it (otherwise having to start over) and are deducted minutes immediately after filling in the wrong tile. Players can also deduct minutes for receiving a ""hint"" (automatically filling in a random row and column), and can optionally receive a free hint at the beginning of the puzzle. The game includes 256 puzzles, split into four categories: Easy Picross, Kinoko Course, Star Course, and Time Trials (the latter of which is unlockable, uses the traditional no-hint system, and uses time-based scoring).International versions of the game are notable for having 10 unique puzzles, replacing puzzles that have cultural or drug/alcohol references. While the game received multiple sequels under the Picross name (including the console sequel Mario no Super Picross and the handheld sequel Picross 2), neither of them received a release outside of Japan until Picross DS 12 years later.The game was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS on July 14, 2011 (in Europe), August 4, 2011 (in North America), and August 22, 2011 (in Japan). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Picross puzzles involve a square grid of cells where the player must determine which cells should be colored in (or in the case of this game chiseled away) and which should be left blank. Numbers along the top and left side of the grid indicate the number and size of unbroken lines of filled in cells there are in the given row or column that are separated by at least one blank cell. For instance, if a row has the numbers “2 5 4”, that means that there are from left to right, a group of two colored in cells, a group of five colored in cells, and a group of four colored in cells, with all other cells being left blank and at least one blank cell between each group.When a puzzle starts, the game gives the player the option of receiving a hint. If the player elects to be given a hint, one row and one column are randomly selected via roulette, and the solutions to those selected rows and columns are revealed. Each puzzle must be completed within a 30 minute time limit. Mistakes penalize the player by reducing the time left. The first mistake takes off two minutes, the second mistake takes off four minutes, and the penalty continues to double with each additional mistake. If the timer reaches 0:00 the player gets a Game Over and must start over. Players can mark cells that they know should not be filled in with an “X”. The game tracks the number of times each puzzle is attempted, the amount of time taken on the first completion of a puzzle, and the best completion time of a puzzle.The game offers a total of 192 puzzles to solve divided into three groups of 64. The first group is labeled as “Easy Picross” and is intended to introduce the game and how it is played. In the initial puzzles of this group, Mario explains the basic rules, techniques, and logic of Picross in order slowly initiate newcomers to the puzzle type. The puzzles in “Easy Picross” consist of 8 puzzles of size 5x5, 40 10x10 puzzles, and 16 15x15 puzzles. Experienced players have the option of skipping over this set of puzzles straight into regular “Picross” mode which contains the other two groups, labeled as the “Kinoko Course” and “Star Course”. The “Kinoko Course” steps up the challenge from the initial “Easy Picross” group and contains only 15x15 sized puzzles. The “Star Course” is only available after completing the “Kinoko Course” and it contains the most challenging puzzles in the game, all of size 15x15. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Metroid II: Return of Samus,Nintendo,Nintendo,November 1991,gb,"Metroid II: Return of Samus is the portable sequel to the Nintendo Entertainment System classic, Metroid. Regarded by many as one of the best action games on the Game Boy, it was a solid follow up to the original.",3030-5708,5708,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/metroid-ii-return-of-samus/3030-5708/," <div> Overview : Metroid II: Return of Samus is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo R&D1 and published by Nintendo for Game Boy and 3DS eShop platforms. </div>  <div> Story : A Metroid attacking Samus.In the first game  Samus prevented the Space Pirates from using the newly discovered Metroid race for their own evil purposes. To prevent such an incident from happening again the Galactic Federation sent teams to the home planet of the Metroid,  SR388, to destroy the species. None of the teams survived, so they sent in bounty hunter Samus Aran to destroy the Metroids.During the game Samus destroys every Metroid on the planet, discovering and eliminating each of the creature's  different forms.At the end of the game Samus defeats the final boss, the Queen Metroid. When traveling back to her ship she discovers a Metroid egg which proceeds to hatch in front of her. The floating hatchling decides to mark Samus as it's mother, and Samus spares its life. The hatching Metroid leads Samus out of the tunnels, helping her escape from the planet. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game plays much like the first  Metroid game did. The player must explore whatever part of the planet they currently have access to until they discover whatever they need to proceed further. Usually this involves finding a powerup that will allow them to bypass some obstacle that was previously impassable. However, in this game it is also necessary to destroy every single Metroid within Samus' reach. Doing so will trigger earthquakes which will affect the level of the magma that restricts Samus' progress into the deepest parts of the planet. The Metroids gradually mutate under the unstable planet's radiation and become more dangerous as the game goes on, so arming Samus as much as possible is important.Progression in this game is fairly more linear as that of the other Metroid games. The game doesn't typically require you to back track. Unlike the first game, you can save at various points in the game. </div>  <div> Graphics : Being on the original  Game Boy the game had a monochrome presentation. The result of such a limited color pallet was added detail to Samus's suit, such as the large shoulder-guards which have since remained a consistent part of her design ever since. Other notable aspects of the presentation are the different sprites for each of the  Metroid's different forms. </div> ",ESRB: E

The game does not follow several of the key gameplay elements to franchises such as Super Mario Bros., as enemies cannot be defeated by jumping on them, rather the player must hit the enemy with a thrown item. In this vein, it is similar to Capcom's earlier Chip N' Dale: Rescue Rangers game. </div>  <div> Story : Mickey Mouse surprises Minnie Mouse with a present. However, Pete, who usually attempts to foil Mickey's plans, successfully steals the present, causing Mickey to chase after Pete. Goofy and Minnie tag along, as Goofy usually tells the player where Pete is headed next, while Minnie offers to help out. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As either Mickey or Minnie Mouse, players navigate the character of their choice through a variety of environments, meeting Goofy at the ending of each stage. Picking up square blocks scattered throughout the level, and correctly timing and aiming a throw will cause enemies to fly off the screen accompanied by a zooming sound effect. The game also does not rely on heavy use of the Disney brand, as each level is either a generic Town, Woods, or Mountain. Enemies are also generic for the most part, aside from familiar-styled pit bulls and weasels. Mickey faces against adversaries that are themed with the current level, as spiders appear in a haunted mansion, and flying squirrels attack Mickey/Minnie while in the Woods.In addition to the platforming levels, Mickey/Minnie also uses a few vehicles to catch up to Pete, such as a motorboat and an automobile. During these stages, the screen auto-scrolls, forcing Mickey/Minnie to avoid certain obstacles in a limited amount of time, while also successfully navigating the level. Certain birds can also give Mickey/Minnie a ride, allowing the player to hop from bird to bird in a vertical progression down a mountainside.Players begin each levels with three hearts in the health meter, allowing for multiple hits before Mickey/Minnie must restart the level. White heart cards replenish health, while cards displaying the silhouette of Mickey Mouse gain the player extra lives. Each level also has four hidden orbs, and when each is found, Goofy will reward the player with extra lives.Puzzle elements are found in the Industrial Zone stages, where blocks must be picked up in a specific order if Mickey/Minnie is to successfully navigate the floor-spiked warehouse.  </div> ",

Despite being affiliated with one of the most well-known individuals in interactive entertainment, the game has performed particularly poor in sales, and is considered one of the few commercially failed projects he has personally undertaken. </div>  <div> Plot : Jinbe's note informing Muddy of his capture.On a lazy day, Muddy Mole, his partner and seven children are relaxing in the woods. Suddenly farmer Jinbe, aggravated over the fact that the Mole family continues to steal his cabbages and create subterranean chaos, sweeps in and kidnaps Muddy's entire family. Therefore leaving Muddy to conquer Jinbe Land and face Jinbe himself in his castle. </div>  <div> Gameplay : An above ground view of a typical puzzling situation.Playing from a top-down perspective, the goal is to advance from screen to screen, each littered with obstacles and enemies. The objective on every single screen is the same: push, shove or throw the black bomb into the breakable exit in any way possible. Barrels and blocks can additionally be used to allow the explosive to cross gaps or as a means to stop it in its tracks. Though the opening stages looking fairly minimalist and simple in their design, later stages become devious and complex fairly quickly. The ending of each world concludes with a boss battle that has a specific theme along with the stage itself. The same dilemma now displayed beneath the surface.The defining characteristic of the title is it's use of underground travel. Every stage has an individual underground territory that Muddy can dig through. Holes can be used to traverse from above ground to below ground. The difficulty thus stems from the decision of where the player digs, as the bomb will re-appear at it's starting point as soon as it enters such a hole. Areas that are inaccessible normally may be traversable underground and vice versa. Later challenges include pipes that redirect the bomb and E.g. spikes that Muddy cannot cross, but the bomb is able to regardless.Enemies frequently impede Muddy's progress in more advanced levels.Furthermore, a multiplayer mode is available where players battle for supremacy over cabbages. The target being to collect more cabbages than the opponent in the allotted time. Cabbages, like in the main game, can be collected by moving them into cavities before the opposition.The game further includes support for the Super Game Boy; Enabling more colors and tones to be displayed on screen while simultaneously adding a custom-themed border. </div>  <div> Trivia : The boss featured in World 7 has a striking resemblance to an enemy commonly seen in the Kirby franchise.If the player continually nags the Elder Mole (who grants the player health in special stages throughout the adventure) they will eventually get a Game Over.Cabbages feature an important role and when all 20 are collected in a single world, a special Cabbage challenge is unlocked where the player steals more cabbages from Jinbe. </div> ",OFLC: G

Mortal Kombat,Probe Entertainment Limited,Acclaim NA/EUAcclaim Japan JP,"September 13, 1993",gb,"One of the goriest fighting game franchises returns to its roots, introducing a new story that re-tells the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games (with a unique twist).",3030-25042,25042,0,2011-04-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/," <div> Overview : The legend continues... from the beginning.Mortal Kombat (not to be confused with the original 1991 game of the same name) is a 2.5D fighting game developed by NetherRealm and published by WB for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 19, 2011, for the PlayStation Vita on May 1, 2012, and for the PC (via Steam) on July 3, 2013.Considered a rebirth of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Mortal Kombat drops the 3D fighting game mechanic from previous games and reinvents the 2D fighting mechanic of the first three Mortal Kombat installments, adding new features such as tag-team battles (supporting up to four human players at a time), an extensive battle damage system (which shows player characters getting heavily injured during the fight), and a three-tiered Power Meter (used for enhanced special moves, combo breakers, and powerful moves known as X-Ray Attacks).The game also features new mini-games (such as Test Your Luck, in which players fight a match after a slot machine randomly adds beneficial and detrimental effects to either player), the return of Kombat Kodes (in which both players, during the Vs. screen, can together input a secret code to change gameplay mechanics and other effects of the match), the return of Babalities and hidden characters (that can only be fought under rare conditions), a 300-part series of special matches and mini-game challenges (known as the Challenge Tower), an enhanced training mode, stereoscopic 3D support (for the PlayStation 3 version only), and an online lobby mode for up to eight players (in which the other players, as avatars in the Xbox 360 version and avatar-like characters in the other versions, watch the fight unfold and switch off after each match).The main single-player story retells the events of the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 3 in an alternate universe. Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use). Players start with one-third (one bar) of the meter full, and can fill up the meter by performing special moves, getting hit by an opponent's attack, or getting their attack blocked. In the first round, the first person to successfully land an attack earns another bar of their meter instantly.Enhanced Special Moves (uses one bar) - An enhanced version of a special move that can inflict more damage, add additional attacks, or changes the properties of the move (such as adding armor properties), which is executed by combining the activation of the special move with the Block button.Breakers (uses two bars) - A simple combo breaker that is executed during an opponent's combo by holding Forward and Block as the opponent connects another attack. It immediately knocks down the opponent (though dealing no damage), escaping further combo damage while giving positional advantage.X-Ray Attacks (uses all thee bars) - Executed by pressing either the Flip Stance and Block buttons or the Front Kick, Back Kick, and Block Buttons simultaneously, the character performs a starting attack. If it connects successfully, the character goes into an animated sequence of powerful attacks (that shows close-up X-Ray animations of the damage being dealt internally). Each character has a unique X-Ray Attack, sometimes using special properties (for example, Johnny Cage's X-Ray Attack starts with a counter move, while Stryker's X-Ray Attack starts with armor properties). </div>  <div> Characters : Mortal Kombat introduces tag team combat (in a similar vein to the Marvel vs. Capcom series) to the franchise as an optional feature, pitting two fighters against two other fighters. Unlike 2-vs-2 modes in previous Mortal Kombat games (in with the second fighter can only fight when the first fighter is defeated), fighters can be swapped out on-the-fly, as well as jump in for a quick tag-team attack. When one fighter is defeated, the other fighter on the team immediately jumps in (without the ability to swap out or perform tag-team attacks). Each round ends when both fighters in a team are defeated. In some occasions, matches are played with uneven teams (such as 1-vs-2 matches in Story Mode where the human player is outnumbered).Mortal Kombat allows four human players to form two teams, with each player controlling only one fighter. This mode can be played online (with teams of two local players) and co-operatively in the Tag Ladder Mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with two Fatalities, which are special finishing moves (animations showing an gruesome and painful kill) that can be performed via special button combinations by the winning player at the end of the match. One of these combinations is visible from the start in the character's Move List. The other ""hidden"" Fatality becomes visible in the Move List either when the player performs the Fatality for the first time or unlocks it in the Krypt.Returning from the old Mortal Kombat games are Stage Fatalities (which can only be performed at certain stages and, unlike most 3D Mortal Kombat games, cannot be executed during the middle of a match) and Babalities (which transforms your opponent into a baby, this time showing a cutesy animation of the baby humiliating itself). The combinations of both Stage Fatalities and Babalities are completely hidden, requiring the player to have outside knowledge. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile also each have a hidden Classic Fatality (based on Fatalities from the first two Mortal Kombat games) that can only be performed if the player has downloaded their Classic Costumes. </div>  <div> Special Editions : The traditional Arcade Mode of Mortal Kombat, Ladder Mode requires players to defeat ten opponents, one at a time, each fight increasing in difficulty (though the base difficulty level is chosen before the first fight). The first seven fights are against random opponents in random stages while the final three matches are pre-determined (first Shang Tsung with his alternate costume and the ability to automatically transform into his opponent and two other fighters, then either Goro or Kintaro, and then Shao Kahn). Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> ",ESRB: M
Mortal Kombat 3,Software Creations,Williams,November 1995,gb,"Set in a post-apocalyptic Earthrealm (invaded by Shao Kahn's army of Outworld), Mortal Kombat 3 is the third installment of one of the most violent fighting game franchises of all time.",3030-1434,1434,0,1995-04-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-3/3030-1434/," <div> Overview :  Raiden decides to take a vacation.Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway for arcades on April 1995.The third installment of the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat 3 revamps the character roster of its predecessor while changing the setting to a more contemporary urban city on Earthrealm. It also updates the control scheme (by adding a sixth ""Run"" button) while adding selectable difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos, mid-fight stage transitions, the ""Mercy"" system, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special multiplayer pre-match codes known as ""Kombat Kodes"".Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's ""cyber-assassin"" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.The game later received a major revision in November 1995, known as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, that added new characters (including the return of masked human ninjas), new game modes (including 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), new backgrounds, and updated character movelists. It was further updated on with the console-exclusive game Mortal Kombat Trilogy a year later.Along with 16-bit console conversions (by Sculptured Software) for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and handheld conversions (by Software Creations) for the Game Boy and Game Gear (the latter exclusively in Europe), the original game also received a port by Williams to the 32-bit Sony PlayStation shortly after that console's North American release. The game also received two versions for PCs: a MS-DOS version by Sculptured Software and a Windows version by Williams (the latter being a port of the PS1 version). All of the original ports were released by Williams (with the European version co-released by Acclaim). The game was also included two compilations: the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, and the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures: Deluxe Edition for the PC. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  Mortal Kombat ""X"" Control Panel with the new run buttonThe gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a ""Run Meter"", which limits the use of running.Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a ""chain combo"" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny!The game also introduces the concept of ""Choose Your Destiny"", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different ""towers"", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a ""Kombat Kode"") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an ""Ultimate Kombat Kode""). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working ""Ultimate Kombat Kode"" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character. </div>  <div> Characters : ANIMALITY! Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II). </div>  <div> Arenas :  The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)The original arcade release included 15 playable characters (one of which must be unlocked beforehand), two unplayable boss characters, and one unplayable hidden opponent for a total of 18 combatants.Along with final boss Shao Kahn, eight characters return from previous games in the series. All returning characters have different appearances (including Jax sporting metal arms, Sub-Zero fighting un-masked, and secret character Smoke being a cybernetic). </div>  <div> Versions and Ports :  Cyrax (Sal Divita) - One of three prototype Cybernetic Ninjas built by the Lin Kuei, unit LK-4D4 (also known as Cyrax) is sent to find a terminate the rogue Sub-Zero.

Mortal Kombat,Probe Entertainment Limited,Acclaim NA/EUAcclaim Japan JP,September 1994,gb,"One of the goriest fighting game franchises returns to its roots, introducing a new story that re-tells the events of the first three Mortal Kombat games (with a unique twist).",3030-25042,25042,0,2011-04-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/," <div> Overview : The legend continues... from the beginning.Mortal Kombat (not to be confused with the original 1991 game of the same name) is a 2.5D fighting game developed by NetherRealm and published by WB for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on April 19, 2011, for the PlayStation Vita on May 1, 2012, and for the PC (via Steam) on July 3, 2013.Considered a rebirth of the Mortal Kombat franchise, Mortal Kombat drops the 3D fighting game mechanic from previous games and reinvents the 2D fighting mechanic of the first three Mortal Kombat installments, adding new features such as tag-team battles (supporting up to four human players at a time), an extensive battle damage system (which shows player characters getting heavily injured during the fight), and a three-tiered Power Meter (used for enhanced special moves, combo breakers, and powerful moves known as X-Ray Attacks).The game also features new mini-games (such as Test Your Luck, in which players fight a match after a slot machine randomly adds beneficial and detrimental effects to either player), the return of Kombat Kodes (in which both players, during the Vs. screen, can together input a secret code to change gameplay mechanics and other effects of the match), the return of Babalities and hidden characters (that can only be fought under rare conditions), a 300-part series of special matches and mini-game challenges (known as the Challenge Tower), an enhanced training mode, stereoscopic 3D support (for the PlayStation 3 version only), and an online lobby mode for up to eight players (in which the other players, as avatars in the Xbox 360 version and avatar-like characters in the other versions, watch the fight unfold and switch off after each match).The main single-player story retells the events of the original Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, and Mortal Kombat 3 in an alternate universe. Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use). Players start with one-third (one bar) of the meter full, and can fill up the meter by performing special moves, getting hit by an opponent's attack, or getting their attack blocked. In the first round, the first person to successfully land an attack earns another bar of their meter instantly.Enhanced Special Moves (uses one bar) - An enhanced version of a special move that can inflict more damage, add additional attacks, or changes the properties of the move (such as adding armor properties), which is executed by combining the activation of the special move with the Block button.Breakers (uses two bars) - A simple combo breaker that is executed during an opponent's combo by holding Forward and Block as the opponent connects another attack. It immediately knocks down the opponent (though dealing no damage), escaping further combo damage while giving positional advantage.X-Ray Attacks (uses all thee bars) - Executed by pressing either the Flip Stance and Block buttons or the Front Kick, Back Kick, and Block Buttons simultaneously, the character performs a starting attack. If it connects successfully, the character goes into an animated sequence of powerful attacks (that shows close-up X-Ray animations of the damage being dealt internally). Each character has a unique X-Ray Attack, sometimes using special properties (for example, Johnny Cage's X-Ray Attack starts with a counter move, while Stryker's X-Ray Attack starts with armor properties). </div>  <div> Characters : Mortal Kombat introduces tag team combat (in a similar vein to the Marvel vs. Capcom series) to the franchise as an optional feature, pitting two fighters against two other fighters. Unlike 2-vs-2 modes in previous Mortal Kombat games (in with the second fighter can only fight when the first fighter is defeated), fighters can be swapped out on-the-fly, as well as jump in for a quick tag-team attack. When one fighter is defeated, the other fighter on the team immediately jumps in (without the ability to swap out or perform tag-team attacks). Each round ends when both fighters in a team are defeated. In some occasions, matches are played with uneven teams (such as 1-vs-2 matches in Story Mode where the human player is outnumbered).Mortal Kombat allows four human players to form two teams, with each player controlling only one fighter. This mode can be played online (with teams of two local players) and co-operatively in the Tag Ladder Mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with two Fatalities, which are special finishing moves (animations showing an gruesome and painful kill) that can be performed via special button combinations by the winning player at the end of the match. One of these combinations is visible from the start in the character's Move List. The other ""hidden"" Fatality becomes visible in the Move List either when the player performs the Fatality for the first time or unlocks it in the Krypt.Returning from the old Mortal Kombat games are Stage Fatalities (which can only be performed at certain stages and, unlike most 3D Mortal Kombat games, cannot be executed during the middle of a match) and Babalities (which transforms your opponent into a baby, this time showing a cutesy animation of the baby humiliating itself). The combinations of both Stage Fatalities and Babalities are completely hidden, requiring the player to have outside knowledge. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile also each have a hidden Classic Fatality (based on Fatalities from the first two Mortal Kombat games) that can only be performed if the player has downloaded their Classic Costumes. </div>  <div> Special Editions : The traditional Arcade Mode of Mortal Kombat, Ladder Mode requires players to defeat ten opponents, one at a time, each fight increasing in difficulty (though the base difficulty level is chosen before the first fight). The first seven fights are against random opponents in random stages while the final three matches are pre-determined (first Shang Tsung with his alternate costume and the ability to automatically transform into his opponent and two other fighters, then either Goro or Kintaro, and then Shao Kahn). Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> ",ESRB: M

The game consists of eight different levels that players must complete in a limited time.  Levels can be played on various difficulty settings, and power-ups such as nitros and speed boosts were placed throughout the levels.  The game contained several elements that made it stand-out compared with other 1980s era motorcycle racing video games; namely the full circular loops and the heightened sense of  speed, both of which were visually impressive on the Game Boy’s screen. The game required the player to acquire and use certain power-ups at appropriate times in order to access a track’s fastest path, such as by hopping on top of a ledge, etc. </div> ",

Mr. Do is capable of digging both horizontal and vertical tunnels. Apart from cherries, the levels also features apples. Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special ""powerball"" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found. </div>  <div> Food : There are many types of food that give Mr. Do a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill him!

Ms. Pac-Man,Namco,Namco,October 1993,gb,"A sequel to the arcade classic featuring Pac-Man's feminine counterpart. The game is notable for having a variety of mazes as opposed to the single maze design in the original game, as well as bonus items that wandered through the mazes rather than appearing just in the center.",3030-6332,6332,0,1982-02-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/," <div> Overview : The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls). </div> ",ESRB: E

Originally a Wii-exclusive, it was later released on November 17, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring upgraded HD visuals and online play. (This version was originally planned to be a feature-limited downloadable title included with new copies of the unreleased NBA Elite 11, but was later made a retail release.)Unlike previous Acclaim-developed installments of the franchise, the 2010 installment features gameplay and aesthetics reminiscent of Midway's original NBA Jam. (With help from the original designer, Mark Turmell, who worked with EA Tiburon at the time, and Tim Kitzrow, the iconic announcer of the original game, who shouted famous catchphrases such as ""Boomshakalaka!"" and ""He's on fire!"").Building upon the 2010-2011 NBA roster, the game features a ""Remix Tour"" campaign (featuring new crazy features such as power-ups, new camera angles, and boss battles) and special ""legend"" characters (legendary former NBA players).

Since there are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.Trail of fireIf the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become ""on fire"" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.Game TypesIn addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 AI opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard's life meter is completely empty, the backboard's glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the ""paint"". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains power-ups. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.Magic Johnson boss battleCampaignsNBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson has the ability to teleport around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters </div>  <div> Standard Roster : The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season. Unlike the original NBA Jam, in which teams are divided in the Team Selection Screen into Eastern and Western conferences, this installment lists all teams alphabetically. Each team has 3-4 standard players, and most teams have additional unlockable ""legends"" (Former NBA players). </div>  <div> Hidden Roster : Southeast Division.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition,Torus Games,Acclaim NA/EUAcclaim Japan JP,June 1995,gb,"Midway's signature rules-light two-on-two arcade basketball game gets revamped, now with a bigger roster and more features.",3030-14792,14792,0,1994-01-17,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-jam-tournament-edition/3030-14792/," <div> Overview : NBA Jam: Tournament Edition (also known as NBA Jam T.E.) is a belt-scrolling basketball game developed and released by Midway for arcades in January 1994.An updated sequel to the 1993 game NBA Jam, Tournament Edition revamps the player roster for the 1993-94 NBA season while fine-tuning the gameplay and allowing more than two basketball players per team to choose from (in which players can choose their team composition before and half-way through each game). It also features ""Tournament Mode"", which disables all cheat codes and special characters while reducing the ""rubber-banding"" effect in player-vs-player matches.The game received home console ports through 1995-1996, first for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Gear, then for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Jaguar, Sega 32X, MS-DOS PCs, and Game Boy. These were published by Acclaim, and most were ported by Iguana Entertainment, with the GB version ported by Torus Games and the Jaguar version ported by High Voltage Software. These versions include an updated roster (from the 1994-95 NBA season) and new game options (including power-up icons, ""hot spots"", faster game speed, and an injury system).Both early arcade versions and the console ports are known for building up their list of unique hidden characters, with the early arcade versions including guest characters from the studio's Mortal Kombat series (which were removed shortly after release) and the console versions including some NBA mascots, retired sports icons, the American rap group Beastie Boys, the American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Charles, Prince of Wales.Some of the console ports were later used for the spin-off College Slam, while the original arcade version later received a successor with NBA Hangtime. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the ""Turbo"" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the ""???"" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the ""Quick Hands"" and ""Max Power"" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include ""Power-up"" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : Hotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. ""Hot Spots"" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. ""Power-up"" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant ""on fire,"" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a ""Juice"" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an ""Injury"" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional ""Tag Mode"" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

The game itself is usually remembered as being pretty rotten, though.",3030-12530,12530,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/pit-fighter/3030-12530/," <div> Overview : Pit-Fighter is a 2D belt-scrolling fighting game developed by Atari Games and released by Atari Games (Konami in Japan) for arcades in August 1990.Similar to Violence Fight and Street Smart, Pit-Fighter is an early example of a fighting game that incorporates the belt-scrolling movement system from beat-'em-ups such as Double Dragon and Final Fight. It is also the first fighting game to incorporate real-life actors for the game's characters (through blue-screen digital processing), a technique later becoming popular due to the Mortal Kombat series.Up to three players fight their way through an underground fighting circuit as either ex-pro wrestler Buzz, kickboxer Ty, or karate black belt Kato. Unlike other fighting games of the type, the game focuses primarily on co-operative play (rather than a free-for-all, where only one player can remain standing) similar to other brawlers, as more enemies are fought simultaneously when more players are playing.The game is known for its ports of varying quality throughout 1991 and 1992 for numerous platforms, including the Sega Genesis (the only port with a Japanese release), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published by THQ), Game Boy (also published by THQ), and Atari Lynx. Tengen, Atari Games's home brand, was the publisher for the Genesis version and the developer for the SNES, Game Boy, and Lynx versions. The game was also ported to various computer-based systems in Europe (the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, PC, and ZX Spectrum), all of which were published by Domark.The original arcade version of the game was also included in various Midway compilations for sixth-to-seventh generation consoles, including the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2, the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition, the 2006 Japan-exclusive Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures, and the 2012 Midway Arcade Origins. </div>  <div> Characters : Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO. </div> ",

Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition,Game Freak,Nintendo,"October 19, 1999",gb,"An enhanced version of Pokémon Red/Blue, designed to more closely resemble the popular Pokemon anime. Instead of choosing a starter Pokémon, players are given a Pikachu that follows them around.",3030-18673,18673,0,1998-09-12,https://www.giantbomb.com/pokemon-yellow-special-pikachu-edition/3030-18673/," <div> Overview : Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition is the fourth installment in the Pokémon series. It was developed by Game Freak for the Nintendo Game Boy, and is essentially an updated version of the Pokémon Red/Blue titles, with changes made in order for the game to more closely follow the events of the Pokémon anime series.Perhaps the most significant change from the previous versions is the fact that players are no longer given the choice of the three Starter Pokémon (Squirtle, Bulbasaur and Charmander), but are instead given a Pikachu by Professor Oak at the start of the game (as also occurs in the anime series). Pikachu follows the character around the world instead of being stored in a Poké Ball, and its personality and attitude towards the player can be affected how you play the game (frequently fainting causes Pikachu to become hostile towards you, for example). </div>  <div> Parallels to Anime : One of the ideas behind Pokemon Yellow was to tie into the anime, starting from a redesign of all the characters, and even the Pokemon. Gary, Professor Oak and, most notably, Misty and Brock have been redesigned to look more like the characters from the anime. The player's starter is always Pikachu, and Gary starts with an Eevee. Gary has no fan club, however, as he does in the show.Team Rocket is a major player as per the original games, but Jesse and James are now actual characters, using Koffing, Ekans and Meowth. Giovanni, the boss of Team Rocket, has had his team overhauled to be more in tune with his anime counterpart, including a Persian.Pokemon Centers are now staffed by Nurse Joy counterparts, as well as Chanseys. Your character also has the option of getting all the starter Pokemon again, and in similar ways to the show: Bulbasaur is given away by a girl after you defeat Misty because she feels he's being held back by staying there with her; Charmander is given away by some dude who doesn't want it anymore; Squirtle is given away by Officer Jenny for being too much of a rabble-rouser.Most importantly, however, is Pikachu, as mentioned before, and the fact it follows you around. It even goes through stages similar to those of the Pikachu in the show, where it at first distrusts you but then grows to enjoy you more. It also refuses to be evolved if you try (making you have to trade over a Pikachu from another game if you want a Raichu). </div>  <div> Differences from Red/Blue : This game is mostly an update to the games, and a lot of the gameplay changes are cosmetic. Genders, abilities and breeding aren't introduced until later games, and the game is mostly at the simplest RPG roots (see Gameplay below). Other changes are enumerated above as just making it more like the anime, so in the end, the other biggest change is for collectors of the Pokemon. The exclusive Pokemon in this version are a mix of both games, making it far easier to catch them all. Some of the trades have been changed as well, or removed completely (the man who traded you the Jynx in Red/Blue is replaced by the girl who gives you Bulbasaur, for example). It's an incremental upgrade, and set the standard for Crystal and Emerald coming further down the line. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay in Pokémon Yellow is based upon the turn-based battle system that debuted in Red/Blue version. The player's Pokémon are only allowed to have a maximum of 4 attacks. There are different kinds of attacks, such as special attacks and physical attacks. The attacks and all Pokémon are also all divided in types, such as water type, fire type, rock type, psychic type, and should a Pokémon use an attack with similar type to his he gains a boost in damage. The Pokémon are able to learn new abilities; however, since they are only allowed to have 4 attacks, the player must choose wisely if he or she wishes to forget an attack in order to learn a new attack, for a forgotten technique can not be recovered in most cases.Learning new attacks require the Pokémon to level up. Leveling up happens by gaining experience points when challenging and defeating other Pokémon, which can be from other trainers or random Pokémon found in the wild. When facing another trainer the player will have to choose a Pokémon in their inventory to battle one of the opponent's Pokémon, if emerging victorious, the trainer will also earn money used buy items such as potions, Poké Balls, etc. When enough experience is collected, the Pokémon will be able to learn certain attacks based on their type, the attack and which level is happens depends on the Pokémon. The player is also allowed to switch Pokémon in mid-battle if the situation permits it; however, the Pokémon switched and the Pokémon which was switched for will divide the experience received equally should the enemy be downed. This strategy allows players to level up weak Pokémon quickly if done correctly. And if the player levels up their Pokémon to a certain level, the Pokémon will evolve. Evolving allows the Pokémon to take on a new form, becoming stronger and being able to learn attacks that it wouldn't be able to learn before. But if the player wishes for their Pokémon to stay at that stage, he or she can rapidly tap the B button to stop the evolution when the evolution screen sets in.When players put their Pokémon into battle, they will most likely receive damage eventually. If the Pokémon are injured too much, the player must take them to the Pokémon Center in order for the Pokémon's Hit Points (HP) to be fully restored and all stat changes be restored to normal. But if there isn't a Pokémon Center nearby, players are able to buy potions and other healing items to heal their Pokémon during or after battle. Players can buy potions from PokéMarts located throughout the game as well as finding the items scattered around during the adventure. The player is only able to buy a maximum of 99 of each different type of item. Like any RPG, items play a decisive role in the game, some items give the ability to teach a Pokémon techniques, even some which the Pokémon wouldn't normally learn though leveling up, these are called Technical Machines (TM), and they work as normal attacks would do when taught to any Pokémon able to receive such technique, though there are 50 of them in the game, each TM can only be used once, being rendered useless afterwards; though most of them can only be attained once, some of them can be bought in shops and can theoretically be used how many times the player wishes, granting the player has the money to buy. There's another kind of technique called Hidden Machines (HM), this can be used as much as the player wants, it doesn't lose effect after usage, and though they can also used to attack during battle, their primary function is to help the player overcome certain natural obstacles during the adventure, such as cutting trees obstructing the way, or surfing. A Pokémon is required for these actions and once the Pokémon learns a Hidden Machine they will never unlearn it.In order to catch Pokémon, the player requires to have Pokéballs. A Pokéball allows a player to capture any wild Pokémon in the game. Some Pokémon are stronger than others; therefore, it requires the player to weaken them first with his or her Pokémon before it can be caught. Pokéballs are purchased from the PokéMart. There are different types of Pokéballs, and each of them have a different percentage of effectiveness on catching Pokémon. Since the player is only able to carry a maximum of 6 Pokémon within their inventory any extra Pokémon caught is instantly sent to be stored in the PC. If a player decides to switch Pokémon, then they would be required to go to a PC located in any Pokémon Center to do so, from there, the player is allowed to switch whatever Pokémon that he or she has already caught from their PCs to their inventory and vice-versa.Your primary goal in Pokémon Yellow is becoming the greatest Pokémon trainer of all, to to achieve that you have to train Pokémon to take on the Elite Four, which is formed by the very four best Pokémon trainers around, after taking down all the Pokémon from the four trainers you still have to face the Elite Champion to, then, if you manage to win the battle, become the newest champion. To do that you won't have access to Pokémon Center's care for your Pokémon and you will have to deal with the six Pokémon you choose in the beginning against all 5 trainers, it is allowed to stock up items and use them in any of your Pokémon at will, but changing one Pokémon downed for some other with full health won't be allowed. When you beat the Elite and the champion your name and Pokémon will go down in the hall of fame. You can still come back and battle the Elite Four anytime after you beat them the first time, it's actually one of the best places in the game for easy and high amount of experience, and you also receive money out of each trainer defeated, making it a great monetary source as well. </div>  <div> Pokémon Gyms : During the adventure you'll have to face 8 different gym leaders and beat them to acquire their badges, and with them, get allowed into Victory Road and reach Indigo Plateau for the Elite. Each Pokémon Gym Leader is an specialist in some Pokémon type, it's important to notice their type for better chances of counter-attacking with a strong type Pokémon.

Like the large bosses in the early Mortal Kombat games (and the dinosaurs of Taito's Dino Rex), all beasts are rendered with stop-motion animation as model figures (while the small human followers are digitized actors). The game features numerous blood effects, including an end-of-round fatality system.Along with major arcade revisions (adding new special moves and abilities), the game received numerous ports for home consoles and handhelds in 1995. Other than the SNES version (which was ported by Bitmasters) and the PC version (which was ported by Teeny Weeny), all ports were done by Probe.

A sequel named Primal Rage II was in development in 1996, adding a new assortment of giant playable human ""Avatars"" (also rendered from model figures) to fight alongside the beasts. Although this sequel was canceled prior to release, some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) of the sequel have been found, one of which is publically playable. Despite its cancellation, both games received an overarching novelization in 1997 (titled Primal Rage: The Avatars). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Glorified execution moves, known as Fatalities, can also be performed this way at the end of the winning round. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground, giving back some of their vitality. Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final endurance round to keep their place as ""king of the hill"". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish ""dinosaur graveyard"", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, they can immediately restore their character's initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes seven playable beasts (six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions). A final boss beast was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped and turned into an endurance match against the entire roster.Sauron and Blizzard are palette swaps of Diablo and Chaos. However, both Diablo and Chaos are smaller in size. Sauron (God of Hunger) Talon (God of Survival) Vertigo (Goddess of Insanity, unavailable in the GB and GG versions) Blizzard (God of Virtue) Chaos (God of Decay) Armadon (God of Life) Diablo (God of Destruction) </div> ",ESRB: T
Prince of Persia,Broderbund,Virgin Interactive NANCS JPMindscape EU,January 1992,gb,"A 2008 entry into the Prince of Persia franchise titled simply ""Prince of Persia"", this game stars an all-new Prince as he teams up with the mysterious Elika to fight Ahriman and cleanse the world of his corruption.",3030-20961,20961,0,2008-12-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/," <div> Overview : Prince of Persia for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 is the first, all-new Prince of Persia title for ""next-gen"" consoles. Rather than continue the tale of the last trilogy, Ubisoft decided to create a new world with all new characters. Prince of Persia introduces new gameplay elements and a fresh graphical style to the series. Prince of Persia was released on December 2, 2008 in the US.This game was created by Ubisoft Montreal, using the same core team that worked on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. This game is not a continuation of the Sands of Time trilogy, but rather the start of a new trilogy with a new Prince and a new world. The game runs on a updated version of the Scimitar Engine created for Assassin's Creed, which allows the game to be non-linear, yet still allow the Prince to traverse the land with his usual acrobatic prowess. </div>  <div> Story : The Prince and ElikaThe adventure begins with a new Prince of Persia, a wanderer, who is returning home from an adventure on a donkey named Farah with a king's treasure in gold, which he earned on his previous venture. Not yet the Prince to be, he desires nothing more then to spend his treasure on many luxuries, including women and liquor, and carpets very thick.However quite suddenly, he is caught in a fierce sandstorm and is blown away. When the sandstorm subsides, he finds himself in a mythical garden of beauty, dominated at its center by a massive Tree of Life. The Prince and a girl, Elika, find each other, and, in the same predicament, decide to help each other. Together, they venture to the center of this grand oasis. When they arrive at the center, they witness the destruction of the tree, and the freedom of Ahriman, the ancient god of darkness. After being set free, Ahriman starts destroying the Tree of Light and the land is full with darkness and evil. The Prince, with the aid of Elika and her new found magic, take up arms against Ahriman's corruption, in an attempt to drive it back and cleanse the world with light once again.With Elika's help the Prince travels to the four different locations: the Citadel, the City of Light, the Royal Palace, and the Vale to vanquish each of the four bosses. Once each boss is defeated the duo travel back to the temple to make sure Ahriman is sealed in the Tree of Light. When they get there they are confronted by Elika's father, the King, who attempts to stop them one last time. Upon defeat the King leaps into an abyss towards the Tree of Light. A second later Ahriman rises up in the form of a dragon monster and tries to kill the Prince and Elika. From the viewpoint of Ahriman you must travel around the room and heal the remaining areas surrounding the Tree. Once this is done Ahriman is captured back in the Tree, and Elika collapses. The Prince realizes that Elika has died, he understands now that Elika is giving bits of her life to heal all of the lands throughout the game. He now realizes that Elika's father only realized Ahriman so that Elika could live, it seems one cannot live without the other. The Prince lays her down outside the temple and travels back to the beginning of each area. In front of each of the four area's is a tree similar to the Tree of Light. The prince cuts down all four trees and travels back to the Tree of Light in the temple.One final blow and he cuts down the tree of light that you worked so hard to restore throughout the game, releasing Ahriman back into the world as the King had previously done. The Prince carries the huge ball of light to where Elika is at the front of the temple and places it over her. Elika then comes back to life. The final scene shows the prince walking away from the temple with Elika in his arms, as Ahriman in his full demon form flies overhead and out of the scene, released into the world once more. The final trophy/achievement for the game is awarded at this point, it is titled ""To Be Continued."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Healing the lands with light again.The Prince is able to traverse the land, with what has now become the standard arsenal of moves for him. He is able to wall-run, leap from wall to wall, swing on poles, and of course jump and hang from ledges.New to this game however are the inclusion of the Prince's claws called the Gauntlet, which are a sort of glove he wears on his left hand which can smash into walls and save him from falling, though neither battle wounds nor falling end up in Prince's death due to help of his companion Elika, who will save him whenever he is in danger. By using the Gauntlet he is able to slide down walls and even block attacks. The game also features a healthy smattering of environmental puzzles which the Prince can solve with help from his new friend Elika who aids him on his adventure, both in combat and adventure.Unlike other titles, the Prince will not collect new equipment to aid him in his journey. There is no special armor or gauntlet to collect in the game. The sword the Prince begins with is the one which he wields until the end, in an effort to make it a memorable weapon. Players will, however, gain new magical powers which Elika will use. Once the player has collected enough Light Seeds, they can be traded in at the temple for the player's ability of choice. These light seeds appear throughout every level once it has been cleansed, and many are challenging to obtain. The abilities which can be unlocked will allow the player to access new areas once inaccessible, as well as grab light seeds once unobtainable.The Hunter attacking the Prince and Elika.In the previous trilogy of games, the Prince utilized the Sands of Time in order to rewind time and fix any mistakes he had made. In this Prince of Persia, there are no Sands of Time, rather, Elika will help the Prince to jump higher and farther. Elika proves to be an excellent help throughout the game, and has been designed to help rather then hinder the Prince's success.Prince of Persia contains light puzzle elements, with one or two puzzles in each of the game's zones. The puzzles involve lever pulling, whether to put walls in place, or open floodgates. The puzzles are meant to add variety to the game which is heavy on platforming.Combat has also been changed, with a focus on one-on-two: the Prince and Elika versus an enemy. Elika is able to perform combos seamlessly with the Prince. The design philosophy driving the new combat system is to make each battle both more intense and cinematic. Fights are not as common as they were in the previous games, but aim to keep the player on the edge of their seat using intense, cinematic imagery.In tradition of the other Prince of Persia's, the game has great acrobatics.The combat system assigns attacks to four main buttons. Elika, the Prince's sword, and the gauntlet are all assigned to their own button, as well as one button reserved for 'acrobatic' attacks. The player can initiate a combo with any of the four choices, then continue with another. Both timing and attack selection are key to creating larger combos. If the player hesitates, they miss the opportunity to attack. Visual cues in the on screen action will make the player aware of the attack they should next perform on some occasions, and any other attempts will end the combo. These are usually reserved for combo finishers, however, as the first few choices are generally up to the player.The Prince can also block attacks and counter blows. Holding the block button will guard most attacks, but pressing it strategically will create an opportunity to counter. The player must beware, however, as enemies can also counter. The combat system also employs quick time events at various times throughout a battle. The player will need to repeatedly press buttons to push the enemy away or quickly press a prompted button to avoid a final blow. Throughout the game, the player will encounter a variety of enemies which require creative thinking to take down, such as The Warrior, who cannot be harmed by the sword, gauntlet, or magic. </div>  <div> Development : Prince of Persia's development team began conception right as Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released, however, tangible proof of the game was found when, on September 21, 2006 a leaked concept art hit the net. Ubisoft remained silent and made no comment. On January 23, 2008 some more screen shots from the game were leaked onto the internet, while the game was in it's conception phase. Once again, Ubisoft did not comment.In May 2008, Ubisoft finally released two videos of a concept artist designing the Prince and Elika confirming the existence of the game officially under the Prince of Persia title. One video shows a full-bodied new Prince being speed drawn using Photoshop. The other art drawing video detailed Elika and finally the third speed concept art emerged in July, 2008, this time depicting a prime enemy; The Hunter. Those videos may be seen here and here. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The Shapeshifter, relaxing at home.The Prince of Persia Epilogue content appeared the PS3 and Xbox 360 on February 26. It continues the story of the retail game, increases the difficulty, adds a new power for Elika and attack for the Prince, reveals a brand new location, and includes two unlockable skins that become available after completing the Epilogue.Jamal Rguigui has said that the Ubisoft Montreal team decided to go on ahead full throttle with some cool ideas that the team had during and post-production and developed a unique DLC that would enhance the experience for Prince of Persia fans. It was not content that was cut, but was content that was further polished and elaborated on. He continued to say that they had a lot of ambitions for the DLC and that they were filtering all the feedback from the industry and the community of gamers. Players can expect to have a specific experience that will give them more content with superior difficulty and pace. This is one of the most ambitious DLC projects from Ubisoft, and it adds to the understanding of Prince of Persia's new world and characters.New powers away!Elika will be receiving a new power that is called Energize which is a travel based power that adds a timing challenge. This power allows Elika, for a short period of time, to materialize an area of the environment that was previously destroyed. Therefore, the Prince and Elika will be able to access areas previously impossible to reach without this power. There is also a new enemy in the form of the Shapeshifter which is an enemy that takes the form of two of Ahriman's most fearsome Lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter. Though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player, it will requires a particular strategy to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the Epilogue. As mentioned the content will also include a feature called sprint clashing. When the Prince and the enemy are at a distance, the player can mash the acrobatics button, which will allow the enemy and the Prince to sprint at each other and attack. The new area is called the Underground Palace and it is completely corrupted. Ubisoft has listened to the feedback and upped the pace of the game with more aggressive A.I and more complex traps. The content will also have new Trophies and Achievements.It is not necessary to have finished the Prince of Persia game to play the DLC. This content is available both Xbox 360 and PS3 on March 5 for 800 MS points and $10 respectively. </div>  <div> Areas : Prince of Persia is divided into four different areas, each of which has its own visual style. Each zone is divided into six areas: one introductory area, four main Fertile Ground areas, and one final area behind a black gate.To reach the final area, the player must first heal all fertile grounds in the zone. Players can progress through each area as they choose, but are limited to the power they posses. Initially, all introductory fertile grounds must be healed to progress. Once the player chooses a power, however, they can choose which power they want, and Elika will inform the player which areas are accessible with each power. Each power will open up four areas in two zones each. The Prince can freely travel between each level with no load times as each is connected.The areas are as follows: </div>  <div> Bosses : The Hunter, who stalks his prey in The CitadelThe long abandoned guard post of the city, the Citadel is currently where The Hunter resides. </div>  <div> Music : The Warrior, who rules over the City of LightThe City of Light was once a place of wonders, but once it came into The Warrior's hands, it is now a place of destruction. The city was once a place where travellers would come to trade, scholars would gather to learn, and filled with beauty and life. </div>  <div> Limited Edition Offer : The Concubine, who resides in the Royal PalaceIn the Royal Palace, The Prince will encounter The Concubine. The Royal Palace contains a cavern, the Royal Gardens, the Royal Spire, the Spire of Dreams, the Coronation Chamber, and the Palace rooms. The Royal Palace is an area which holds many memories for Elika, and many important areas for the kingdom. The Royal Spire serves as the seat of power in the land, and was where Elika's father sat on his throne, and the hall of coronation, where the king receives his crown. The king and queen were wed in the Spire of Dreams, a place that was said to make one's dreams come true. Once upon a time, the Royal Palace was a place of wonder. Actors filled the cavern, and the lush gardens were truly a sight to behold. After Elika's mother died, the Royal Palace began to lose beauty. The gardens withered away along with the king's sanity, and the Royal Palace is now merely a fraction of its former glory. </div>  <div> Alternate Skins : The Alchemist, who resides in The ValeThe Alchemist claims the Vale as his home, dwelling within the Observatory, where he brings terror to The Vale. The Vale is characterized by many different, wondrous machines, which the Alchemist invented when Ahriman was free. </div>  <div> Penny Arcade Story Book : The HunterThe Hunter was once a prince, who lived only for the hunt. He would travel lands, far and wide in an attempt to face off against the most exotic and powerful beasts. After a certain amount of time had passed, and a certain amount of animals had been slain, the Hunter felt that there was no longer any creature alive that would give him the thrill of the chase. This is when Ahriman's voice crept in and offered him a solution to his dilemma. The Hunter was to offer his soul to Ahriman, and in exchange would be allowed to hunt for all eternity, the one creature that could pose any sort of challenge: man. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The Concubine used to be a beautiful women, who had the ability to trick any man she wanted into doing whatever she desired. She used her beauty and gift and became political. One day however she fell in love with a handsome noble man, and they were to be married. However a jealous women, came and attacked her, disfiguring her, and her face. With no way to return to her former beauty, the Concubine fled, and sold her soul to Ahriman, and exchange, she would have the ability to control all men. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The WarriorOnce a King of a great nation, the Warrior was forced into becoming a corrupted being. His kingdom was facing great problems and were constantly at war, and so Ahriman came to the Warrior and offered him great power in exchange for his soul and servitude. To protect his people, the Warrior accepted, and he was suddenly transformed into a great and powerful being. However when his enemies were defeated his people were scared and shunned him, and he realized that he had become the very thing he had fought. Thus, to protect his people and fulfil his duty, he left and became a warrior at Ahriman's side. </div> ",ESRB: T

The goal in Pyramids of Ra is to clear each stage of every tile, while also managing to return to the starting point. Players can move one tile in each direction (up, down, left, right), although it is possible to ""jump off"" the playing field, as well as the possibility of destroying the incorrect tiles to trap the player or render some tiles inaccessible.  Staying too long on a single tile also destroys it. There is a meter displayed at the top of the screen that, when the player is stationary, quickly decreases in size, requiring the player to move before the destruction of the tile.  Rather than containing a save system, Pyramids of Ra has a password system. Passwords are entirely comprised of letters, rather than typical alphanumeric password systems in games of the time. Each level has its own password, displayed when the game is paused. There are five tombs in the game, each with its own individual levels:  Unis, Teti, Khafre, Snefru, and Scarabeus.  </div> ",

After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the arcade, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk. </div>  <div> Cultural Impact : The current world record score for Rampart is 41,180, achieved by Mark Boolman in Bloomington, Illinois under referee verification on March 28th 2008. </div> ",

He worked on the game in his spare time, and it was first released in late 2007. The original game included just 10 levels, and had a timer that would reset the level if it wasn't completed with the limit. Like most games released at this time, it was free.As development progressed, Labyrinth gained many features that helped boost its popularity:an accelerometer calibration menuuser-submitted level packsoptions to remove the level timeradvanced graphics and physicsAfter the increased popularity, the developers removed the full version and replaced it with a demo. They started charging a small fee to activate the demo, which only consisted of 10 demo levels. Suprisingly, this was not met with many complaints, as most fans felt that the app was well worth the price. This, however, did cause some conflict when the full Application was actually released on the iTunes Store July 25, 2008. This was due to users of the jail-broken version that paid for it having to re-buy it again from iTunes. Here's a quote from the developer on the matter:""I would very much like to make it possible to update to the App Store version from the old version but unfortunately it is not possible at the moment. I am investigating different alternatives and talking to Apple about how this can be solved. My best hope now is to be able to issue ""Redemption Codes"" on the App Store.""Labyrinth continues to ride the top of the App store charts, and has received over 2 million total game downloads since it's first release. </div>  <div> Labyrinth Light Edition : Labyrinth LE is the trimmed down demo version of the full game. It contains only 10 levels. Today, both the demo and the full version are available on the iTunes App Store. The full version runs at $6.99, while the demo is free. </div> ",

Side Pocket,Data East,Data East JP/NA Nintendo EU,November 1990,gb,"Data East's signature pocket billiards arcade game, featuring a simplistic ruleset (known as ""Pocket Game"") and an intuitive shot system that allows for precise directional aiming and trick shots.",3030-2042,2042,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/side-pocket/3030-2042/," <div> Overview : Side Pocket is a top-down billiards game developed and released by Data East for arcades in June 1986.One of the earliest arcade pool simulators released for arcades, Side Pocket builds on the formula of other top-down billiards games (such as Video Hustler and Super Billiards) by introducing several gameplay mechanics that were later made standard (including the use of rotation instead of a free-form cursor, a preview trajectory for the cue ball, and the ability to alter which part of the cue ball is hit for spins and trick shots).The game's standard mode, later known as ""Pocket Game"", has players attempting to pocket all balls (other than the cue ball) on the table with a limited amount of lives (or ""balls""), with bonus points awarded both for consecutively pocketing balls and for pocketing balls in sequence. In addition, players are given opportunities to sink a ball at a designated pocket to earn bonus points, bonus time, or bonus lives. It also features a post-round mini-game where players have one chance to make a specific trick shot. Home releases added the game of 9-Ball as an alternate multiplayer mode.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, the Game Boy in 1990, the Sega Genesis in 1992, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, and the Game Gear in 1994. These versions include various improvements, such as a new single-player progression system (where players progress by having high-scoring rounds), an improved spin system (with fine-tuned shots, massé shots, and jump shots), and new gameplay mechanics (such as ""super balls"" and ""zones"").Along with its eroge spin-offs Pocket Gal and Pocket Gal Deluxe, the game received three sequels in Japan: Side Pocket 2: Densetsu no Hustler (which was released in North America as Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend), Side Pocket 3 (which brought the series into full 3D), and Side Pocket for WonderSwan. The original arcade version was also included in the Wii compilation Data East Arcade Classics. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Side Pocket, players control each shot of the cue ball in a top-down perspective (similar to other pool simulation games of the time). Before each shot, players have three options:They can select which direction to hit the cue ball using the joystick, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory. For precise aiming, the game has players holding down the joystick in a particular direction to begin rotating the cursor towards it.They can use the Spin button and the joystick to change which part of the ball to spin it. Home ports build upon this by allowing multiple levels of each type of spin (including hidden massé shots). Left/Right shots curve the ball in either direction once it hits an object, Draw shots has the cue ball retreat once it hits an object, and Follow shots has the cue ball push forward once it hits an object. Massé shots are unique in that it has the cue ball spin backwards (and optionally left/right) soon after it is shot, and can also be used to launch the ball into the air over other balls.They then perform the shot itself by hitting the Shot button (to start the Power Meter). The Power Meter swings left and right, and players press the Shot button to lock-in the power of the shot and hit it. In some versions, players can cancel the shot using a Cancel button. </div>  <div> Ports : In the standard ""Pocket Game"", players start each set with one of two alternate racks of balls: six balls in a standard pyramid formation (similar to the game of 6-Ball) or nine balls in a thin diamond formation (similar to the game of 9-Ball). Home versions also include a ten-ball pyramid formation (similar to the games of 8-Ball and 10-Ball). Players can pocket each ball in the rack any order, and the set ends when all of these balls are pocketed.Similar to other billiards games at the time, players have a limited amount of shots (or ""balls"") that deplete if the player either pockets the cue ball (for two shots) or fails to pocket any other ball (for one shot). Pocketing the cue ball also causes the other pocketed balls in that shot to return to the table. In addition, the Arcade version of the game has a timer that slowly depletes when the player is figuring out their shot (and can be replenished by pocketing balls). Once the timer or allowed shots depletes, the credit ends and players must add additional credits to continue. In Home versions, there is no timer and players are given more shots to start out with, but players cannot continue.At certain times in the round, one pocket is highlighted and if players pocket a ball in there, they receive bonus points. In the Arcade version, this can be bonus time. In single-player modes, this can be bonus balls. In Home versions of the game, having one racked ball remaining causes one pocket to highlight as the ""Zone"" and players can hit their cue ball in there to enter a special state where if they pocket the final ball in that shot, they earn additional bonus balls. In addition, the Home versions include a ""super shot"" where at certain times, hitting the 9-Ball or 10-Ball causes the table to have less friction (making the shot more hectic).In addition to points earned by pocketing balls and by bonus points, players are scored after each set by each sequence of balls pocketed consecutively and by each sequence of balls pocketed in a numerical sequence, with longer sequences earning more points. In Home versions, high-scoring sets are required to progress through the game. The game also includes a bonus ""trick shot"" between sets, where the table is set-up in a particular way (usually with obstacles) and players must pot balls in specific pockets without hitting obstacles in order to gain additional bonus points.In two-player multiplayer matches, players attempt to end a multi-set match with the highest score (with no ""trick shot"" mini-game). Players do not have a limited amount of balls to work with, instead switching between each player once they either pocket the cue ball or fail to pocket any ball. The Home versions do not include Super Shots or Zones. </div> ",ESRB: E

Space Invaders,Taito Corporation,Nintendo,October 1994,gb,"Space Invaders, released in arcades by Taito in 1978, is one of the most influential and successful video games of all time, laying the foundations for most shooters and action games that followed. It revolutionized the game industry and has become a pop culture icon.",3030-5099,5099,0,1978-06-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/space-invaders/3030-5099/," <div> Overview : One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game’s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) versionGameplay in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player’s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their “invasion.” As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or “bunkers” near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a “mystery ship” will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus. </div>  <div> Development : While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinetDue to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game’s original title, Space Monsters. </div>  <div> Impact and Legacy : Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins—and subsequent production increase—in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 versionThe 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first ""killer app"" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as ""the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time."" Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the ""Top 10 Most Influential Games"" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of ""The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time,"" stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which ""were attempts to simulate already-existing things,"" Space Invaders was ""the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else."" In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a “high score,” and was the first to save the player’s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari’s Asteroids, Williams’ Defender, and Namco’s Galaxian series.It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a ""seminal arcade classic"", IGN listed it as the number eight ""classic shoot 'em up"". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry. </div> ",ESRB: E

Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe,Spidersoft,Mindscape,October 1992,gb,Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is the most realised iteration of the Speedball franchise. Speedball is a brutal sport where armoured teams face-off in a metal-clad arena with the aim of beating down their rivals and scoring goals for fame and fortune.,3030-289,289,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe/3030-289/," <div> Overview : One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp GatesThere are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay. </div> ",ESRB: E

As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of ""spots"" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. ""Spots"" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game. </div> ",

Star Trek: 25th Anniversary was a combination of a point-and-click adventure game and a starship simulator. At release the game proved to be a moderate success both financially and critically. A sequel, Star Trek: Judgment Rites, was released a few years later. The game was developed and published by Interplay. </div>  <div> Plot : Removed from known Star Trek canon, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary used the then new chapter format of game play, deviating from the widely used single story arc.

There are seven missions/stories in the game:Demon World;Hijacked;Love's Labor Jeopardized;Another Fine Mess...;Feathered Serpent;That Old Devil Moon; andVengeance. </div>  <div> CD-ROM Version : As was customary in the early days of the CD-ROM/multimedia craze, Star Trek: 25th Anniversary would later be re-released with a CD-ROM version that included voice acting by the original cast.

Street Racer,Vivid Image,Ubisoft,December 1996,gb,"Up to eight players can race over twenty-seven courses, rumble in a battle arena or play car soccer in this multiplatform cart racer.",3030-22190,22190,0,1994-01-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/street-racer/3030-22190/," <div> Overview : Street Racer is a cart-racing game, developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft and inspired heavily by Super Mario Kart, and the first of its genre to allow 8 players to race simultaneously on split-screen. The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game. </div> ",

A handheld successor to Super Mario Bros., it is one of the launch titles for the Game Boy, developed with no input from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto (instead developed by Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's R&D1 devision).Players control hero plumber Mario as he ventures through the four tropical kingdoms of Sarasaland to rescue Princess Daisy (and the hypnotized inhabitants of the lands) from mysterious space monster Tatanga.The game would receive a direct sequel in 1992, titled Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, which vastly improves upon the platforming aspects of the original while adding a new adversary, Wario (who would play as the protagonist in the series spin-off, Wario Land). Tatanga returns in this sequel (as a boss), while Daisy later becomes a regular in Mario spin-off games (starting with Mario Tennis). Super Mario Land was later released for the Nintendo 3DS (via Virtual Console) on June 6, 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Super Mario Land is a standard sidescrolling platformer (in similar vein to Super Mario Bros.) where players must guide Mario through 12 levels (split into four unique areas, called ""Worlds""), to reach each level's goal (at the rightmost part). Players move Mario using left and right on the d-pad, while holding the ""B"" button to run and hitting the ""A"" button to jump.Like Super Mario Bros., Mario is vulnerable to touching most enemies and their projectiles. If he gets hit once (while not powered-up), falls off the level, or gets trapped in automatic side-scrolling stages, he loses a life and must restart the level. If the player loses all of his lives, then he must either use a continue (and restart the level with three lives and no score) or end the game with a game over. Mario can knock out most enemies by jumping (or falling) on them, gaining points by doing so.Scattered around all levels are coins which can be collected by touching them. Coins can also be found by hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels) from below. For every 100 coins collected, the player earns an extra life. For every 100,000 points earned, the player earns an extra continue.The end of most levels contain two exits, one of which is located at the top of the screen and is more difficult to access. If Mario reaches the higher exit, then the player is rewarded with a mini-game in which players can earn a Fire Flower power-up or up to three extra lives. </div>  <div> Stages : By hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels), players can find special power-ups which grant Mario special abilities.Super Mushroom - Transforms Mario into Super Mario, giving him a taller stature while allowing Mario to get hit once without losing a life.Fire Flower - Only appears if Mario is Super Mario. If Mario is no longer Super Mario before touching one, it automatically applies the Super Mushroom power-up. Mario also has the ability to throw ""superballs"" (by tapping the B button), which bounce off surfaces and knock out most enemies.Starman - Grants Mario temporary invincibility (as indicated by a change in background music and Mario's clothes flickering). Mario can still lose a life by falling off the level or getting trapped in automatic side-scrolling levels. </div> ",ESRB: E
Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins,Nintendo,Nintendo,"November 2, 1992",gb,"Mario's second platforming adventure on Game Boy introduces the evil Wario, who has taken over Mario's castle in his absence.

After rescuing Princess Daisy from the alien Tatanga in Sarasaland, Mario returns to his castle in Mario Land only to discover that it has been taken over by Wario, his jealous longtime rival, and that the residents of Mario Land have been placed under Wario's evil spell. Mario must gather the six golden coins that collectively serve as the keys to his castle in order to confront Wario and liberate Mario Land.The game is notable for featuring Wario's first appearance as a new character. Although he merely functions as the final boss in 6 Golden Coins, Wario would later go on to star in his several of his own games, including the Wario Land series of platformers and the WarioWare franchise.Super Mario Land 2 was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as a Virtual Console title in late 2011. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game's first stageSuper Mario Land 2 follows the basic template of several prior Mario platforming titles, particularly Super Mario World which had been released only two years prior. Mario makes use of his impressive jumping abilities to traverse several separate stages while collecting power-ups, which can help him to avoid or defeat his enemies. The Spin Jump from Super Mario World also makes its return in this game, allowing Super Mario or Fire Mario to break certain blocks underneath his feet.Mario typically proceeds from left-to-right in order to reach the Goal at the end of the stage. Every stage contains a small bell somewhere near the middle that serves as a checkpoint, allowing Mario to resume from that point in the stage after losing a life. Players can optionally try to reach a larger bell hanging above the stage Goal; if Mario manages to ring the large bell, he will be taken to a bonus stage in which the player can attempt to earn power-ups or extra lives by playing one of two mini-games.A bonus stageWhile Super Mario Land 2 features Coins, a staple of the Mario series, these collectibles are handled in a different manner than in previous games. Instead of granting players a 1-Up after collecting one hundred Coins, the game continues to increase the tally at the bottom of the screen up to a maximum of 999 Coins. Coins can be spent at the Casino hidden in a cave near Mario's castle for more chances to earn power-ups and extra lives. If Mario completely exhausts his stock of extra lives, the player will receive a game over screen; additionally, any of the six golden coins collected up to that point will be returned to their respective Zone's bosses, requiring Mario to defeat these bosses a second time.A second counter at the bottom of the screen reflects the number of enemies defeated by Mario. Defeating one hundred enemies causes a Starman to appear nearby, which Mario can collect to gain temporary invincibility. Defeating five enemies while invincible grants Mario an extra life, and the player will continue to gain 1-Ups for every enemy defeated afterward until the effect expires. </div>  <div> Zones : Super Mushroom: Small Mario transforms into Super Mario after picking up this item, allowing players to break certain blocks by jumping up from below, as well as by spin-jumping from above.Fire Flower: Fire Mario can toss fireballs at enemies from a distance, but certain foes are immune to his projectiles. Fireballs can also break certain special blocks.Carrot: This power-up is unique to Super Mario Land 2. It transforms players into Bunny Mario, who can glide through the air by flapping his long ears. Unlike other flight-based power-ups from previous Mario titles, such as the Super Leaf or Feather Cape, Bunny Mario cannot actually fly in the proper sense; he can only slow his descent by gliding while airborne.Starman: Grants temporary invincibility for fifteen seconds.Soap Bubble: Only available in the Hippo stage, Mario can find large bubbles near two hippo-shaped statues that allow him to fly when he touches them. However, soap bubbles are easily popped by enemies.Space Mario: Mario dons a space suit during his visit to the Space Zone. While on the moon, Mario can jump much higher than normal. In outer space, holding the A button causes Mario to ascend at a constant rate. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Every character can equip a weapon, armor, and accessory item.Theo is the previous protagonist of The Sword of Hope, as well as the protagonist of The Sword of Hope II. He has strong offense and defense skills, a good selection of weapons and armor to equip, and is able to learn magic spells like Melt, Motion, and Dark.Mute is his name, not an adjectiveMute comes from a clan of mages. He is a magical powerhouse, learning most of the spells. This boy wizard joins Theo's company after the prince investigates the ancient temple to find everyone but Mute massacred. At first, Mute suspects Theo is the one who murdered his entire family. However, the quick appearance of Mute's father in ghostly forms convinces him otherwise, and the two join forces to find the demon responsible.Nina, missing her fatherNina joins Theo's company after being rescued from a sandworm attack. She is searching for her father and believes that by using an item called the Sand Drop, it will reveal the underground template where he disappeared to. So far, she has not had any luck finding him.Bogi the Forthcoming Fire DragonslayerBogi saves Theo's company from a one-sided fight with a creeper monster, dealing massive damage to it in one fell swoop. He's a fighter who calls himself an expert monster hunter, with the main goal in life to kill a Fire Dragon...just for the fun of it. Seeing that Theo is traveling the lands, he joins up with the company in hope of finding a dragon along the way.Layl, probably short for LaylaLayl is a young woman with strong healing powers. Before joining Theo's company, she saves the prince and his companions from a deadly whirlpool with the help of her submarine. She and the monster hunter Bogi are somewhat connected to each other, which leads some to awkward adventuring.Prince Theo will also come across a great number of NPCs, from innkeepers to shopkeepers to fortune tellers. Some of the more colorful characters include the demon Jaghi, King Winder, and old man Yota, a hermit living in a sea-side cave. </div>  <div> Magic : As Theo and his company levels up, they will learn new spells.

Tetris Attack,Intelligent Systems,Nintendo,August 1996,gb,"One of the progenitors of the ""swap and match"" tile-based action-puzzle games, featuring either a Yoshi theme (for its international ""Tetris Attack"" release) or a cutesy fairy theme (for its Japanese ""Panel de Pon"" release).",3030-13130,13130,0,1995-10-27,https://www.giantbomb.com/tetris-attack/3030-13130/," <div> Overview : The original Japanese version of the game, known as ""Panel de Pon"", features an original cutesy world inhabited by fairies.Tetris Attack (known in Japan as Panel de Pon) is a 2D tile-matching puzzle game developed by Intelligent Systems (in conjunction with Nintendo's R&D1 team) and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan (on October 27, 1995), North America (on August 1996) and Europe (on November 28, 1996).Although its international name shares the same name as the Tetris series, this game bares no resemblance to other Tetris games and instead uses a new original gameplay style of manipulating an evolving playfield using a horizontal two-tile cursor.Unlike most tile-matching games of the era (where players must manipulate the placement of new groups of tiles), Tetris Attack has players swapping tiles already on the playfield (allowing them to form their own chains of tile matches, similar to the Columns and Puyo Puyo series).Both Japanese and international versions of the game differ in theme, with the international version using characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island (in similar fashion to Kirby's Avalanche) and a new original soundtrack. The Japanese version takes place in the fantasy world of Popples, where the fairy protagonist Lip must defeat her fairy friends to stop them from fighting (due to a spell by the devil king Sanatos).The game received a handheld port for the Game Boy, with all versions using the Yoshi theme. While it was released at the same time as the console version in North America and Europe, it was released on October 26, 1996 in Japan (as Yoshi no Panepon). The original game also received two limited releases on the Japan-exclusive Satellaview service: BS Yoshi no Panepon (which was released in November 1996 and uses the Yoshi theme) and Panel de Pon Event '98 (which was released in December 1997 and uses the original theme).The game later received multiple sequels under the ""Puzzle League"" name, none of which use the Yoshi theme. A sequel to the original Super Famicom release, Panel de Pon 64, was nearly finished before being cancelled and reworked into Pokémon Puzzle League; this canceled version was ultimately finished and released as part of the Japan-exclusive GameCube compilation Nintendo Puzzle Collection.The Panel de Pon version of the game was later digitally re-released in Japan as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (on November 27, 2007), Wii U (on May 25, 2013), and Nintendo 3DS (on August 9, 2016). It was later included in the Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online collection worldwide for the Nintendo Switch on May 20, 2020, making this version's first debut outside of Japan. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay consists of a well partially filled with either 5 or 6 distinct types of tiles, depending on the difficulty level. Adjacent tiles may be swapped horizontally with the cursor, and matching three or more tiles vertically or horizontally will result in the tiles clearing after a short delay animation, during which they become immovable. Additional points may be earned with either ""combos,"" which involve clearing more than 3 tiles simultaneously, or ""chains,"" which require that the tiles above a clearing set fall into another clear. During play, the stack of tiles will slowly rise to the top of the screen, though clearing tiles will pause this advance. After a grace period after the stack reaches the top of the well, the game will end. </div>  <div> Game Modes : There are 5 major game modes in Tetris Attack. In most modes, a difficulty level may be selected, and in some modes an initial speed may be selected; this may be confusing to new players, but while the difficulty level affects the rate at which death occurs, the number of tile types in play, and the rate at which tiles fall upon finding themselves in mid-air, the initial speed merely controls the speed at which the stack rises. </div>  <div> Characters & Stages : This mode allows the player to select a difficulty level and speed, and allows nearly limitless play. The name of the mode is misleading, however, as gameplay will necessarily end: either the player will die, or reach 99,999 points, upon which the game will end. Should the player reach this maximum point score, credits will be rolled. </div>  <div> Scoring : This mode provides a 2 minute length of time in which to earn as many points as possible. The difficulty and speed may be set prior to the game. This mode may be played with either 1 or 2 players. </div>  <div> Advanced Gameplay Mechanics : The Stage Clear mode requires that players clear the stack down to a particular ""clear line"" to pass each stage, of which there are several per character in the game. In addition, there are certain ""boss battles,"" in which the player must earn points as quickly as possible to reduce the boss's HP level to zero. </div>  <div> Story and Multiple Endings : This mode involves a collection of designed puzzles, of which there are ten per character in the game, as well as many ""special"" levels, totaling 120 levels. Each involves a set of tiles that must be cleared completely within the predetermined number of tile swaps. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

Contest is simply the equivalent of Tetris Type A, while Puzzle creates specific scenarios in which the player has to remove all the lines with a certain number of specific pieces, similar to the Puzzle mode of Tetris 2.The original Super Tetris 2: Bombliss was released around the end of 1992.

Using one of three available characters, the player must traverse through four stages, culminating in a fight against Montana Max. Along the way, players can collect gems that can be used to play one of two mini-games, Montana Mash and Race, which can earn you extra lives. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay in Babs' Big Break is very similar the Mario titles: items fall from boxes when they are hit by players, enemies die when jumped on, hollow tree stumps send the character to the underground, and endless pits cause the player to die. Babs' Big Break slightly expands on this formula, however, including dynamic environments, such as traveling train cars that lose ambient light when passing under a bridge. Switches and buttons are also used to open doors and gates, specifically in the haunted woods level. The haunted woods level also features the classical piece of music In the Hall of the Mountain King. </div>  <div> Characters : Despite the title of the game, Babs is not a playable character in Babs' Big Break. Instead, the player can chose to control either Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, or Hamton Pig at will. Each of the characters has their own unique projectile weapon that they can use to knock over enemies:Buster - A carrot. It flies like an underhand softball toss, and can reach high places.Plucky - A pineapple. It bounces off the floor, walls, and ceiling.Hamton - A watermelon. It's tossed like a bowling ball, and rolls along the ground.Occasionally, obstacles will call for the aide of additional characters. Dizzy Devil is able to burrow under a mountain to progress to the next stage, while Furrball can sneak under city pipes to progress the player. Dizzy is also called upon during a cafeteria boss level, where the player needs to make Dizzy eat all of the chicken and goodies while avoiding spikes and other traps. Shirley the Loon also provides way to traverse a large pitfall. Her psychic abilities allow the player to cross on a floating carpet.Montana Max is naturally the game's enemy, using his disposable wealth to threaten the player in the final levels. Once in his mansion, Montana drives a large steamroller from side to side of the screen, while the player is forced to keep up with the auto scrolling level. </div> ",

An enhanced Game Boy Color version was released the following year. </div>  <div> Plot : Title screen for Wario Land II on the GBC.One morning while Wario is sleeping in his castle, Captain Syrup and her Black Sugar Gang sneak into his home. The invaders manage to steal all of Wario's treasure he had collected in the first Wario Land game and flood his home by leaving a large water faucet in his basement running. During the raid, the Pirate Gooms accidentally set off Wario's giant alarm clock, but make their escape before he begins stirring. Eventually Wario wakes up and figures out what Syrup and her Gooms have done, setting out to find them. He pursues the Black Sugar Gang across the varied areas outside of his castle in the hopes of having his treasure returned and gaining his revenge against the intruders. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Dungeons! Giant snakes! Giant snakes in dungeons!Wario Land II is noticeably different from the first Wario Land game. Wario is now invulnerable, and is instead susceptible to different transformations from enemy attacks. For instance, if an enemy stomps on Wario's head, he might be flattened, enabling him to cross gaps he might otherwise have fallen through. Of course some enemies are just nuisances and won't help Wario in any way, but regardless an enemy will never cause Wario to die. This change emphasizes puzzle solving and platforming rather than traditional survival.The game has several branching level paths that change how the game's storyline plays out, many of which have their own variation of the game's ending. Once the player has completed one of the endings, they can select any stage they have completed and see which treasures they have and have not collected.

Wario's gameplay style is brute force mixed with elements of timing (namely jumps) and deductive reasoning. The Wario scheme of dealing with a problem is typically to barge it out of the picture in exchange for a few coins, in addition enemies can be picked up and thrown to take out other enemies or for accumulation of yet more coins.The game's levels are spread throughout a large island which is divided into a number of smaller areas in a similar way to Mario Land 2 and within these areas the individual levels are arranged in a linear path with a boss fight lying at the end. While Mario Land allowed players to tackle its areas in any order Wario Land features a linear progression throughout, which, while being more constrictive than its predecessor means the game has a much more refined difficulty arc which spans its entirety as opposed to only each individual area.Graphically, Wario Land is a drastic departure from the Mario titles available for the Game Boy and replaces the shiny and clean-looking sprites which are reminiscent of cartoon strips with grittier and darker ones in line with Wario’s character. The detail is also increased over previous games, with many more pixels dedicated to character models and locations giving the game increased clarity and overall graphical quality. </div>  <div> Power-up Hats : Wario - Standard Wario, will shrink if hit by an enemy.Bull Wario - Upgraded Wario can cling to ceilings, perform floor stomps and destroy destructible blocks in one hit.Dragon Wario - A dragon hat enables Wario to shoot flames on dry land and a jet of gas underwater which damages enemies, and destroys blocks from a distance.Jet - Jet propelled hat lets Wario run faster and fly for short distances - even under water. </div>  <div> Game Areas : Rice Beach - Consists of relatively simple platforming levels which feature water and quicksand as environmental hazards. The boss is named Toge Bro. who looks like a standard Koopa with spikes that stands upright.Mt. Teapot - Mountain and cave based levels. The boss is named Beefine who is a bi-pedal bull.Sherbet Land - A secret world with ice themed levels where slippery surfaces offer added challenges. The boss is Hinyari, a penguin with spiked boxing gloves.Stove Canyon - Levels are themed around lava with collapsing bridges and many flying enemies. The boss is Funfun, a giant head with a skull on its forehead.SS Teacup - A Pirate themed level. The boss is  Bobo, a giant bird.Parsley Woods - Levels are split between trees and railroad tracks with the former consisting of standard platforming fare and the latter introducing moving train cars which add the difficulty of fighting enemies while avoiding obstacles and staying on the cars. The boss is Zenisukii, a ghost.Syrup Castle - The final area holds fiendish platforming levels where timing and pixel-perfect jumps are a necessity. Spring blocks add an extra level of challenge by vastly increasing jumping distance. The final boss is Captain Syrup and her Genie Denpu. </div>  <div> Treasures : Once players defeat the boss of the each main area, some previous levels in that area will be slightly different. There will be new doors that require a key in the level that let players collect one of 15 Treasures. These treasures help determine the ending. When players finish the game, it counts up the money and treasures collected; this total determines what reward Wario is given at the end of the game.

This is actually one of the only indications that the game has anything to do with the movie: The Sun, for millions of years the source of life, but for one planet the source of it's demise. The temperatures climbed, the vast fields of ice at its poles melted and the oceans rose. Centuries later, few people remained on this planet once called earth. The only remaining pockets of civilisation are floating islands of debris called Atolls.The player assumes the role of the Mariner, the drifter played by Kevin Costner in the movie, and fends off Smokers but that's about all the game has in common with the movie. Note: ""it's"" in the first line is a spelling mistake that the developers made.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game alternates between 3 different gameplay phases: some levels have the player piloting a boat, others have them doing some platforming and then there are the bonus stages: Boat levels: The player controls a sail boat and must fend off Smokers who are riding jet skis, planes and motor boats. They're attacking the Atolls and the player must destroy them with their missiles. They must also save drowning civilians. Platforming levels: Here the player takes control of the Mariner and must kill all the Smokers to move on to the next level. He starts off with a machete but can get other weapons, such as a gun, from the enemies he kills. The player always plays on the exact same level as they're always defending the same Atoll. Bonus levels: The player unlocks these after completing a boat level. It consists of the Mariner swimming underwater, trying to get bonus items before they run out of breath. If he runs out of breath while underwater, the player automatically loses all the items they had collected. These items earn points that can then be spent in the in-game shop to upgrade the ship. </div> ",ESRB: K-A

The game includes 16 courses, split into two separate game modes (traditional racing and free-form checkpoint racing), and supports linked multiplayer via the Game Link Cable (with further support for four-player multiplayer using the Four Player Adapter).The game later received two sequels, one for the Nintendo 64 (Wave Race 64) and one for the GameCube (Wave Race: Blue Storm).

Faster Divisions require more laps to complete. Players earn points based on their final placement in the course (5 for first place, 3 for second, 2 for third, and 1 for last), but can fail to score points if the timer expires (which refresh between laps).Slalom Mode is a unique checkpoint-based racing mode, where players race to claim checkpoints scattered throughout the water. Once a checkpoint is claimed by a player, it cannot be claimed by another. After all checkpoints are claimed, the race ends and players earn points based on how many checkpoints they claimed.In 1-P Mode, players start with only one Division for each game mode: National Series 550cc. In order to participate in faster Divisions (650cc and 800cc), as well as the harder World Series, players must complete each unlocked Division with a certain point requirement. In Multiplayer Mode, all Divisions are unlocked from the start.Additionally, players can practice each Circuit and Slalom course with no opponents at any Division (regardless of how much of the game is unlocked). </div>  <div> Courses : Both Circuit and Slalom modes have eight courses each, for a total of 16 courses.

THQ released a title with phenomenal visuals and an impressive amount of customization for your entrance. They even attempt to mimic the camera angles popularized on the RAW broadcast, so you'll see the action from a long list of unusual perspectives.It also had a fairly unique game mechanic in that a health meter is replaced with a popularity meter. If the crowd is really behind somebody, you won't be able to pin them, which makes it vital that one really beats down on their opponent to win. You have to work an offense based on this, so spamming a certain move actually backfires as if you do a certain move repeatedly, the audience will cease responding to it and it will end up not doing much to actually defeat the opponent. If the man is pinnable and you do not pin them, the crowd will turn on you as well. Obviously, the more popular the wrestler (such as Rock), the more difficult it is to defeat them. It is possible, but it is quite difficult. The reversal engine is based primarily on timing button presses.The grappling engine seems to borrow, somewhat, from THQ's UFC titles of that era. The grappling engine hit a medium between the No Mercy and Smackdown series.There is no appreciable storyline in the game, something that had started appearing in wrestling games at about that point. The matches also tended to run fairly long. 15 minute or more matches are not all that unusual in WWF RAW, making quick pick-up-and-play sessions a bit of a challenge to pull off. And while the customization in your entrance is very in-depth, the customization of your characters appearance and moveset is far less in-depth. There is also no real weight classification. Anybody can do all of their moves to anybody else, no matter the size difference. Women wrestlers can bodyslam The Undertaker without a problem, for example. </div>  <div> Roster : Al SnowAlbertThe Big ShowBilly GunBradshawBubba Ray DudleyChris BenoitChris JerichoChristianCrash HollyD-Von DudleyEddie GuerreroEdgeFaarooqFunakiHakuHardcore HollyIvoryJeff HardyJustin CredibleK-KwikKaneKurt AngleLitaMatt HardyMolly HollyPerry SaturnRavenRhinoRikishiThe RockSpike DudleySteve AustinSteve BlackmanTajiriTAKA MichinokuTazzTestTriple HThe Blue MeanieTrish StratusThe UndertakerVince McMahonWilliam RegalX-PacShane McMahonStephanie McMahon-HelmsleyFred Durst </div> ",ESRB: T

As one of the Mario Brothers, swap trays of monster blocks to catch falling ones, and clear large stacks with Yoshi Eggs for bonus points!",3030-19197,19197,0,1991-12-14,https://www.giantbomb.com/yoshi/3030-19197/," <div> Overview : Yoshi (known in Japan as Yoshi no Tamago, or ""Yoshi's Egg"", and in Europe as Mario & Yoshi) is a falling-block tile-matching puzzle game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy on December 14, 1991 in Japan, on June and July 1992 in North America, and on December 1992 in Europe.Similar like Nintendo's earlier puzzle game Dr. Mario, Yoshi has players attempting to clear the playfield by matching falling blocks together. However, instead of controlling the falling blocks themselves, players now swap adjacent columns that are stacked on top of trays (held by either Mario or Luigi, depending on the player). The game's namesake comes from special tiles resembling Yoshi Eggs, which can be used to sandwich tiles together to form a Yoshi that grants bonus points.The NES version was later digitally released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii (in 2007), Nintendo 3DS (first as part of the 3DS Ambassador Program on September 1, 2011, then worldwide on 2012-2013), and Wii U (on June 12, 2013). The NES version was also included in the Nintendo Switch Online - Nintendo Entertainment System service for the Nintendo Switch on September 19, 2018.It is notable for being Nintendo's first collaboration with Game Freak, who later developed the mainline Pokémon series of role-playing games for Nintendo. They would also collaborate on Mario & Wario, Game Boy Camera, Drill Dozer, HarmoKnight, and Pocket Card Jockey. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Game Boy version of the game. While it seems like it's only 4x7, the topmost row is actually on the black line above.In Yoshi, players are given a 4x8 playfield, with each of the four columns held up on a tray. Goombas, Piranha Plants, Boo Buddies, and Bloopers all fall from the sky, each of which can be removed (giving 5 points) by lining two of them up vertically. The game ends once a monster cannot enter the playfield on a full column.Rather than controlling the falling monsters themselves, players instead guide Mario (or Luigi as the second player in a two-player game) between each tray (using the d-pad) and can press either A or B button to swap the two trays their holding (and the stacks they hold). They can also quicken the fall speed of the falling monsters by holding down on the d-pad. While players cannot normally change the column of falling monsters, they can ""push"" them to adjacent columns by swapping a column taller than its current position onto it. </div> ",ESRB: E
Yoshi's Cookie,TOSE,Nintendo,April 1993,gb,A tile-matching puzzle game with characters from the Mario series. Shift around a group of delicious cookies in order to make matches and clear them out.,3030-16966,16966,0,1992-11-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/yoshis-cookie/3030-16966/," <div> Overview : Yoshi's Cookie (known in Japan as Yoshi no Cookie) is a tile-matching puzzle game developed by Tose and published by Nintendo (under license from Bullet-Proof Software) for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy on November 21, 1992 in Japan, on April 10, 1993 in North America, and on April 28, 1994 in Europe.In Yoshi's Cookie, players are given a rectangular group of cookie tiles and must arrange them so that an entire row or column has the same cookie type (which removes them from the playfield). Players can only arrange the group of cookies by shifting entire rows or columns (which wrap around eachother) and the game uses a corner-based ""gravity"" (with tiles ""falling"" both top-to-bottom and right-to-left).Similar to Dr. Mario and Yoshi, the game features characters and settings from Nintendo's Mario series, including mascots Mario and Yoshi (with later versions also including Princess Toadstool and Bowser). Along with a round-based single-player mode, the game includes a unique VS Mode with a special 5x5 playfield and power-ups. The GB version features support for the Four Player Adapter, allowing for four-player multiplayer.It later received a port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. Developed and published by Bullet-Proof Software, the SNES version features two additional modes: a single-player VS Mode (where players play against a CPU opponent) and a Puzzle Mode (where players have a limited amount of moves to clear a static playfield). Its Puzzle Mode is notable for its puzzles designed by Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov.The game was originally developed without Nintendo licensing as an arcade game by Home Data titled Hermetica. Due to poor testing, the game was unreleased and its rights were sold to Bullet-Proof Software, who began producing the SNES version (licensing it to Nintendo for the NES/GB versions, with Nintendo licensing its characters and setting for the SNES version).The SNES version of the game received both a rare tie-in re-release (Yoshi no Cookie: Kuruppon Oven de Cookie) and an enhanced port for the GameCube (as part of the Japanese-exclusive Nintendo Puzzle Collection). The NES version was later digitally re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2008 (April in North America and Europe, June in Japan). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is made up of a square grid, broken up into 25 to 49 sections (5 x 5 or 7 x 7) depending on the version. Cookies of various decorations fill in the entire grid. The player manipulates entire rows either horizontally or vertically to try to match cookies that are alike. Once a row is filled with cookies of the same design, their point count increases by one and the row is wiped off of the screen. </div>  <div> Yoshi's Cookie: Kuruppon Oven de Cookie : In VS Mode, both players are given a 5x5 board that automatically re-fills after a combo ends and cannot ""over-fill"". The objective is to win rounds by either accumulating 25 points (with each row/column clear worth a point) or having their opponent failing to make a match on a time limit.The game's power-up system is unique in that both its effects and the player receiving these effects change over time, with the possibility that players can penalize themselves if not careful. The player's current power-up is activated once they make a match of Yoshi cookies.Blind - The chosen player cannot see the center 3x3 tiles of their board for a short time.Panic - The chosen player's board is shuffled for a short time.Slave - The chosen player's cursor is now controlled by the other player for a short time.-3, +3, -7, +7 - Removes from, or adds to, the chosen player's Point Meter.In the SNES version, players choose between four characters, each with their own unique stats (mostly affecting how long each power-up effect against them lasts):Mario - Average effect duration and power-up cycling.Yoshi - Shortened effect duration, at the cost of slower power-up cycling.Princess Toadstool - Faster power-up cycling, at the cost of lengthened effect duration.Bowser - Similar to Mario. However, effects he generates have a much longer duration, at the cost of a halved turn timer. </div> ",ESRB: E
