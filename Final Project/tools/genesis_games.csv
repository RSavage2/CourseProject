The player assumes the role of Ripley as she explores the prison planet of Fury 161.,3030-14356,14356,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/alien3/3030-14356/,," <div> Overview : With the release of the Alien 3 film several games were released to tie into the film. With the Super Nintendo and Genesis as the leading platforms the game was built and ported to other systems, including the Commodore 64 and Game Gear. The games are set on the world of the film, Fury 161, but the gameplay actually has more in common with the film Aliens, throwing wave after wave of enemies at the player. Whereas in Alien 3 there was only one xenomorph.The video game versions (except the Nintendo Entertainment System) were praised at the time of its release for not sticking with the lack of guns and multiple aliens in the film, which was the film's most criticized aspects. </div>  <div> SNES Version : The SNES version had varied missions to complete.In the SNES version, Ripley begins the game in a corridor where she can operate a computer terminal which gives her access to various missions. Missions have Ripley completing objectives such as destroying groups of eggs, fixing pipes or junction boxes, isolating rooms, killing Alien Queens or rescuing trapped inmates. Completing these missions leads to the game's ending, which is closer to the movie than the other versions. Like most versions of the game, the SNES version was liberal with the material, generating waves of enemies to combat.Unlike the other versions of the game, health, ammo and enemies respawn during the levels.There are 6 levels in total, each having a range of missions in them. Since completing a level takes around half an hour to an hour, the levels can be accessed via a password system.The soundtrack is inspired on that of the film's, unlike the Genesis's more action game music. Complex orchestrations delivered by the SNES's sound chip accompany the game to give it a movie-like feeling.The graphics are also superior, having rich detail in the backgrounds and effects like smoke and rain occurring in parts of Fury 161. Ripley and her enemies have smooth animations and there are lighting effects on the scenery and/or the objects when using a flame thrower in egg rooms or closing a door.The SNES version was released after the movie, therefore it doesn't contain any deleted scenes or scenery present at the time of the other versions' developments. </div>  <div> Genesis Version : The Genesis version was a slightly different case. Instead of missions in a large, persistent area, the game uses stages (or levels) like many other platformers of the time. The majority of these see the player fighting their way through hordes of Aliens in order to rescue prisoners before the timer runs out. When the timer does run out, the player is show a scene of each of the remaining prisoners giving birth to a chestburster Alien. In addition to these rescue missions, there are other mission instances. Every few missions the player must fight a boss alien (and in the games finale, two at once) and occasionally, the player will have to rescue lots of prisoners, without interference from Aliens. As well as the opposite, having to shoot lots of Aliens and reach the exit without needing to rescue prisoners.Rescue the prisoners as fast as possible, before this happens.The game consists of roughly 20 missions, each increasing in difficulty and features several different locations from the movie (such as the prison grounds, the lead works, the slaughter house, the Alien nest, etc) and features a number of weapons commonly seen in the franchise (but ironically, none of which were seen in the actual film) the pulse rifle, flamethrower, grenade launcher and hand grenades.In addition to this, the player is given health and battery pickups. The battery pickups allow the motion tracker in the top right hand corner of the screen to work for a short time, but once the battery has run out it reverts to being blank again until the player picks up another battery. Enemies include the ubiquitous Alien, as well as much later in the game Eggs and Facehuggers, in addition to the larger boss Aliens.Since the movie was subject to various creative inputs due to a lack of consent over the final script, many things were scrapped but some remained in the video game, such as the abattoir level (which is present in the recent Alien 3 Assembly Cut) and the fact that Ripley survives in the end. </div>  <div> Master System, Game Gear, Amiga and Commodore 64 Versions : The Master System and Game Gear versions are very similar to the Genesis version, the first few levels are exactly the same but with a major graphical downgrade. The player has access to largely the same arsenal of movements and weapons, as well as having a countdown clock and prisoners to rescue. Beyond the first few levels, they begin to differ slightly, but not much from the Genesis version of the game.The Commodore 64 version follows the same principle and scenery of the Genesis game, but with altered level design.The Amiga version looked and played similar to the Genesis version in terms of graphics but the player had to choose either to play the music or sound effects but not both. </div>  <div> NES Version : The NES version was developed by LJN LTD, and featured a drastically different visual style as well as gameplay mechanics. The graphics are indistinct, the Alien creatures appear to be vague shapes of solid color and the game world itself features a lot less detail than that of the Master System, or other versions. The game features a large HUD which occupies the bottom portion of the screen and displays information such as remaining ammunition. The game's sound effects were also a much lower quality than that of other versions. The game featured a variety of different mission locations taken from the film, and like the other versions the main objective throughout the game is to rescue prisoners on each level before proceeding to the exit.Though seen as a mediocre game at the time of its release, the game has been heavily criticized as time went by. </div> "

This tennis game does not have any other notable tennis stars to note but features many game play options like practice, tournament and skins tournament that makes this game unique from other tennis games before it. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game uses the same rules of tennis that is played today. A player must get over 40 points to win a game, 6 games to win a set and win 2 sets out of the 3 to finish the full match. The game allows the player to play either singles or doubles in either tournament or skins tournament. They can even select what court surface to play on like grass, clay, hard or indoor. After the player selects a type of game, they will have a choice of any of these players: Andre AgassiTiger BallRon PepperDon MattBob ""Bit"" ChinGeorge KingCarol ArkCassie NovaEach athlete has attributes for them like speed, strength (backhand, forehand and server) and accuracy (backhand, forehand and server) which makes the choice of athlete an interesting one. Once an athlete has been selected, two main buttons will be used during the match. The (A) button will help the player lob the ball in the air while the (B) button will help them hit the ball normally (this is for the Genesis version). When the ball is served or hit on the player's side of the court, they must get as close as possible to the ball and hit it back. The player can use either a backhand or forehand depending on their position before hitting the ball. They can move around the court and position themselves using the D-pad. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Practice Mode - This mode allows the player to select an athlete and have a ball machine feed them balls so the player can practice their game.

Although they share some similarities, the two games are quite different. The SNES version of the game allows for the player to switch between the three characters, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, at will. There are no actual ""lives"" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to ""try and take over the world"". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm (""air kiss"") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and ""welcoming"" the player to the game). </div> "

One of the major selling points of the game is the ability to punch opponents as a means of stealing the ball from them (with the taglines ""It's a BasketBRAWL!"" and ""No harm, no foul!""). Its game style was later improved upon with the 1993 spiritual successor, NBA Jam.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1990, and to both the Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear in 1992. The NES version was ported by Rare and published by Acclaim, while the other two versions were ported by Arc Developments and published by Acclaim's Flying Edge brand.Similar to other Midway arcade games at the time, Arch Rivals was included in numerous compilations throughout the 2000's, including Midway Arcade Treasures 2 (for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube), Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play (for PlayStation Portable), Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition (for PC), Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures (for PlayStation 2), Midway Arcade (for iOS devices), and Midway Arcade Origins (for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Along with moving around the screen with the joystick, players have access to two buttons: Pass (White) and Shoot (Red). These buttons perform different actions depending on ball possession:If the player has the ball, pressing the Pass button causes them to pass the ball to their teammate, while pressing the Shoot button causes them to attempt a jump shot (or a dunk if close to the basket). The Pass button can be held down, leaving them unable to move (due to the ""double dribble"" rule), and pressing Shoot while in this state instead performs a ""Fake-Out"" jump shot.If the player's teammate has the ball, pressing either button causes them to call out plays (""Pass It!"", ""Over Here"", and ""I'm Open"" for passing and ""Shoot It!"" ""Put It Up!"", and ""Let's Go!"" for shooting), forcing their teammate to either pass or shoot.Otherwise, pressing the Pass button causes the player to throw a punch in an attempt to knockdown their opponents (causing them to drop the ball if they possess it), while pressing the Shoot button causes them to perform a jumping block (both for attempting to block an opponent's shot and for getting a rebound from a jump shot). The Pass button can be held down, and pressing Shoot while in this state causes the player to perform a leaping lunge (which steals the ball from the opponent if done right, but causes them to tumble to the floor otherwise). </div>  <div> Teams & Players : The game includes four fictional teams by default: Chicago (red/white), Los Angeles (blue/gold), Natural High (green/white), and Brawl State (purple/gold). Each match starts with a random combination of teams, and can re-shuffle the teams as long as they'd like.In the Arcade version, arcade operators can use the ""Hometown Heroes"" feature to change both the names and colors of each team. Other color combinations include blue/red, black/red, black/orange, black/gold, black/gray, black/white, purple/white, green/gold, purple/gold, and red/gold.In the NES version, the Away jerseys for all teams is white. In the Genesis and Game Gear versions, the colors of all teams are randomized (red/white, blue/white, green/white, gold/white, and purple/white), with no separate Home jersey.In all versions but the GG port, each player chooses one of eight fictional basketball players to represent them:Blade - A Crowd PleaserHammer - Rebound KingLewis - Top ShooterMohawk - Tough & MeanMoose - Real ChampReggie - All-AmericanTyrone - Defensive GiantVinnie - A Great PlayerWhile each player has their own description, it is unknown whether it affects their actual stats.

The player may select from three courses/locations: United States, Great Britain, and Japan. By progressing through Tournament mode, the player will develop better skills, allowing him or her to hit the ball harder and with greater precision, and also provides the player the use of new, better golf clubs. While the game possesses no save option, it does provide a code that can be used in order to start over at a particular round.Practice mode gives players a chance to hone their golf skills and allows them access to all skill levels and golf clubs.In play, the golfer's caddy provides useful information based on the player's skill level. At the lowest levels, the caddy will only be able to show the distance from the ball to the tee. However, as the player progresses through the rounds, the caddy can give more situational advice.The game utilizes a traditional control scheme, requiring the player to stop a moving meter at given points in order to determine height and strength of a shot. Upon reaching the green, the view switches to a closeup of the ball's position, and provides the player with a simple map of the green for easier shot making. </div> "

The game is set decades before the events of SNK's other fighting game at the time,  Fatal Fury.

The fourth button is a taunting button. Not every character can perform throws and walljumps. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireballs can be canceled out using punches or kicks.The game also features a ""spirit gauge"", which controls when the player can perform special and super moves. The gauge lowers after the player performs a special/super move. The more powerful the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when the opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually by holding down either the punch or kick button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left.Only Ryo and Robert have super (the Haou Shou Ken) and ""desperation"" (Ryuko Ranbou) moves that can only be learned through a special bonus stage. Both moves take up much of the spirit gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar).In single-player Story mode, the player is usually at a disadvantage with shorter life and spirit gauges. These can be increased in special bonus stages, where the player must perform a certain task (careful button pressing or button mashing). </div>  <div> Characters : The game features 10 playable characters, the two protagonists being the only ones playable in single-player Story Mode: Ryo Sakazaki Robert GarciaIn Story Mode, the game progresses as follows against each opponent consecutively: Ryuhaku Todoh Jack Turner Lee Pai Long King Mickey Rogers John Crawley Mr. Big (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)???

The game includes fifteen main levels (called ""chapters"") split up into six main areas (ranging from forests to the Wild West) and one final level (set in space).Bubsy has two abilities at his disposal: jumping (by pressing the Jump button) and gliding (by pressing the Glide button). Gliding reduces his downward falling speed, and activating it at the right time before bouncing up allows Bubsy to be propelled much higher than usual.Running into enemies, touching deadly obstacles (such as water, spiked pits), and fall damage can kill Bubsy in one hit (as he has no health system whatsoever). However, jumping or gliding onto enemies can eliminate them (getting them out of Bubsy's way while giving the player score). Due to the difficulty, there are plenty of checkpoints (for Bubsy to respawn at) and extra lives (as if starting with nine lives, like the cat mythology, is easy enough) scattered around levels. </div> "

Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday,Electronic Arts,Electronic Arts,December 1991[23],genesis,A Gold Box-style RPG set in Earth's near future.  The dominance of the Russo-American Mercantile is put off balance by the emergence of a hero from the past.  Now the player characters continue the struggle to free humanity (in its many forms) from RAM oppression.  ,3030-5771,5771,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/buck-rogers-countdown-to-doomsday/3030-5771/,," <div> Overview : Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday is based on TSR's Buck Rogers XXVC setting created in the late eighties and based on the character whose exploits had been seen in nearly every medium and through several revivals since his debut in 1928. In this adventure, players must help Buck Rogers uncover and destroy a doomsday weapon that could spell the end of resistance to the empire that holds Earth within its grasp.SSI adapted the Buck Rogers setting (another TSR property using the same rules) using the Gold Box Engine that they had pioneered with its work within the Forgotten Realms campaign setting via such titles as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds.Based as it was on the ""Gold Box Engine"", players interfaced with the game via a grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90° turns and movement spaces. Party members were displayed in the upper right hand corner along with hit points and armor class. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes, providing experience.The console variant of the game eschewed the 3D exploration interface in favor of an isometric view instead, although the tactical combat view was still included.The game is a sci-fi role player, although it uses the same rules as AD&D (which was the case with its tabletop original). Classes and weapons are analogous to certain aspects of the system, but it is firmly rooted within its high-tech setting.The packaging, as was typical of SSI's attention to detail as exemplified by their treatment of the Gold Box series of games, took this opportunity to immerse the player within the fiction of its world via an included booklet outlining its history and systems.Included were:The Rule Book (manual)A logbook containing the history leading up from 1990 to 2356 (the date the game takes place) and describing the systems that it uses as well as text paragraphs describing different areas of the gameAnd a data card (a quick-start card on how to get started with the game on specific machines)The main disks of the game could be freely copied, although players would be challenged to find certain words within one of the booklets that the game had come with in order to proceed as a test. This mechanic would also be used in a variety of other games within SSI's RPG lineup.The logbook doubled as a key part of the game as it contained dialogue, scene descriptions, and maps that it would reference. This technique was also used in several other RPGs such as Wasteland and Dragon Wars. As with those titles, Countdown to Doomsday's paragraphs also contained several red herrings designed to mislead players who chose to read ahead and potentially spoil the story for themselves. </div>  <div> Setting : One of the restrictions of the creative credo governing the franchise is that the realism of Buck Rogers' world had to be based on what could be scientifically plausible and possible - hard science as opposed to more fantastic versions. As a result, the series was focused more on the Solar System and the problems associated with terraforming its planets as well as traveling among them.As another result, the history of game reflects this within its protagonists. In 1999, the United States and the Soviet Union engage in a final war, exchanging blows via nuclear weapons. As a result of this terrible conflict, conventional warfare is abandoned and the survivors band themselves into large alliances. The Russo-American Mercantile (RAM) forms out of an alliance between what is left of Russia and the United States, for example. The Indo-Asian Consortium (IAC) and the Euro-Bloc Faction (EBF) also form and become the pre-eminent superpowers of the day.Over the next few centuries, these superpowers form an alliance of their own to expand their efforts into space and colonize the planets. RAM colonizes Mars, the Moon (Luna) is colonized by the EBF, and Venus is colonized by the IAC. Fusion rockets transport men and materials to their destinations throughout the Solar System.In 2275, RAM revolts against an increasingly oppressive Earth government. Venus signs a nonaggression pact with Mars and ten years of war follow. Battered, broken, and cut off from its colonies, Earth starves allowing RAM's forces to dominate what is left. The colonized worlds continue to grow on their own, developing their own unique socieities thanks to the success of their terraforming efforts. for example, Mercury develops a thriving industry based on mining and solar power.Humanity has also changed with its expansion into the Solar System. Earth is still home to those now known as the Terrans. Mercury's people have become strong and powerful. The Martians have become prideful with their successes, and the Venusians have focused more on matters of study and of the mind.However, in the first half of the 25th century, the New Earth Organization is set up by Terrans (Earth natives) that seek to overthrow RAM and restore Earth to its former glory. With the revival of Buck Rogers from cryogenic sleep and with his daring leadership and heroic exploits across the Solar System, NEO manages to thwart RAM's attempts to stop them.High technology has also enabled the construction of robots and Digital Personalities, programs that emulate human thought and emotion but think at the speed of a computer. Genetic engineering on a vast scale has also created tailored creatures found on specific worlds, each made to fulfill either a specific purpose during terraforming or as part of a new product line. As another example, RAM makes use of Combat Gennies, disposable soldiers bred and equipped to fight their wars.This is the world that the player will be caught up within as they do their part to stop RAM and its allies. </div>  <div> Story : The player's party are new NEO recruits and arrive at Chicagorg (formerly Chicago, but far larger) to undergo their final training when it is attacked by RAM troops. If they manage to fend off the attack and save the base, they join efforts to salvage what is left and discover a RAM ship among the wreckage.Entering the ship, they discover a RAM science program named Scot.dos who joins them as he wishes to defect to NEO after having enough of RAM. Onboard, they discover a batch of ECGs (Experimental Combat Gennies), genetically enhanced soldiers, and find a way to stop them before they mature and create problems for Earth. Scot.dos tells them that the ECGs were created on an asteroid base which they go to investigate.At the research facility, they discover other projects that RAM is involved with, one of which happens to be a very powerful, laser-based weapon capable of demolishing entire cities at will. A series of satellite reflectors are also being used as a part of its aiming system, and the party is able to destroy these before heading out to Mars where the weapon is located and a test is scheduled.Unfortunately for them, space pirates under the employ of RAM capture them with the intention of selling them off to their enemies. But Buck Rogers, who has been following a rumor that the pirate leader, Talon, may be employed by RAM, intervenes and helps the party damage the ship to prevent pursuit while they escape.On Mars, they eventually discover the base where a smaller version of the weapon is being tested and destroy it. They also learn that one of the components for the real weapon is being manufactured on Venus and head there to learn more on what is going on, discovering that the Doomsday Laser is housed on a solar satellite (a Mercurian Mariposa) controlled by a Mercurian noble called the Sun King.Believing that the party are actually there to help the Sun King take over the Doomsday Laser for himself, the minions of the Sun King let them pass through security. There, the party discovers that the Laser is already targeting Earth and cause a power outage to delay the countdown. After setting it to self destruct and fighting their way from the core of the Mariposa, they manage to escape and watch as the Marisposa explodes taking the Doomsday Laser with it. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is a party-based RPG using the same engine that SSI had initially built for its Gold Box titles such as Pool of Radiance. As a result, it has many visual cues that make it appear very similar to its more fantastic cousins, but the differences lie mainly within its gameplay conventions.With the use of more conventional armaments, such as laser guns and plasma throwers, ranged attacks have a greater emphasis in this game. The use of grenades and other explosives are considered key to winning many battles quickly. As it is also space-based, the use of that medium has also opened the door on opportunities to attack and board enemy spaceships, often giving them a great deal of loot to recover and sell if need be.Limited dialogue with NPCs, puzzles, and the exploration of bases, secret laboratories, caves, and a variety of other venues are also found throughout the game.Gender is treated only as a cosmetic choice in the game as with many others, but race plays a major part in determining what career a character may be restricted in playing as. </div>  <div> Combat : There are six races that players can choose from in order to build their party. Four of these are considered ""human"" types while two others are ""gennies"", those that have been bred to include certain other attributes that lie outside of the human gene pool.Terrans - These are unengineered humans. They can be a part of any career path and have no distinct weaknesses with fairly average statistics across the board.Venusians - Venus' civilization is a diverse mix of cultures and are often involved as traders, farmers, or herdsmen. They can also be a part of any career path.Martians - They are the oldest and most advanced civilization in the Solar System having benefited from RAM's continuing work there. Because of the lower gravity on Mars, they are slightly weaker than Terrans but equal to most everyone else. Any career path is open to them.Mercurians - Mercury is ruled by the Sun Kings, those descended from the original owners of the great Mariposa solar satellites that orbit the planet, holding court within their palaces. Three other cultures live on the surface of Mercury, descended from the refugees that had fled the chaos of the rest of the Solar System. They can be a part of any career path.Tinkerers - These were bioengineered with lemurs and gibbons to be able to work in small spaces and maintain machinery. As a result, they are very good with technology, but they are restricted to only to careers: Engineer and Medic.Desert Runners - One of the oldest bioengineered races, they were bred to survive on the harsh surface of Mars during its latter terraforming years. They bear feline features from the genetic stock they were mixed with, can run long distances, and fight with their own claws if need be.

The game saw release on multiple platforms, including Amiga, DOS, Sega Genesis, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game starts with the player at the gates of the Tobiko-Ryu Dojo, the training hall headed by Tobiko-Sensei. In order to continue and enter the courtyard, the game requires the player to identify a family crest which is displayed on the screen, typical of the copy protection methodology employed by PC games in those days.The game mechanics are vastly different than what are commonly employed in the 2D fighting game franchises that followed it (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Samurai Shodown, et al). Combat is heavily focused on single strikes from a variety of stances, in which the player fighter engages and disengages by pressing towards and away, respectively. (Movement is handled with the diagonals, down-towards and down-away.)Thus, where other games mix up attacks by employing multiple buttons and mixing in the distance from the opponent, Budokan allows specific control over whether a combatant strikes with (for example) a front kick, side kick, or a reverse roundhouse kick, and whether that kick is aimed at the head, chest or shin, using only the D-pad and a single button. The strike used is determined by (a) the stance engaged to open the attack and (b) the directional button that is pressed at the same time as the Strike button. (Blocking is handled similarly, and requires the same amount of attention to precision with regards to high, medium and low.)Examples:Street Fighter II, Dhalsim's stretch double punch: Stay far away, press Fierce punchStreet Fighter II, Dhalsim's two-hit headbutt: Get in close, press Fierce punchBudokan, Karate side-kick: press away to engage side-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate front-kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press attackBudokan, Karate reverse roundhouse kick: press towards to engage front-kick stance, then press away and attackBudokan, Karate chest punch: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press towardsBudokan, Karate mid-block: press and hold attack to engage punching/blocking stance, then press awayWhile it offers maximum control and is arguably what makes Budokan unique, the mechanics can also be a bit cumbersome and lead to slower, more plodding matches when compared to the faster-moving 2D fighters of today. There are no physics-defying special moves such as fireball or body launcher attacks.Below the stamina meter (which recovers slowly over time), there is a ""Ki"" meter that builds up very slowly whenever a combatant is not attacking, and though it's not really analogous to today's ""Super"" meters, the higher the Ki is when attacking, the harder the strike, after which the Ki empties out. Thus it's entirely possible (though quite difficult) to knock out an adversary in a single strike after defending and withholding attacks long enough to fill up the Ki entirely. </div>  <div> Characters : Throughout the game, there are four different fighting styles. The following styles are available:Karate: Unarmed martial arts styleKendo: Form of Japanese fencing with use of a wooden swordNunchaku: A weapon consisting of two sticks connected by a chain or ropeBo: A long wooden staff </div> "

Hiromi later appeared in the game Namco x Capcom alongside Toby Masuyo from Baraduke. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay in Burning Force Burning Force takes place across six levels or 'days', with each day being split up into four stages. The first two stages put the player into a hoverbike, which can move vertically and speed up or down. Unlike other shoot 'em ups, simply colliding with the enemy does not destroy the player's ship, but knocks them back, leaving them more vulnerable to enemy fire. At the end of the second stage, the player moves into a dropship and receives an upgrade to their bike which allows flight, as well as being briefed on the boss in the next stage, being shown the boss's weakpoints. The third stage allows the player to move around the screen freely, similar to Space Harrier. At the end of the stage, they fight a boss. The fourth stage is a bonus round, where the player can fly through floating balls to collect additional points which is a good place to collect 1-Ups. In the final day, the game moves into a space-shooter, giving the player access to flight across all 4 stages. In the arcade version, credits are used for continues, rather than lives. Upon getting a Game Over, the player can choose to start at any previous level they have completed. There is also a service option where the player can choose to start at any day, up to day five.  </div>  <div> Soundtrack : Lasers: L LaserW Wide-ShotCL Cross LaserMissiles: H Homing MissilesMM Max Missile </div> "

The cabinet supported up to two players (though two cabinets could be ""linked"" for four-player), where each player would control one of four classes much like Gauntlet. The game uses a side-scrolling perspective, and characters can become stronger by defeating enemies and leveling up, or finding and purchasing items. There is also a non-linear element to the game, allowing the player to return to past locations with keys they found for additional items.Cadash was also adapted for the TurboGrafx-16 and the Sega Genesis. The Genesis version reduces the number of characters to choose from to just two, removing the Priestess and Ninja/Rogue. Both console versions allow for two players (using the TurboTap accessory for the TG-16 version). The Arcade version determined the length of time the player could spend on the game with a strict time limit, rather than waiting for the player to game over naturally. As well as by spending more money, this time limit could be extended with special items found in-game, and a special spell that only the Priestess can use. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player, as one of four classes, pass through largely linear 2D side-scrolling stages full of monsters and traps. The game is similar to Nintendo's Zelda II, as it combines a standard platformer/action game with RPG elements; as monsters are defeated, experience is added to the character's meter and they'll eventually level up, gaining more health and doing more damage. Ideally, the player should be leveling up at a rate to match the increased difficulty of the monsters. </div> "

In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor.

Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool,System Vision,Kaneko,January 1993,genesis,Help the Cheetos mascot escape his imprisonment in the Four Corners Zoo by searching for motorcycle parts in this advergame platformer.,3030-13609,13609,0,1992-12-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/chester-cheetah-too-cool-to-fool/3030-13609/,," <div> Overview : Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is the first of two advergames for 16-bit systems that feature the Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah in his own platformer. Too Cool to Fool has Chester passing through a series of stages eating cheesy snacks and avoiding perils.The game was eventually followed up with Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest, also for the Genesis and Super Nintendo. </div>  <div> Story :  Chester Cheetah is being held against his will in the Four Corners Zoo by the zookeeper, Mean Eugene. Chester Cheetah orders a motorcycle from a catalogue to help him escape from the zoo, but Mean Eugene intercepts the package and hides the parts around the zoo. With the help of his friends, The Hip-O and Funky Monkey, Chester must find the parts to his motorcycle so he can ""ditch this zoo and ride away to Hip City, USA."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a fairly straightforward platformer with the only actions available to the player being walk, run and jump. Enemies are dazed (occasionally killed) by being jumped on. Extra lives are gained by collecting one hundred Paw Badges. The factor that differentiates Too Cool to Fool from other platformers is the objective of having to find a motorcycle part in each level. The player can find the exit to each level, but they can't use it until they have found the motorcycle part. </div>  <div> Stages : There are five stages in Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool each with a different theme and different enemies.Stage 1: Four Corners Zoo ParkMy God it's full of sewers! This stage starts with Chester chilling on a bench when Mean Eugene and Grunt, his dog, run by with a box full of Chester's motorcycle parts. Chester leaps off the bench and hops into action. This appears to be an entirely flat plane with a few areaa, but the majority of it takes place underground in a maze of sewer pipes.Stage 2: Monkey Pits This stage has a jungle theme and is a fairly vertical level with lots of vines and trees to climb. Funky Monkey helps Chester in this level by jumping on enemies and retrieving the motorcycle from a branch that Chester can't reach.Stage 3: Gator Alley A very horizontal level taking place over water that is filled with enemies and areas where Chester will fall into the water. The Hip-O helps Chester by acting as a moving platform so he can cross some water. There is a lengthy boat section where Chester must avoid Mean Eugene's boat and some logs.Stage 4: Hidden CavesA cave stage filled with bats and boulder punching pigs. This level has many pitfalls that will cause the player to be looped back to the beginning of the stage. It also has a lengthy  mine cart sequence that, like the boat section in the previous level, involves dodging Mean Eugene.Stage 5: Bird HouseThe first seconds of this level take place on a jungle canopy but as soon as you can say ""Dangerously Cheesy"" Chester is launched onto the back of a large butterfly-like creature and the beginning of an incredibly long flying sequence begins. Mean Eugene attacks in a helicopter with rockets, but is finally defeated for good and Chester grabs the final part of his motorcycle.  </div>  <div> Power-ups : There are a number of items that can be grabbed that help Chester in his muffler-hunting quest.Cheetah Paw: This health restoring item resembles one of the cheeto paw snakes that were in production in the early nineties. This is surprisingly the only possible reference to cheetos in the game.Sunglasses: Although Chester is always wearing sunglasses, he can grab this additional pair to turn the screen monochrome and reveal hidden badges.Guitar: This guitar will make Chester invulnerable as he rocks out. The problem with this item is that it relinquishes control from the player as Chester stands in one spot and takes a few hops to the left and right. In one stage grabbing the guitar will cause Chester to jump off the platform he is on and get damaged by water.Sneakers: These give Chester the ability to dash by holding down a button. When dashing Chester can jump a considerable distance. Until the Chester gets these he can only walk at a pace that should make him ashamed to call himself a cheetah.Skateboards: The skateboard will bring Chester to the bonus stage. In the bonus stage Chester rides the motor powered skateboard to collect as many badges as possible.Paw Badges: The standard  collectible. Get one hundred and get an extra life.  </div>  <div> Manual :  Don't walk, run! To buy some Cheetos brand corn snacks!Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool comes with a gem of a manual. Not only is it filled with  Engrish, but the writers have attempted to have every line rhyme. This leads to sentences such as ""Good gain by swipin' the motorcycle frame!"" and ""If you're hip and brave enough, check out these Hidden Caves and stuff.""The manual also has a coupon for 50 cents off a bag of paw shaped Cheetos. The coupon expires 12/31/93. </div> "
Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild Quest,Kaneko,Kaneko,February 1994,genesis,"The second 16-bit game featuring Cheetos' mascot Chester Cheetah.

Like the first, Too Cool to Fool, Wild Wild West is a side-scrolling platformer that pits Chester Cheetah against his old nemesis Mean Eugene the zookeeper as well as various other less-than-cool humans and animals. He can collect one-use items that will help him survive, and the player can determine which stage he visits next via a map of the USA. </div>  <div> Story : Well, it finally happened. Chester Cheetah escaped captivity at the zoo and was cruising down the road on his awesome motorcycle following his map to Hip City. Suddenly, Mean Eugene stole his map, ripped it to pieces, and scattered them across the United States. He needs to recover all the pieces by travelling the breadth of the continent, avoiding Mean Eugene all the while. Because, after all...it's not easy being cheesy. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Chester on the way to 7-Eleven for some CheetosThe gameplay in Wild Wild Quest is fairly different than its prequel. The mechanics and sprites are completely redone and, in most cases, of much higher quality. For example, the artists went through the trouble to put shading on things.Now that he's out of the zoo Chester has decided to add a bit of pep to his walk and goes at about twice the speed that he did in Too Cool to Fool. Chester can also dash without the need for a power-up and perform super jumps. Chester is a fragile kitty though and will die after one hit if he isn't carrying a bag of Cheetos Brand Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks. </div>  <div> Levels : Levels are selected from a level select screen modeled on a US map. The player chooses a starting level and from there can choose from the level to the left or right of the level they just played.In each level Chester must find the map piece before the timer runs out. Once the map piece is found Chester has to find his way to the ""GOAL"" sign at the end of the level. Each level has a bizarre boss fight after the player reaches the goal.Euphreaka: Located in Northern California this beachy level is filled with palm trees, vultures and a very angry fat beach lady.Quakers-Field: This Californian town is filled with orchards, junked cars and buildings of questionable sturdiness.Omahog: A farm level based in Nebraska.Lostin: This town in Massachusetts is filled to the brim with water, pirates and ships.Numb: Chester makes his way up north to Alaska to slide around on the ice and enjoy the auroras.Wall Up: New Mexico's finest sombrero'd cacti watch as Chester runs through this desert.Little Shock: Chester must navigate his way through this power plant in the heart of Arkansas.Un-Clearwater: Will Florida's swamps thwart Chester's need for a map piece?Not-So-Great-Falls: Lots of hyphens don't keep this mountainous Montana level down.Rally: Once Chester gets all of the map pieces he makes his way to North Carolina to beat Mean Eugene in a NASCAR race. This is less of a level and more of a final boss stage. </div>  <div> Collectibles : It's almost like this game is an ad for Cheetos or something...Cheeto Paw: Levels are filled with Cheeto paws of all sizes. Although they are counted, they don't give you any extra lives, just lots of points.Bag of Cheetos: Unlike Too Cool to Fool, this game actually contains Cheetos. If Chester is carrying a bag of these he won't die when he gets hit by an enemy.Map Piece: One in each level, Chester needs this to finish a level.Friend Icon: There are several icons in each level representing one of Chester's animal friends. They give you points. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores 6,9,8,8 stating, ""...Great animations, especially the guitar playing, along with a decent quest and a lot of different levels to keep the game rockin'. A definite winner"". </div> "

Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game. </div> "

Originally released as a rental exclusive for Blockbuster Video stores (and later released through normal means), this version fixed some glitches while adding new game modes (including multiple tournament-based modes), revamped stages, a flashy new intro, and new options.

This port would later see a digital re-release for the Wii (via Virtual Console) on May 25, 2009.Along with developing their sister claymation platformer Claymates, Interplay would turn ClayFighter into a series spawning two sequel installments: ClayFighter 2: Judgement Clay and ClayFighter 63⅓.

In addition, players can hinder opponents by ""flash jewels"" (which deal a random detriment to them, such as making the pieces monochrome or reversing the player's joy-pad).The game's single-player mode, also known as Pyramid Columns, has players delving deep into an ancient pyramid for treasure, facing off against numerous creatures. Along the way, they can earn items to help them defeat their opponent (which can be activated by pausing the game).It also includes free-for-all multiplayer supporting up to five players, where two attack buttons are used: one to attack the player on their left and one to attack the player on their right.

He is able to use the environment to his advantage by knocking explosive boxes at enemies, or by ripping a piece of paper and turning it into a deadly paper plane. Sketch has a trusty sidekick in the form of his pet rat, Roadkill. Roadkill has the ability to stun enemies and can help find hidden items/solve puzzles. Sketch isn't limited to fighting with his bare hands though; he can pick up various items throughout the game such as bombs, grenades, knives and more. The game takes place across three episodes (split into two parts) and each episode ends with a boss fight. The game features multiple endings based solely around the outcome of the final fight with Mortus.Comix Zone is considered to be a cult-classic for it's unique comic book concept and style. It was released rather late in the Genesis's life cycle and because of that it didn't sell well. It has more recently been re-released on the Wii's Virtual Console and as a part of both the Sega Genesis Collection (PS2/PSP) and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (360/PS3). Most recently the game was ported to XBLA as part of Sega's Vintage Compilation promotion. </div>  <div> Story : The player assumes the role of Sketch Turner, a starving artist who gets sucked into his newest comic (Comix Zone) during a lightning storm. At the same time Mortus, main villain of his comic, manages to escape and now Sketch must find a way back to the real world. Mortus plans to free himself completely by killing Sketch while he's inside the comic and he does this by sketching in enemies among other things. When Sketch initially wakes inside of Comix Zone he meets Alyssa Cyan, a general who believes Sketch is their savior. Sketch is a bit reluctant to fight, but he knows that he doesn't have much of a choice. As he fights through the comic book he will inevitably have a final showdown with Mortus.  </div>  <div> Episodes : Episode 1: Night of the MutantsEpisode 2: Welcome to the TempleEpisode 3: Curse of the Dead Ships </div>  <div> Music : Music for the game was composed by Howard Drossin. </div>  <div> Special Notes : Comix Zone was originally designed with a 6-button controller in mind and that is the way it's meant to be played. With a 6-button controller the X/Y/Z buttons each correspond to a separate item slot and the C-button is used for blocking (by default), or a special action which can be selected in the options menu. On a 3-button controller the C-button is used to cycle through items and pressing the A-button will use the highlighted weapon (blocking is automatic).If the player kills all the enemies in a panel and repeatedly press down on the d-pad, Sketch will fart.When the attack button is held, Sketch will tear a piece of paper from the background of the comic and fashion it into a paper plane, which he then throws at enemies and destructible objects. This action consumes a portion of his life.Sketch's rat (Roadkill) can find hidden weapons, pull levers, and electrocute enemies - doing a small amount of damage. A particular enemy in the game has a phobia of rats that can be exploited. </div> "

The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of ""spots"" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. ""Spots"" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game. </div> "

It was one of the first computer (or video) games to use fully recorded samples for  voices and sound effects, and although they were small in number the corresponding effects for yammering  mutants and dizzy  Prince Duncan were quite remarkable, especially when combined with the detailed backgrounds.The game starts with Prince Duncan entering the Black Knight's castle and the gate slams shuts behind him. In order to escape, Duncan has to trek through  caves, dungeons, and a tower surrounded by perpetual lightning clouds before he's well equipped enough to take on the Black Knight himself.The game uses a WASD control scheme, uses Q to duck, and jump with the spacebar and aim and throw rocks with the mouse. There was a later Sega Genesis version that featured color, but the horrific controls implemented for rock throwing almost made the game unplayable due to lack of accuracy. </div>  <div> The Levels : Great HallOnce inside the castle Duncan is presented with four exits - two doors on the left, a main double-door in the center and a narrow staircase up on the right side. Each is accessed by tapping the corresponding number key.The first two doors are random. There is a 50% chance of exiting the side of the castle and embarking on a brief journey to earn  fireballs, and a 50% chance of getting thrown down to the dungeon. </div>  <div> The Enemies : Unfortunately, if Duncan ends up in the dungeon, the door locks behind him and he must trek through three screens, get the key, and trek back again, and make overall zero progress.Final area of dungeon (or first, if you fall in)Duncan will also end up in the dungeon if he falls into any of the game's pits - they are far fewer in number than in the original, though, as there are only two or three screens (of more than a dozen) that lead to the dungeon. Once there, Duncan must  sneak up on the  torturer, whack him on the back of the head with a morningstar, then leap over his unconscious body and grab the correct key before leaping back again. Time it wrong, grab the wrong key, or take too long and allow him to wake up again, and Duncan is dead.  </div>  <div> Trivia : If Duncan does get the correct door, he will cross a small plain guarded by rock-throwing, gurgling mutants that constantly respawn and  climb three sets of ropes (allowing him to swap between them to avoid mutants climbing down). The following room has a number of moving platforms, requiring very careful jumping. It's the first area where use of the games' different jumps becomes essential - Prince Duncan jumps higher, lower, or longer depending on the direction held while tapping jump, and he cannot fall like  Mario. Falling more than twice his height will almost always result in death.Once past the platforming segment there is a brief river rapids through dank tunnels and finally Duncan meets up with the reclusive  wizard, who will gently anoint him with the gift of fireballs, allowing him to throw them instead of regular rocks. Of course, if Duncan reaches him without first obtaining the shield from the lightning tower, his magic spell will instead char him to a crisp. </div> "

The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems. </div>  <div> Story : A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the ""Madman"" himself. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive. </div>  <div> Ports : Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay. </div> "

Based on the Dick Tracy franchise, the game picks up after the end of the NES game, with Big Boy breaking out of prison and plotting his revenge on Tracy. Eschewing the open world and investigation aspects of its predecessor, this game offers a simpler, more linear experience, focused on action and platforming. </div>  <div> Story : The game starts some time after the Dick Tracy NES game, with The City at peace as mob kingpin Alphonse ""Big Boy"" Caprice is locked away in the state penitentiary after Tracy got him on the hook for bank robbery. It proves short lived though, as Big Boy escapes and a crime wave is unleashed upon its streets. Determined to restore order and put Big Boy back behind bars, Tracy goes after Shoulders, the last person to visit him in prison. The detective finds Shoulders trying to dispose of a photo showing The Brow facilitating the escape, and wastes no time heading for the henchman's train yard hideout.At the yard, he finds another photo, this time of Big Boy robbing a safe, and corners The Brow demanding some answers. The Brow claims the photos were all taken by Pruneface, who was blackmailing them. And ominously, he suggests there are more photos, some of which should worry Tracy himself. Mulling over the mobsters words, Tracy heads to the Harbor to track down the blackmailer.Prunceface readily admits to the deed, but gives Tracy something else to think about with a photo of hitman Flattop at the Club Ritz... together with Tracy's true love Tess Trueheart. Worried, Tracy rushes to the Ritz. As he corners Flattop, the gangster gloats as Tracy sees the final photo - Big Boy posing with a captured Tess - and reveals it was all a ruse to lure him into a trap.Now faced with with the full force of Big Boy's gang, Tracy fights his way to the drawbridge gearhouse the kingpin is holding Tess in. After a long battle, Tracy is victorious, and Big Boy breaks down in front of him, offering riches and pleading for mercy. Furious, Tracy instead sends him flying into the river. The game ends with Tess and Tracy embracing under the moonlight, and Tess suggesting the two go out for chili. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Game Boy Dick Tracy is a linear side-scrolling action platformer. Lacking the open world and investigation aspects of the NES game, it instead offers more complex level design due to the addition of vertical scrolling. It keeps the inventory system of its predecessor, but as items are far more common, resource management is rarely an issue. Other changes that contribute to a generally lower degree of difficulty include extra lives and frequent checkpoints, unlimited continues, and no penalties for shooting unarmed opponents.A mechanic new to the game is the collection of photo pieces, heavily tied in to the game's storyline. There are 12 of them in each levels except the last, both hidden in the environment and dropped by enemies. Once Tracy has defeated the level's boss, he 2 minutes to piece them together, and can gain extra health, bonus time and additional lives depending on how many pieces are in their correct place.Tracy starts out with 5 hearts of health and 3 lives. He can pick up items found in the open, hidden inside crates or dropped from enemies, including hearts, hand guns, tommy guns, tear gas and grenades. </div>  <div> Levels : The game has 5 levels, with 3 to 4 areas each. Each level has a time limit, which can be extended by picking up clock items placed throughout the game.LevelEnvironmentBoss1-1Streets1-2Residence1-3Sewer1-4SewerShoulders2-1Industrial2-2Train Yard2-3Train YardThe Brow3-1Harbor3-2Sewer3-3SewerPruneface4-1Club Ritz4-2Backstage4-3BackstageFlattop5-1Harbor5-2Industrial5-3Gearhouse5-4GearhouseBig Boy </div> "

Disney's Aladdin,Virgin Games,Sega,"November 11, 1993",genesis,"Disney's Aladdin was the title of several different games from different developers based on the classic Disney film, Aladdin.

One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills). </div>  <div> Story : The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, ""What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained..."".Danyon Carpenter wrote, ""...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation..."". </div> "

The game is loosely based on the 1994 film of the same name, borrowing many elements from it (such as having crime lord Shuko as the main antagonist and turning damsel-in-distress Marian into a gang leader) and using small snippets of the film itself.When  Billy Lee and  Jimmy Lee receive a letter from their old martial arts instructor, they decide to return to their hometown after leaving for ten years. After finding out that the town is completely controlled by violent gangs led by crime lord Koga Shuko, the Lee brothers set out to stop the violence.The game was later released for the Neo Geo AVS on March 31, 1995 and ported to the Neo Geo CD on June 2, 1995 (featuring a vocal-laden arranged soundtrack). It was later ported to the Sony PlayStation by Urban Plant on April 26, 1996 exclusive to Japan. This version includes two new game modes: ""Overdrive"" (which is a slightly faster version of the game) and ""Tiny 3D"" (which allows the player to move the camera around, showing the different layers of the background and foreground to give the illusion of 3D).

Developed by East Technology and published by Technos Japan Corp., Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone has since been released on a wide variety of platforms, with numerous differences between ports. Typically regarded as one of the worst games in the franchise, Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone is often criticized for its shop system, unnecessarily difficult bosses, and lowered graphical quality. Despite this, the NES version received mostly positive reviews, due to the more direct attention from Technōs Japan Corp.The soundtrack for Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone was released in Japan on June 21, 1991. Distributed by Pony Canyon, the soundtrack for Double Dragon III is actually a compilation of Double Dragon III's soundtrack and The Combatribes soundtrack, with twelve tracks from the arcade version of Double Dragon III. Included on the soundtrack are several of the original songs, as well as some arranged versions of the songs.Double Dragon III / The Combatribes SoundtrackThe Rosetta StoneThe New Black WarriorsJim's ThemeLi's ThemeRanzou's ThemeGiuliano's ThemeEnter the DragonThe Fearsome GoblinAwakening of the 2,000 Year Old DemonTo the Children of the WorldPlay Version </div>  <div> Gameplay : Hiruko, the fortune teller that the brothers meet.Titled Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone in the arcade, this game once again follows Billy and Jimmy Lee, the series' stars. In this game, they are returning home after a vacation, and encounter a fortune teller, whose name is Hiruko. Hiruko tells them that they must fight a mysterious enemy stationed in Egypt, and in order to do so they must first collect all three of the Rosetta Stones. Thus, Billy and Jimmy set out on their quest to recover the three Rosetta Stones.Similar to previous Double Dragon games, Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Double Dragon III returns to the gameplay format established in the first Double Dragon. Rather than featuring the directional based attacks of Double Dragon II: The Revenge, Double Dragon III uses the punch and kick buttons that were used in the first game. Additionally, Double Dragon III removes many special moves, but adds its own, including a throwing move and a headbutt.The shopA new feature in Double Dragon III are weapon stores, where players can buy new power-ups and abilities for the characters. The thing that was heavily criticized about this feature was the fact that it cost actual credits in order to purchase these, requiring players to insert in more coins if they want to buy items, new playable characters, or improved abilities (agility, health, etc). The three extra character duos available in this mode are Urquidez, Chin, and Oyama (all three are pairs of brothers). In the Japanese version of the game, all of these things are available before purchasing them in the shop, as that feature is absent from the Japanese version. </div>  <div> Trivia : Double Dragon III on the NES only gives players a single life.Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in January of 1991 in North America by Acclaim Entertainment, February 22, 1991 in Japan, and was later published by Bandai in Europe. Very different from the arcade version of the game, Double Dragon III is similar to the other NES ports in the franchise. The plot is similar, but rather than searching for the Rosetta Stones, Billy and Jimmy are searching for the Sacred Stones in order to rescue Marian, who has been kidnapped again. Additionally, the final boss is no longer Cleopatra (in the arcade version), instead a possessed version of Marian named Queen Noiram.Naturally, the game is incredibly difficult. The game only grants players a single life (although in cooperative play, each player has two lives). If the player manages to beat the entire game, beating the final boss will unlock two new characters, previously found in the arcade version of Double Dragon III. Beating the final boss unlocks the characters Chin Seimei and Yagyu Ranzou.Players can swap characters at any time.Another new feature of Double Dragon III involves special attacks and weapons. Not only does each character now have their own weapon that can be equipped from the sub menu (as well as using weapons dropped by enemies; this feature was in previous games), but when playing in cooperative mode, players can perform special attacks that every character participates in, such as headbutts and somersaults. Also relating to the cooperative mode, players can now switch available characters at any time, making it possible to switch characters when one player is getting low on health. </div> "

The Genesis version allows for a three-button layout, where allowing players to press the start button to switch between kicking and punching.Special moves are activated by holding down one direction, and then quickly shifting directions and hitting a certain button (e.g. holding left for two seconds, quickly pressing down and punch simultaneously will unleash a special attack from Jimmy Lee). This combination of button inputs was criticized by fans and critics who found it strange to have to quickly switch directions without sliding the control pad.The Quest Mode takes players through a story.There are several modes available in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls. Tournament Mode is the default single player fighting mode, in which the player can fight through every character in the game in a random order. The multiplayer mode, VS. Mode, is a traditional two-player arena fighting mode, allowing players to choose whichever character they want. There is a second single player mode, Quest Mode, which adds a story, but is essentially the same as Tournament Mode. Quest Mode has two stories available; the Lee brothers fighting the Shadow Master, or one of the Shadow Warriors fighting to become his apprentice. Additionally, there is a mode that allows players to choose two computer controlled characters, and watch them fight each other.Another feature of Double Dragon V are Overkills, which are finishing moves that give a different losing animation for the defeated character. Each character has a special animation, triggered when they are killed with a specific attack. For example, the Lee brothers' Overkill is a flash of light, leaving the Lee brothers as a skeleton, with only their sword remaining. </div>  <div> Characters : The base game includes 12 playable characters, two of which are bosses that must be unlocked prior to play.

Though a more direct English translation of Puyo Puyo's Game Gear port titled ""Puzlow Kids"" was developed, the decision was ultimately made to change the game's aesthetics; allegedly, this was due to the belief that Westerners wouldn't accept a game featuring a little girl as the protagonist. The characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari series were replaced with characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, a cartoon series based on the Sonic franchise.More than a year later, Puyo Puyo's Super Famicom port was reskinned with a Kirby theme and released as Kirby's Avalanche. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Colored beans fall from the top of the screen and must be cleared by connecting four or more beans of the same color.

The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles. </div>  <div> Story : Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, ""New Junk City"". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blasterJim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping. </div>  <div> Planets : Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck. </div>  <div> Avatar Awards : Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue. </div> "

One of the first few things is that Jim does have a new friend called Snot and he can use him as a grapple like hook to get to some extra parts of the level. But in order to use Snot, the player must find green spots on top of certain areas in the level that he can attach to. Replacing Jim's copter from the last game, Jim can use Snot to float down to other areas in order to catch himself.There is also some added items for Jim to collect and other weapons in this game. Jim can now collect Can O' Worms this time around by going into hidden areas in the level as well as collect health that goes up to 200%.

Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.In Ecco’s future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with ‘skyways’ or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astrite’s last two globes and went back to the present.The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time. </div> "

The major issue for the consumer being the original genesis controller consisted of 3 buttons, pressuring users to purchase a 6 button controller or joystick. With the 3 button control scheme, the user was required to awkwardly hit the start button to swap between punches and kicks.Depending on the distance of the opponent, a button press would automatically adjust for location. For example pressing A would result in a kick, but in close quarters the same button press would result in a knee. Each character had a large set of special moves. To prevent constant use of special moves (similar to The Art of Fighting), the game adopted a stamina system called “Inner Strength”. An inner strength orb indicator appeared on screen as a Ying Yang symbol. Each special move would decrease the orb by a certain percentage. If the orb was depleted, the gamer had to fight without special moves until it completely recharged.Trident's Stage OverkillThe game also adopted stage fatalities of Mortal Kombat called Overkills. If an opponent was knocked down from the appropriate location, into the correct spot a stage specific overkill occurred. For example, in Tridents level the player was required to stand on the left hand side of the mermaid statue, knocking down their opponent facing them from the right. If done correctly the downed opponent would be hauled into the water by vines, losing their remaining life while only blood surfaced. </div>  <div> Characters : Shadow Yamoto (a Japanese ninja assassin from 1993 A.D.)Larcen Tyler (a Chicago mob burglar from 1920 A.D.)R.A.X.

It is based on the Ex-Mutants comic book series by Malibu Comics (who originally picked the series up from Eternity Comics) and was developed by Malibu's in-house game development wing, Malibu Interactive. Ex-Mutants is set in the post-apocalypse where all of humanity has been transformed into mutants by the radioactive fallout and biological warfare left behind by World War III. A group of strong, young mutants - a group of three males and three females - are transformed back into humans via a process pioneered by the cyborg Professor Kildare. They now protect the shattered world from warlords and villains while looking for a way to restore the rest of mankind. In the game's story, all the Ex-Mutants except Ackroyd and Shannon have been captured by the evil Sluggo and his subordinate Zygote and placed in various spots to lure the remaining two into a trap.

EXO Squad,Novotrade,Playmates Interactive EntertainmentNAVirgin InteractiveEU,May 1995,genesis,A licensed Genesis action game based on a very bizarre cartoon about robots and slavery. It features a mix of game play styles that tie into the three characters playable in the game.,3030-22966,22966,0,1995-05-19,https://www.giantbomb.com/exo-squad/3030-22966/,," <div> Overview : The gang's all hereEXO Squad is a game for the Sega Genesis made in 1995. It was developed by Novotrade International, who later became Appaloosa Interactive, and published by Playmates Interactive Entertainment Ltd..  Based on the popular cartoon, the game follows three of the main characters of the show- J.T. Marsh, Wolf Bronski, and Rita Torres- before the events of the show actually take place. Each character has unique game play styles and objectives, although they fall into action gameplay stereo types. The game animates and plays very similarly to a another Novotrade game for the Genesis, Cyborg Justice, and has gameplay elements of both that and Sega arcade classic After Burner.A basic cut sceneThe most notable aspect of the game is the single player mode's heavy reliance on narrative in the game. Cutscenes are extensively used during the single player campaign, with each level having a rough explanation for what is taking place in the game. These usually consist of still pictures with scrolling text, but on occasion include frames of animation for, say, the narrowing of eyes in response to a question posed by the events at hand, or just generally talking. Every mission ends with a password and another cut scene, giving a rough link to the next mission at hand. This serves to feel a lot like the source material, with the same kind of post-event jumps that do not show the aftermath of whatever event is taking place.   </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gameplay divides itself into two different modes, Arcade Mode and Duel Mode. Story mode is the single player component of the game, where the player guides the three characters through an unfolding narrative involving time travel, bioengineering, and man-made super humans named Neosapiens.The gameplay has a few overarching elements. Every game style has the same health system, a radial dial in the top left corner that moves counter clockwise as you lose health. The dial can contain eleven tanks, or rotations, around the circle. Full health is marked with an F, for full, and from there it counts down from F to zero. By the time the last lap is completed on the zero, the character explodes and the level resets. Check points are very rare, and progression is managed through passwords instead of a battery save. The game only utilizes the A, B, and C buttons on the Genesis controller, with no support for six button controls.J.T.'s GameplayJ.T. Marsh's gameplay consists of Afterburner style flight combat. Using the D-Pad, the player moves from left to right, the up and down arrows serving to move JT from one horizontal plane of play to another. J.T. had a standard arsenal compared to the rest of the characters. The A button would fire a regular gatling gun, and the B button, when held, charged a cannon. It was possible to fire the machine gun while charging the cannon, and is definitely a useful strategy for later in the levels. The C button engages evasive manuvering, allowing the player to move much faster and outrun lock-ons that boss characters, which were other Exoskeletal robots (entitled E-Frames) piloted by villainous Neo Sapiens. The boss characters only have one attack, which consist of powerful gatling guns that lock on and deplete health incredibly quickly. If the lock on is not evaded, the fight can be ended in mere seconds.Wolf's GameplayWolf's gameplay strongly resembles the side scrolling elements of Cyborg Justice, mostly due to the animation style. Wolf walks his E-Frame from left to right, powering through opposition with heavy weapons fire. The D-Pad has two functions: Wolf only moves forwards if told, but he crouches by pressing Left. The game does not allow the player to turn around in these levels. Up and down on the D-Pad are used to move Wolf's crosshairs up and down, allowing him to aim at targets. The A button initiates a shield that causes Wolf to glow blue and reflect most damage, the exceptions being direct contact with enemies and missiles. The B button serves as both his gatling gun and cannon. Pressing B fires the regular gun, while holding and then releasing B causes the cannon to discharge. The C button is used to jump, mainly over obstacles like pits. Bossfights for Wolf's levels consist of heavily armed E-Frames remaining stationary and firing upon Wolf, with simple patterns.Rita's GameplayRita's gameplay is a side scrolling duel between two E-Frames, hers and an enemy's. The tutorial is left to be very vague, which encourages discovery. The gameplay in these stages is by far the most entertaining of the three. The D-Pad is directional movement, with the up button causing the E-Frame to begin to hover. The A button doubles as both the shield and a large, overhanded slamming punch. The B button also pulls double duty, serving as projectiles (cannon or missiles, depending on how long the gun is charged) and also straight punches and lunges. The C button is used for complicated manuvers and attacks, and needs input from the D-Pad to function at it's best. Up and C causes RIta to do a front flipping kick. Forward and C initiates a large dashing knee attack. Backwards and C is a form of teleport, where the E-Frame dashes to the other side of the screen, turns around, and fires a downward shot. Down and C makes the player lay down. From here, the player can dodge the charged shots like missiles, shoot the cannon, or lift a foot and kick an approaching apponent.The most interesting thing about Rita's stages is the counter-active nature of all the attacks. Moves have priority, and it is established through common sense instead of rules. For instance, while the front flip kick will leap over the ducking lunge, the attacker is left open for the overhand strike. Laying down makes the player an ample target for the teleport fire, and on and on. The gameplay of these stages is so solid that it seves as the game's multiplayer mode, randomly shuffling between three enemy E-Frames, Wolf, and Rita. </div> "

Similar to Delphine's earlier title Out of This World, Flashback is notable for its use of rotoscoped animation, allowing for a visually fluid representation of the characters' various movements.The game was first released on floppy diskette for the Amiga, a home computer popular in Delphine's native France; it was eventually ported to MS-DOS, SNES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. A CD-ROM version was later released for MS-DOS, Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns in 1994.

Conrad jumps onto a hoverbike and temporarily evades his assailants; however, a much larger transport soon gives chase and quickly blasts Conrad's vehicle out of the sky. After a brief search of the crash area, the armed transport flies off, leaving Conrad for dead in the depths of an unknown jungle. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Flashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game. </div> "

In arcades, the game was released in three cabinet variants; a standard standup version, a sit-down version and the custom sitdown R-360 cabinet. The R-360 was able to rotate freely on two axes, allowing the cabinet to mimic in-game action, including turning the cabinet completely upside down. Due to the impressiveness of the R-360 cabinet the home computer versions (Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Amiga) were named G-LOC R360.Some ports of the game included features not present in the arcade version.

Released on December 26th, 1990 in Japan, it was later brought to North American markets by way of publisher Renovation in early 1991.Other than being fairly difficult, Gaiares is most known for its unique weapon-leeching mechanic. Instead of relying on traditional power-ups as shooters usually do, the option-like drone (called TOZ) can be launched outward toward enemy craft with the C button, bringing back one of many weapons for the player's ship to use. To expand on this feature, the game also features three power-levels to these weapons; this means being able to leech from the same type of enemy multiple times to increase its power. </div>  <div> Story : The game also has minimally animated anime-styled cutscenes with dialog at the beginning and end of the game, which serve to frame the game's story to the player, and provide a satisfying conclusion to the mayhem.

Players control the eponymous furry feline as he becomes trapped inside his poorly-reassembled television set by a sentient set of spare pieces (known as the Glitch).

The player controls Goliath, (voiced by Keith David) leader of the Gargoyles Manhattan clan, on a journey to catch Demona and prevent her from using the Eye of Odin.There are virtually no connections to the television series's storyline. Only the aforementioned characters appear in any fashion. Most of the game takes place during the first century A.D. before the titular gargoyles are turned to stone for 1000 years to eventually be awakened in episode one of the show. As such, the player defends Castle Wyvern against an army of vikings... and also giant, evil robots. Like the show itself, the game targeted young teenagers and dealt with many mature story themes rarely seen in a side-scroller at the time. The storyline is widely considered to be non-canon.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Gargoyles plays similarly to most other 2D action games of that era. The player is essentially moving from left to right on every level and there is an abundance of platforms to jump and enemies to attack. It is worth noting that Gargoyles is an incredibly tough game, even by the standards of that time and there is no continue/save system.  </div>  <div> Reception : Gargoyles did not fare very well in terms of sales or critical reception. As a result, the planned SNES version of the game was never released. </div> "

Players raise armies of knights and cavalry and supplements them with fantastical creatures like dragons and gargoyles in order to take control of the nation of Ishmeria.The game was released on MSX, NES, SNES, Genesis, FM Towns Marty, the NEC PC-9801 and MS-DOS PCs. The NES, SNES and Genesis versions were released in the US. In Japan the game is known as Royal Blood, or Super Royal Blood in the case of the SNES version. </div>  <div> Story : Gemfire takes place on the fictional, war-torn island of Ishmeria. The Gemfire is a crown adorned with seven jewels, each one containing a powerful being. Six of the seven jewels are wizards, the seventh being a vengeful fire dragon. The wizards were sealed inside gems as they fought to save Ishmeria. Their ultimate sacrifice trapped the dragon in a ruby, but they could not escape the spell. The King of Ishmeria turned the seven gems into a crown and used its power to bring peace to the island. When he died, his son Eselred took power.Eselred used the crown to exact a tyrannical rule. His daughter, Princess Robyn -- encouraged by the whispers of Pastha the water dragon (who once fought alongside the trapped wizards) -- destroyed the Gemfire to thwart her father's oppression.Breaking the crown scattered the gems to the far corners of Ishmeria where the island's rebellious families found and used the wizards inside to aid their quest to overthrow Eselred and unite the country in peace. </div>  <div> Gameplay : When the game starts, players have their choice of four scenarios: Erin & Ander, Flax's Shame,Terian's War, and Gemfire. While Ishmeria's shape never changes, these four scenarios change which families are in play and what provinces they control at the start of the game.Gemfire's gameplay is a mixture of stat management and basic turn-based strategy. Between battle sequences, players manage their crops, troop counts, and loyalty. Waging and winning battles depends on having adequate food stores and finances.While managing stats, the player's provinces are randomly selected. The home province, where the head of the chosen family resides, controls alliances and appointing vassals to outlying territories. All controlled places can build their troops, protect their land, and hire fifth units. They cannot make or break alliances, but they can persuade vassals from other families to defect.Each character has a unique set of stats, or character facts. Their influence over battle and cultivation is determined by their Leadership, Command ability, Charm, and Fame. The higher the score, the better they perform.Leadership: ability to protect and develop a province.Command: ability on the battlefieldCharm: Charming leaders are better at persuading alliances and new recruits.Fame: Fame grows with good deeds and is important for carrying out secret missions and recruiting vassals. </div> "

Before each battle the player must select from pre-assembled squads with different combination of grenadiers, flamethrowers, machine gunners etc... Character movement and action is controlled using a cursor to point and click on new locations or enemy combatants. The exception to this is when the player selects a two person squad which can be controlled in freely in real time with the D-pad.Each character only has one fire mode, but each also handles differently. There were also Medics available to revive downed allies, however the use is limited. Additionally, units like the Launcher can kill characters outright, with no chance for revival. Other options included side objectives on a few of the maps. These usually involve either destroying or defending a rail car or helicopter, and yielding a small bonus if successful.Common battlefield skirmishGeneral Chaos features a two player co-op mode where each player can control two of the commando classes versus five computer controlled AI players and a four player mode with the multiplayer adapter. Each skirmish takes place on a small battlefield region. Each regions connects together to make the world map - much like a game of RISK. Upon winning, the victorious side will capture the region of the world map and will be allowed to progress to the next tier of skirmishes. As new regions are unlocked the players advance towards the enemies capital city and after completing the final battle eventually sacks the capital, completing the game. After completion the game will reset the world map and the human players can choose to play through the game again on a harder difficulty. </div>  <div> Story : The brief backstory, discovered mostly through the game manual, revolves around Generals Chaos and Havoc, two brothers raised in a military family. Growing up skirmishing against each other until they each became commanders of opposing forces. Generals Havoc and Chaos fought with large armies, causing vast destruction and casualties, but ended in a stalemate. They finally developed the idea of small teams of commando style units, and set out to end the conflict. </div>  <div> Game Mechanics : Occasionally, if two combatants run next to each other, they will be enveloped in a dust cloud and have some sort of scuffle. At times, this would lead to a ""Close Quarters Combat"" encounter. Each player has at their disposal: a high, medium, low punch and kick, as well as a block. Theoretically, each has a varying strategic use (e.g. a high attack does more damage but is easier to interrupt, while a low attack does less damage but comes in faster).The computer AI at times simply forces a win by repeatedly throwing punches faster than the player can block. Also, the low punch is oddly a groin punch, which doesn't fit at all with the machismo of the game.Rampant spamming of a single attack to win a close quarters combat match can sometimes result in the attacking player being shot by the opponent with a pistol after it appeared the victim was defeated. </div>  <div> Classes : Each side had one medic per round that could be called in to revive a downed player. Once selected, the cursor turns into a cross and can be placed on a downed character, the medic then runs in from offscreen and performs CPR. The downed character is then revived with lowered health.While medics are invincible to fire, players can position themselves so as to kill a revived player as soon as they stand up. </div>  <div> Trivia : Characters are able to take several hits before dying, however many explosive weapons would cause them to fall. Once players had reached their damage limit, they would lie on the ground for a time until they expired. Players could use a medic to revive them while downed.Some weapons, such as the Launcher, can kill players instantly, turning into skeletons and crumbling to dust. The Flamethrower is also capable of doing this. The Blaster can easily trap enemies in such a way as they can not escape between detonations, however this is not an un-revivable, instant death. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : In a time where class based game play was not popular, General Chaos employed a class system to give players more choices and more opportunities for planning out an effective attack.The classes are listed below with strengths and weaknesses. Weapon range is given in the game's ""Boot Camp"" section. </div> "

Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts,Sega R&D2,Sega,October 1989,genesis,The third game in the classic Ghosts 'n Goblins series sees the valiant knight Arthur once again embarking on a brutally difficult quest to rescue his beloved from demonic forces.,3030-7450,7450,0,1991-10-04,https://www.giantbomb.com/super-ghouls-n-ghosts/3030-7450/,CERO: A," <div> Overview : Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts is the third entry in Capcom's long-running Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. It is an action-platformer originally released in 1991 exclusively for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Like its predecessors, the game is famous for its high level of difficulty and features the heroic knight Sir Arthur on a brand-new quest to save his beloved Princess Guinevere from the clutches of the mighty demon-king Sardius (or Samael in the Japanese version). </div>  <div> Gameplay : The gameplay of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts is similar to that of run-and-gun side-scrolling action titles such as Contra, albeit with a larger focus on platforming. Arthur begins wearing his standard Steel Armor, which shatters after a single hit, leaving Arthur only in his underwear; a second hit ends his current life. In contrast to the previous game, Ghouls 'N Ghosts, Arthur can no longer fire his equipped weapon vertically up or down.New to this entry in the Ghosts 'N Goblins series is the ability to double-jump. Although Arthur still jumps in a fixed arc, he can now execute a second jump that allows him to gain extra height or even change his trajectory in mid-air. This gameplay mechanic adds an extra level of challenge to basic platforming beyond that of the series' previous games. </div>  <div> Stages : Arthur wearing Golden Armor in Stage 1Arthur begins the game with the straightforward Lance projectile weapon; several other weapons can be equipped throughout the game, each with their own unique properties. Acquiring the new Bronze Armor upgrade increases a weapon's damage, while the Golden Armor upgrade also allows Arthur to charge up for a magic attack that affects a larger area of the screen.Lance - Fires a single lance straight ahead. Upgrades to the Flaming Lance for additional damage. Thunder Magic fires a vertical magic bolt from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right for additional damage.Dagger - Fires a single dagger straight ahead. Weaker than the Lance, but can also be fired more quickly. Upgrades to the Magic Dagger that deals increased damage and leaves a damaging trail behind. Fire Dragon Magic creates a flaming dragon that sweeps around the screen in a counter-clockwise pattern.Axe - Fires a single Axe that slowly moves straight ahead in a looping pattern. Upgrades to the Hefty Axe which fires slightly upward before moving forward in a wave pattern for greater damage. Lightning Magic fires energy beams outward in eight directions.Crossbow - Fires twin bolts in an up-diagonal trajectory. Upgrades to the Magic Crossbow that fires three homing projectiles. Seek Magic reveals any chests hidden nearby.Torch - Lobs a single torch in a short forward arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Upgrades to the Magic Torch that increases the residual flames' size and damage. Fireball Magic creates three magic spheres that orbit around Arthur, causing damage on contact.Scythe - Fires a scythe straight ahead which can optionally be fired down-diagonally. Upgrades to the Magic Scythe for increased damage. Tornado Magic creates twin tornadoes that swirl around to Arthur's right and left sides.Tri-Blade - Fires a blade that travels in an ""L""-shaped pattern before returning to Arthur's position. Upgrades to the Shuriken for additional damage. Nuclear Magic creates an energy sphere that raises up from Arthur's position before splitting into two horizontal bolts travelling left and right.Goddess' Bracelet - Only available on the second playthrough, this special weapon can be obtained by opening certain chests while wearing the Golden Armor. It fires a large blast of energy straight ahead for a short distance, and its range increases with the Golden Armor equipped. However, the Bracelet cannot be charged for a magic attack.Arthur's Golden Armor comes equipped with the Moon Shield, which can deflect a single enemy projectile before shattering. While he has the Moon Shield equipped, Arthur may also discover the upgraded Sun Shield capable of deflecting up to three projectiles. Additionally, these two shields decrease the time required to execute a special charge attack, with the Sun Shield providing the fastest charge. </div> "

During each world, the player has to blast enemies with guns called GooShooters, that look similar to Super Soakers, except they shoot slimy projectiles. Each of these worlds consist of several sub-stages.The aim of each level is to collect a certain number of McDonald's Global Arches to advance to the next sub-stage. Also, during the game, the characters are guided by McDonalds mascot ""Ronald McDonald""s to recycle correctly. </div>  <div> Story : Players control either Mick or Mack over 12 levels in four worlds (Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-Town, and Arctic World).

The game was programmed by legendary developer David Perry, who would later go on to develop such games as Aladdin, Earthworm Jim, and Cool Spot, all of which would use the same engine as Global Gladiators. After the release of these games, David Perry's programming team would then go on to become Shiny Entertainment. </div>  <div> Advertisements and Messages : McDonald's famous ""Golden Arch"" logo.The game features abundant references to McDonald's brand restaurants, as well as a thorough environmentalist theme, given that players are fighting monsters made of pollution, going so far as to have a bonus stage in which players must collect falling garbage and throw it into the appropriate recycling bin (paper, plastic, or glass) whilst dodging falling anvils. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 6,8,8,8 adding, ""...An excellent action game with great graphics, excellent sounds, and solid game play. The animation is liquid smooth and the game play is as fast as Sonic in some areas. The graphics are highly detailed and the sounds feature voice and other digitized effects. Plenty of levels and hidden surprises!"".In the same issue Mike Weigand gave the Game Gear edition the score of 7, writing ""...huge levels and good control.

Playing badly will cause less enemies to appear and more bonuses to be awarded, while surviving for a long time might increase enemy aggression to compensate. Hercules can collect treasure and use it to buy useful power-up items from vendors accessible at the end of every area. Many enemies constantly respawn, so the player is recommended to move quickly through the maze-like stages, though some strategy is required due to the number of key puzzles to solve.Gods is scored by synth musician John Foxx, and the striking box art illustration (as seen on European versions of the game) was created by English comic book artist Simon Bisley. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,7,5,6 saying, ""...faithful to the original and even better as a SNES cart. The strategy aspect is a definite plus especially with the hidden rooms and intricate puzzles. The pseudo artificial intelligence for the skill level is cool and works quite well"". </div> "

The C button fires a powerful but slow blaster shot with a recoil that knocks the Granada back a small distance. </div> "

He jumps rapidly across the screen, destroying the ground that he and the mice fight on. Occasionally, he will hammer the wall and drop rocks from the ceiling, which will restore the broken ground. His hardhat prevents him from being jumped on, so he must be shot with the cowboy costume's popgun.The Dinosaur: If extinction couldn't beat this thing, surely two little mice can't. The dinosaur is awoken by Mickey and Minnie walking across its back, and it is not happy. It attacks by swinging its spiked tail, snorting its noxious breath and bringing its own spines to life. It is vulnerable to any attack, but only when it cranes its head into view.Arctic Weasel: This weasel takes cover in a mobile ice floe, which is outfitted with spikes on the exterior. On occasion, the water level in his arena will rise and fall, making him more difficult to hit. He is only vulnerable when he climbs out of the top of his floe and throws two icicles at Mickey and Minnie.Snowstorm: A living storm cloud that shoots out bouncing bolts of lightning and snowflakes that will freeze the mice. It is completely intangible and invulnerable to almost any attack. The only way that Mickey and Minnie are able to defeat it is by using their cleaner costumes to suck up the cloud. The more it is hit the smaller it becomes. However, if left alone long enough it will start to regrow.Baron Pete: The final boss. Fought in his lab, Pete attacks with evil magic spells that can shoot fire, electricity and summon minions. At first, he is invulnerable, until his helmet is broken by several shots from the cowboy costume's popgun. After taking enough damage, it seems that he has been defeated. Until it is revealed that he was simply casting another spell to begin the second phase of the fight. Can he be defeated in his monstrous form? </div> "

The game was released in North America on September 9th, 1993, and Japan on September 10th, 1993. Gunstar Heroes was the first game to be developed by  Treasure. The game was published by  Sega, so it was originally released for the Sega Genesis, but can currently also be found on Game Gear, PlayStation 2 (as a Sega Ages game), and Virtual Console. The sequel,  Gunstar Super Heroes, is on the Game Boy Advance.Gunstar Heroes was released as a part of the Sega Vintage Collection on the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on June 10, 2009 and June 11, 2009 respectively. It differed from the original version in a couple ways. First, it includes the ability to ""quick save"" one's game, as the game is being run off an emulator (all other Sega Vintage games have this capability as well). Second, sprites can now be smoothed. Online cooperative play has also been added, as well as the obvious achievements for the Xbox Live Marketplace release and trophies for the PlayStation Network release. </div>  <div> Story : The robot Golden Silver is used to suck dry a planet of all its resources. Professor White was able to defeat this robot in the past by removing its four gems and hiding it on one of planet Gunstar 9's moons. When the Empire found out about this, they sent Smash Daisaku to Gunstar 9. Here he brainwashed Gunstar Green and used him to find the four gems in order to resurrect Golden Silver and continue its resource sucking madness. Red and Blue set out to retrieve the gems and save their planet. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Similar to  Contra, the gameplay is 2D side scrolling run-and-gun shooter style and can be played in free form (the player can move while shooting) or fixed form (the player stops to shoot). The game also has melee combat, the player can slide, jump kick, and throw enemies. The weapon system uses four element types that the player can mix and match to yield different types of shots. These types are a lightning laser, flame thrower, homing missile, and a rapid machine gun. Gunstar Heroes is most famous for its boss encounters which have become a trademark of Treasure games. The bosses are usually the size of the entire screen and composed of several sprites against a scrolling background. The transforming  Seven Force boss is particularly memorable. </div>  <div> Characters : RedRed/Blue: The playable characters who set out to collect the mystical gems and save their planet.Yellow: Red and Blue's sister. She gives gives brief descriptions on the level select screen. Green: Red and Blue's brother and the pilot of the Seven Force. He has been brainwashed by the evil Empire to work for them.Professor White: Helps Red and Blue with equipment.Minion Soldiers: Countless identical robotic soldiers of low intelligence, these are barely a threat. Orange: The boss of the flying warship level. This roid rager focuses on hand to hand combat attacks and can use a blue flame. Pink: A bounty hunter in a giant mining machine that appears as the boss of the Ancient Ruins. Black: A gambling-obsessed lieutenant to Daisaku, Black built a dice maze fortress that requires Red and Blue to engage in a game of chance to reach him. Smash Daisaku: An  M. Bison lookalike, and the leader of the Empire. He brainwashed Green to help him retrieve the gems. He is fought several times throughout the game and uses bombs and a jetpack to attack Red/Blue. Golden Silver: The Ultimate Destroyer, Golden Silver is a robot powered by the gems that is used to suck planets dry of all their resources. His body is completely invulnerable, requiring Red and Blue to get creative. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Gunstar Heroes the review scores of 9,9,9, and 9 in addition to a ""Editor's Choice Platinum"" and Game of the Month awards.Martin Alessi wrote:This is one of the best looking carts I've seen from Sega in a while. The animation is slick as can be and the use of multiple sprites to form bosses is extremely well done... Definitely one of the most intense games I've seen on the home video game scene.

It was developed and published by Masaya exclusively for the Sega Mega Drive, with the localized versions published by Sega (Europe) and Dreamworks (North America).The game has a very distinct art style compared to other games in the genre opting for a more twisted, biological look instead of the standard spaceships and aliens, some of the enemies being huge bony creatures with extending necks and various other semi-mechanical creatures in the vein of H. R. Giger. There are six stages ranging from caves and Gothic church-like structures to completely mechanical and twisted tunnels seemingly inside the body of some creature. The game relies heavily on browns and greys in its colour palette to create its mood.The protagonist is an angel called Wor with feathered wings, his standard attack being a three-way spread shot. The three types of shot available to use include concentrated fire, a triangular fire and a dual shot able to fire both in front and behind.Wor fights a mid-level boss and an end of level boss at the end of each of the game's levels, There are no save points and players continued from the point they died if lives were remaining, and from the start of the stage if they lost all lives.  </div> "

The game was primarily published by Atari and released in February 1989. Ports for the Genesis, Lynx, NES and various PC systems were released in the following years. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The original arcade game features a full sit-down cabinet, complete with an early force feedback enabled steering wheel. Races include many A.I. opponents, which are spread around the track sparingly after the race start. Lap counts are typically two, consisting of many stunt obstacles such as loops and jumps, forcing the player to measure their speed at certain times to not overshoot a landing ramp, or lose momentum through a loop. If the player finishes in a top position, they are given an extra one-on-one race against the ""Phantom Photon"". </div>  <div> Presentation : The game was a substantial improvement in polygonal gaming, as most popular arcade racers of the time utilized animated 2D sprites rather than a 3D wire-frame environment. The player's vehicle strongly resembles a Ferrari Testarossa, which was a very popular sports car at the time of development. Traffic, A.I. opponents, and the fast-paced arcade music endemic to the late 1980s, are featured throughout Hard Drivin'.Hard Drivin' was the first arcade driving game to feature instant replay, which repeats the last several seconds of gameplay following a crash, in an elevated third-person perspective. The instant replay has its own specific musical accompaniment.    </div> "

In it, players take control of  Polterguy, a smart alec, undead teenager who has nothing better to do than to scare people.The object of the game is to scare the Sardini family by haunting different objects (which the game refers to as ""fright 'ems"") throughout their home. To haunt something Polterguy simply jumps into the object. Once an item is haunted it will cause an effect that will terrify anyone who is in the room. For example: if players haunt a bear rug, the bear head will start growling; haunt a pile of dishes and they'll go flying across the room. Each time a family member encounters one of these hauntings they will get more and more scared until they can't take it anymore and run out of the house. Once all of the family members are scared out of their home they will move to a new house where players must start the whole process over again.Being a ghost, Polterguy doesn't have health, he has  ecto. Ecto is a substance that Polterguy needs if he wants to stay in the real world and his supply of it is constantly depleting. After scaring a member of the family, they will drop a puddle of ecto that will help to restore the Polterguy's supply. The amount of ecto the player is barked at by the family dog, or if Polterguy is attacked by other, malevolent ghosts who appear in the later houses. These spirits appear to be in cahoots with the dog, who can summon them at will in the final house. If payers run out of ecto, they are sent to the Underworld.If sent to the Underworld, Polterguy must make his way through a grueling dungeon maze to collect ecto so that he may return to the living world. These dungeons are filled with enemies such as bats and skulls which can harm or even kill Polterguy.

For instance, red/purple fires directly ahead, yellow fires behind, green fires directly above and below, and blue fires in all four diagonal directions. This allowed players to target enemies in every direction, as long as they could switch modes quickly enough.

It was also a precursor to the hero shooter genre.",3030-11439,11439,0,1989-12-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/herzog-zwei/3030-11439/,," <div> Overview : Herzog Zwei (ヘルツォーク・ツヴァイ Herutsuōku Tsuvuai)  is a real-time strategy video game developed by Technosoft for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis home console. It was designed by Osamu Tsujikawa, and published in Japan by Technosoft in 1989 and in North America and Europe by Sega in early 1990.It is the sequel to Herzog, which was released only in Japan for the MSX and PC-88 personal computers in 1988. It was the second and last game in the Herzog series. It was later released again in 1991 in limited quantities.The game tasks the player with building a military force in what became to be typical Real Time Strategy fashion in an attempt to destroy the enemy base. The game could be played against the computer or against another human player via split-screen play, which while providing each player view of their enemy tactics, still kept the action moving at a fast pace. The game is often regarded as the first real-time strategy game, and was a major influence on Dune II.Herzog Zwei combined the fully real-time, fast-paced, arcade-style action gameplay of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a fairly easy-to-grasp level of strategy gameplay. It differed significantly from both turn-based strategy and real-time tactics, and is the earliest example of a game with a feature set that falls under the contemporary definition of modern real-time strategy.Along with a single-player mode against a computer opponent, it featured a split-screen two-player mode where both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken, forcing players to think quickly while on the move. Though the player only controls one unit, a transforming mech, the manner of control foreshadowed the point-and-click mechanic of later games. It introduced much of the genre conventions, including unit construction and resource management, with the control and destruction of bases being an important aspect of the game, as were the economic/production aspects of those bases.Upon release, the game received little mainstream recognition, and its novel approach to strategy gameplay polarized critics who were uncertain about what to make of it. It was generally well received by Japanese and European critics, with Computer and Video Games recognizing that its fully real-time, fast-paced gameplay set it apart from other strategy games at the time, while The Games Machine found its mixture of strategy and shoot 'em up elements to be unusual but refreshing. Reactions from North American critics, however, were generally negative, with Electronic Gaming Monthly criticizing it for being too complex, judging it as a flawed shooter rather than a novel strategy game, and giving it some of its lowest review scores for a Genesis game.Years after its release, the game eventually gained a cult following. It has since been considered one of the best two-player Mega Drive/Genesis games, and has been listed among the best games of all time, by Electronic Gaming Monthly, IGN and Next Generation. It has been credited with laying the foundations for the real-time strategy (RTS) genre, predating and influencing the genre-popularizing Dune II. It is also retrospectively considered a precursor to the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, which uses a similar formula of each player controlling a single command unit in one of two opposing sides on a battlefield. Herzog Zwei has been listed as one of the most important games ever made by 1UP, while GameSpy listed it as one of the most underrated games of all time.It was also a precursor to the hero shooter genre, as it was the first game to combine shooter and MOBA elements. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In a different approach than many modern RTS games, the player controlled a Bi-pedal walking Mech/Flying Jet hybrid that was used to build, order, transport and deploy all of the units. The player had to manage variables such as their available ammo, damage, and fuel (which depleted faster if the player was carrying a unit) all the while commanding an army of tanks, surface to air missile launchers, infantry units, as well as support vehicles and boats on certain missions. To make things even more complicated, the player's Mech could be destroyed by enemy units (SAM launchers being notoriously deadly) or by the other enemy Mech itself. If the player were to be caught carrying any cargo when it was destroyed, the cargo would be lost, and the player would be transported back to their home base. Thankfully being sent back to base was a quick process that shortened any down time to a minimum.Multiplayer Mayhem!!!Each unit cost a certain amount of resources, which would automatically be replenished overtime. If the player needed more resources, they could always capture one of the many sub-basses scattered across the map. These sub-bases were important, as capturing one not only providing the previously mentioned bonus funds, also provided a new place to pick up and deploy units, as well as a place to re-fuel and re-arm the player's Mech. Of course there were risks to expanding, as it not only spread the player's units thin (a unit number cap of 50 units was set for both players), but the sub-bases could also be captured by the enemy, which meant defenses needed to be set to keep the enemy at bay. Of course those defenses took away from the total available units, which placed a greater emphasis on good and effective strategy and less on steamrolling the enemy with accumulating a massive military. </div>  <div> Reception : The unit types within the game are as follows: Infantry, Motorbike, Supply Truck, Armored Car, Tank, S.A.M., Gatling Gun, and Boat.Infantry:Unit Cost: $500The infantry unit is pretty weak in terms of offensive power, but it also serves an important purpose. The infantry unit is the only unit that can capture expansion bases, which provide extra deployment points. Infantry units also require no supplies.Motorbike:Unit Cost: $950A very quick unit that specializes in movement over power and armor. Relatively cheap, but the downside is that the armor and weapon power is relatively weak. A good harassment tool.Supply Truck:Unit Cost: $1,500A unit with no defenses of its own, the supply truck is the games basic support unit. It automatically seeks out units with low supplies and replenishes them. An additional way to help units in addition to doing it manually.Armored Car:Unit Cost: $1,300The basic light attack unit of the game, the key strength of the armored car is the high amount ammunition it carries, even though it sacrifices that for overall power. At about half the cost of the tank, it makes a great unit for a quick strike.Tank:Unit Cost: $3,200The backbone of any Herzog Zwei military attacking force, an army of tanks is a scary sight for any base defenses. High armor and high weapon power, the downside comes from mobility and cost.S.A.M.:Unit Cost: $4,300Surface to Air Missile launchers (S.A.M.) are a great way to keep enemy Jets at bay. The missiles are very powerful, often killing an opponent in a few hits. A good expansion base defense. However, they have no ground attacks what-so-ever.Boat:Unit Cost: $3,400Only available on maps with water, the boat is often overlooked as a great way to attack an enemy's main base. it has a lot of supplies, and decent attack power. Plus they can only be attacked by nearby land. The boat is limited by the amount of area it can attack from.Gatling Gun:Unit Cost: $15,000The most costly unit in the entire game, the gatling gun is the best main base defense unit an army can have. Not only is the primary ground fire very effective, but it also has missiles much like the S.A.M. (though they travel slower than the S.A.M.'s missiles). The cost may be prohibitive, but the trade-off is worth it, just make sure they aren't destroyed. </div>  <div> Legacy : Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameRankings71.3%[23](2 reviews)Sega Retro79%[12](19 reviews)Review scoresPublicationScoreAllGame[24]Computer and Video Games82%[9]Electronic Gaming Monthly17 / 40Famitsu29 / 40[11]InsomniaJoystick78%[27]Mega Drive Advanced Gaming85%[28]Play Time85%[29]Power Play80%[30]Raze80%[31]Sega-1610 / 10[7]Sega Power80%[32]Sega Pro80%[33]The Games Machine75%[3]AwardsPublicationAwardElectronic Gaming Monthly,[14][15] IGN,[16][17] Next Generation[13]Best Games of All Time1UPMost Important Games Ever Made[8]GameSpyMost Underrated Games of All Time[21]Upon release, Herzog Zwei was not very commercially successful and received little mainstream recognition, due to its lack of marketing, relatively early release on the Mega Drive/Genesis platform, and non-arcade genre on what was considered an arcade-oriented game console. Upon its 1990 release in North America, Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) harshly criticized the game for being too complex and judged it as a flawed shooter rather than a novel strategy game. They gave it an average rating of 4.25 out of 10, or 17 out of 40 overall, based on a panel of four individual reviewers giving it scores of 4, 6, 4, and 3 out of 10 (see Electronic Gaming Monthly, 1993 Video Game Buyer's Guide, page 46). The game received some of the lowest scores the magazine had ever handed out to a Genesis game; 3 out of 10 was the lowest score any Genesis game had received from EGM reviewers up until 1993, and Herzog Zwei was one of only six Genesis games to have received this score up until then (see Electronic Gaming Monthly, 1993 Video Game Buyer's Guide, page 46). In Japan, the game was generally well received by Famitsu, which gave it a score of 29 out of 40. ''Famitsu'' compared it to Nectaris and Famicom Wars, but noted that Herzog Zwei distinguished itself with its simultaneous, two-player, real-time gameplay.The game was generally more well received by European critics. In the United Kingdom, Warren Lapworth reviewed the game in the March 1990 issue of The Games Machine magazine, giving the game a 75% score. He criticized the title as ""one of the silliest"" names he had seen for a video game, but described the game itself as an ""unusual product,"" a console strategy game with shoot 'em up style gameplay, stating, ""Whether it's intended to get strategists to consider buying the console or to broaden the horizons of trigger-happy lunatics, I don't know. Either way, it's quite refreshing and can be quite addictive in two-player mode, fierce rivalry developing between friends."" In the April 1990 issue of Computer and Video Games, reviewer Paul Glancey gave the game an 82% score. He described it as ""a game of conquest between two commanders in real time"" and recognized that what ""sets it apart from other strategy games is that everything happens in real time. Both players are in action simultaneously and there are no pauses while decisions are taken so you have to think on the move or die."" He noted that the command icons are ""fairly easy to grasp"" and concluded that it is a game that helps establish the Mega Drive as a ""real"" computer rather than ""just a machine for immobilised arcade players."" Its highest rating from a British magazine was from Mega Drive Advanced Gaming, which gave it an 85% score. In France, the game was reviewed in the November 1990 issue of the Joystick magazine, where reviewer JM Destroy gave the game a 78% score. The game was particularly well received in Germany, where critics referred to it as simply Herzog 2, with Power Play magazine giving it an 80% score in its April 1990 issue, while Play Time gave it an 85% score in its June 1991 issue.Long after its release, the game gained a cult following and achieved some popularity. David Filip of Allgame gave the game a score of 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as ""one of the first"" and ""one of the best"" strategy video games on home consoles and as ""a fine cure for those days when you want a different kind of RTS to control."" Daniel Thomas of Sega-16 gave it a score of 10 out of 10 in 2004, describing it as ""very probably the finest videogame you've never played"" and as the Genesis console's ""finest hour."" Lawrence Wright of Insomnia gave the game a score of 5 out of 5 stars in 2008. GameSpot users have given Herzog Zwei an average score of 8.8 out of 10, as of 2009 and 2015.It is often found on several ""best games of all time"" lists, owing to its precedence in the real-time strategy genre, as well to the increasing understanding of finer points of its mechanics. It was featured in the ""Top 100 Games Ever"" list of Electronic Gaming Monthly, in the November 1997 issue which ranked it at #43 (by a different editorial line-up from years earlier), and in the January 2002 issue which ranked it #52. The February 1999 issue of Next Generation ranked it at #39 in its list of 50 best games of all time.

The gameplay systems involved allow players to pass the puck to other members on their team and for the opposing team to intercept the puck by skating and breaking the straight line of passage between both of the passing team players.The game gets more arcade like with the super shots. A player if left alone and unobstructed for long enough can charge up the shot causing their player to backflip and shoot the puck past the goalie or into the goalie knocking them into the net for the goal. The next super shot is is a windmill which which is performed when one player is skating behind the net and hitting the pass button when the player in front of the net's stick begins to glow. If done correctly the puck will be flipped over the net and the player in front will spin and bat the puck into the net.Since the game is basically a hockey version of  Arch Rivals there are no rules. Players have special moves including: elbows, headbutts, slashing, and a swift kick to the groin, all of which are illegal in the sport of hockey. Along with with no penalties comes fighting and lots of it; though it occurs at random the players will fight, and when in a fight the player can dodge by holding away from the opposing player, punch and also uppercut, the loser of the brawl falling to the ice with birds flying over their head. Winning a fight comes with a few advantages, the player involved in the scuff will receive and speed boost and the chance to grab some tainted although very powerful water from the bench resulting in a zero time charge for a Super Shot, while the loser will stay sluggish in control for sometime after the fight, and if a player loses too many fights in one period they are removed with an injury. </div>  <div> The Roster : Hit the Ice is in no way connected the the NHL so therefore does not contain any NHL players.""Dicky"" Fontaine""Gunner"" Hall (spoof of Glen Hall)Pierre BourdoirPhil Bonker (spoof of Phil Esposito)""Battleship"" BoydDavid VolekIven Yakashev spoof of a Soviet player from 1972Willy Lindberg Tom Horyna (spoof of Tim Horton)Al GiglianoHappy Goleck (""happy-go-lucky"")Wayne Greatman (spoof of Wayne Gretzky)Reggy MarshJonny NovakPetter Kidd, *""Bo"" ClevelandBob DoverMike Barr </div> "

Originally released in limited quantities, it was later re-published by Accolade in 1990 (along with first-party ports for Amiga computers and MS-DOS PCs).In Ishido, players are given an empty 96-tile (12×8) board and must place a series of tiles (or ""stones"") one-by-one in an attempt to have all 72 stones on the board, where each stone can only be placed based on the color and/or symbol of adjacent stones. Designed by Michael Feinberg, the game is notable for including graphical contributions by Brodie Lockard (the designer of the 1986 game Shanghai).Similar to Shanghai and its derivatives, the game is heavily themed around the Ancient Orient. Themed on mysticism, one of its features is the ""Oracle"", which prompts players to pose a question to meditate on while playing and then receive an answer from the game, based on the ancient Chinese text I Ching, when a difficult ""4-Way Match"" is made. Its original limited-edition release was packaged in a hand-made Japanese-style walnut slip box.Along with ports released by Accolade, the game received ports in 1990 and 1991 for the Game Boy (released by NEXOFT in North America and by ASCII in Japan), for the Atari Lynx (released by Atari in North America), for the Family Computer Disk System (released by Hiro in Japan only via Disk Writer kiosks), and for numerous Japanese computers (with an ASCII release for the NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, and Sharp X68000 computers and a Fujitsu release for the FM Towns). The Macintosh version was re-published by MacPlay in 1995. It also received multiple clones after its original release, most notably the game Stones (included in the second installment of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack).Accolade also released a Sega Genesis port in 1990, which is known for being the first unlicensed game for the system in North America. As it doesn't use documented code later used on the TradeMark Security System (or TMSS) feature in later system models, the game is only supported in early models of the original Sega Genesis.The DOS and Mac versions of the game were later released for free on the website of Ian Gilman, the game's programmer. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Ishido, players are given an empty 96-stone (12×8) board and a ""pouch"" of 72 stones (two of each of the 36 types of stones, where each type is a combination of one of six colors and one of six symbols). Six stones are automatically placed on the board (where each color and each symbol are present), and players must use those to place additional stones from the pouch in an attempt to empty the pouch.Each stone order from the pouch is randomized (and can be peeked, although this will nullify the score) and players can only place stones adjacent to another under a certain criteria:Spaces where only one stone is adjacent (a ""1-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching the adjacent stone's color or symbol.Spaces where two stones are adjacent (a ""2-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching one adjacent stone's color and the other adjacent stone's symbol.Spaces where three stones are adjacent (a ""3-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching either two adjacent stones of the same color and one other adjacent stone of the same symbol or one adjacent stone of the same color and two other adjacent stones of the same symbol.Spaces where all four stones are adjacent (a ""4-Way Match"") can only be filled by those matching two adjacent stones of the same color and two other adjacent stones of the same symbol. This is difficult to achieve and grants a higher score bonus.When either the pouch is empty or the current drawn stone cannot be placed anywhere on the board, the game ends and players are scored. </div>  <div> Themes : The game includes four play modes:Solitaire - Standard one-player mode.Cooperative - Same as Solitaire, but players can choose to have a second computer-controlled player aid them by alternating turns with them.Tournament - Same as Solitaire, but each playthrough uses the same stone draw order.

Players can drive both forward and backwards, with the ability to control the speed and direction of the motorcycle, even whilst in midair. Players can also perform a small hop to jump over obstacles or off of ramps and springs to gain extra height.Using the height gained from ramps, springs and other obstacles players are able to perform a variety of stunts before touching the ground. Stunts can be strung together into a combo either by preforming several stunts in the air at once or by performing a wheelie or endo after touching the ground. Performing stunts earns the players a score for the level but also fills a boost meter which can be used to provide a temporary speed boost. More points are awarded for stunts which take longer to complete, for holding the stunt for as long as possible without crashing and for performing as many stunts as possible within in a single combo (with each stunt adding to the score multiplier).The levels in Joe Danger consist of three parallel lanes, each with a variety of obstacles, which can either help or hinder progress through the course. Ramps, springs, fans and boost pads all help by giving either more height or speed, whereas spikes, shark tanks, mouse traps and a horizontal bar all serve to make the ride more perilous by causing the player to dismount their bike and reset at the last checkpoint. Lanes can only be changed at lane change switches which are set points within some of the levels and force the player to switch into a new lane.Collect all the coins!Each level has one main objective and at least one secondary objective. The main objective is tied to the rating for the level (gold, silver or bronze) with the most common main objective being earn a high score over a specified amount. Other main objectives include landing on targets placed around the course (simply driving over them doesn't count), collecting as many coins within a certain time limit, knocking over bowling pins with the player 'ragdolling' after crashing through the air or competing in a race with other drivers.The secondary objectives for each level award the player with stars which are used to unlock additional levels. Secondary objectives range from may include some of the aforementioned main objectives if they are not the primary objective for the stage as well as other goals such as collecting blue mini-stars, completing the level within a set time limit, completing a level or objective while maintaining a combo throughout the entire level, collecting the letters D-A-N-G-E-R and lastly finding stars hidden within the particular course.Some levels within the game also have an optional pro medal to be earned which requires the player to complete all of the stage's main and secondary objectives within one complete run of the stage.

Mainly, Dennis Nedry's Barbasol can of dinosaur embryos, which serves as the opening plot point for the main characters to meet. The timeline of the game occurs both within the film and in the aftermath of the incident, and the player experiences these moments in part from the viewpoint of Jurassic Park's chief veterinarian, Gerry Harding. Other characters include Harding's daughter Jess and other inhabitants of Isla Nublar not seen in the movie, such as scientists, smugglers, or mercenaries. Like recent releases from Telltale Games, Jurassic Park: The Game is broken up into a series of four episodes. However, all four episodes ship with the game, with one easily transitioning to the next without having to purchase the next episode piecemeal. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Telltale Games has said to have been heavily influenced by Heavy Rain's mechanics. The game includes slow-paced investigation sequences where the player pans the camera and initiates sequences where the main character takes closer looks at key places. This is often accompanied with dialogue choices, moving between key locations within the puzzle area, and minor button-mashing sequences. It will also shift to immediate response Quick Time Events when a life or death situation presents itself, such as directional input either solo or in sequences, and also faster button-mashing sequences. If the player is not quick enough to complete the button prompts on the screen, they will either be rewarded with another chance to get the sequence right or with a delightful character death sequence, such as being crushed between the horns of a Triceratops or the jaws of a Tyrannosaurus. Not even young Jess is spared from meeting a demise.There are many cases where a failed Quick Time Event won't immediately render a death screen though. Some will only drain the end Award level for each survival sequence.Gold - Complete all QTEs in the sequence.Silver - Miss one QTE in the sequence.Bronze - Missed three QTEs in the sequence.No Award - Missed five QTEs prompts in the sequence.If the player fails a QTE that results in death, the game will reload to a designated checkpoint where the sequence started, this will cause players to lose one award point. </div>  <div> Story : The story of Jurassic Park: The Game is comprised of four episodes, each being 11 to 12 scenarios long. Each scenario takes place in a different location of the park. Some locations will be familiar to fans of the first Jurassic Park film, such as the Dennis Nedry car scene or the Park's Visitor Center, while other locations will be brand new to both new players and old fans. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The episode opens with Nima Cruz stumbling through the jungle, injured, clutching the Barbasol can and growing more and more delirious. Hired by BioSyn, she's been searching for Dennis Nedry and the can, unaware of the content or even about the kind of animals roaming the park. After surviving an onslaught of Dilophosauruses, she's then been attacked by a different kind of poisonous dinosaur called Troodon and there's a pack of them stalking her as she grows weaker with every step. This is where she's almost run over by a jeep driven by Gerry Harding, on his way back to the visitor's center with his teenage daughter Jess. Unaware of her reasons to be on the island, Gerry lifts her into the car and tries to stabilize her so she can receive treatment. When they make it back to the visitor's center, they enter it just in time to miss the sight of the helicopter carrying off the survivors from the motion picture.With the T-rex still being around, they fight their way to save Nima and survive themselves. Though the situation naturally only gets worse as Nima's desperation to get the can to the North Harbor becomes more apparent. Only minutes after regaining consciousness, she draws a gun on the father and daughter. </div> "
Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition,BlueSky Software,Sega,October 1994,genesis,"Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition is the sequel to the original Jurassic Park for the Sega Genesis.

The game was soon approved for development with most of the original team intact, though with a significantly shorter schedule of about six to eight months. A programmer from the first game, Jason Weesner, wrote the original design document for the game.For Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition, a completely new game engine was built to handle the new environments. Though much of the art from the original Jurassic Park was recycled for use. Though many sprites were noticeably touched up, with most characters receiving a defined black outline. Similarly the original game, you could still opt to trade in your guns for claws and play as the velociraptor. </div>  <div> Differences : Rampage Edition differed from its predecessor in several ways. In the first Jurassic Park the developers were given specific instructions to not allow the player to kill dinosaurs for fear that it would frighten children playing the game. However for Rampage Edition the player's arsenal was extended to include armament such as flamethrowers, machine guns, and a plasma weapon that reduced enemies to skeletons before turning them to dust. Because of this more apparent violence the game was given the now-defunct rating of MA-13.In the original game the player progressed through levels in a strictly linear fashion. For the sequel the level progression became much more non-linear, allowing you to select one of three stages when you begin. Completing these stages in any order opened access to more. </div>  <div> Level Design : The game gave you six levels to play if you select to play as Grant and a total of five levels if you play as the velociraptor. Depending on which character you chose meant each level would play out different and in a slightly different order. </div>  <div> Ending : Grant works his way back to the ground.Selecting Grant starts you in the grip of a flying pteranodon which drops you in its nest, but not before exposing you to attacks from soldiers and other dinosaurs. Your goal is then to work your way from the tree tops back down to the bottom of the stage. As you make your way down you must avoid fire from enemy soldiers as well as dinosaur attacks. In addition to this, occasionally a pteranodon latch on to you, taking you back to the top of the level. On the other side, when playing as the velociraptor you must work your way from the bottom of the stage up to the top, and then down once more. </div> "

Most of the fighting mechanics in the game resemble those in professional wrestling games (including a grappling system and the use of pinfalls to win). Similar to beat-'em-ups, defeated players can re-join the match by continuing, restoring their stamina while not restoring the enemy's.Unlike most fighting games, a second player cannot interrupt a single-player game for a versus match. Instead, joining in immediately turns the game into a two-on-two co-operative mode.

It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 and the Sega Genesis in 1993, both by TAKARA. Unlike most Neo Geo games of the era, this game did not receive a port to the Neo Geo CD.The game would eventually be followed up with a sequel, titled King of the Monsters 2: The Next Thing, which adds more elements from beat-'em-ups.

The goal is to guide all Vikings safely through each level. The game's originality is due to the fact that the player controls three different characters (although only one at any given time), and must make use of their individual abilities and their combination to solve puzzles and progress. The game featured infinite opportunities of retries in case the player were to lose one of the Vikings. Much of the game's appeal came from the humorous inter-level dialogues of the characters. </div>  <div> Characters : The three vikingsThis game sets players with the task of completing each level by using 3 different characters. This requires the use of each Viking's abilities as well as getting them all to the area's exit point alive.Erik the Swift - As his name states, he is very agile being the only one of the three that can run or jump. That fact alone makes him invaluable in a platformer but, additionally, if he gets a large enough start he can do a speeding charge helmet first into things. It will damage enemies but it's main use is in destroying breakable walls.Baleog the Fierce - He lives up to the name by being the main fighter. He has a sword to strike down enemies and a longbow to kill from afar. His bow serves the dual purpose of being able to activate buttons from a distance. In certain stages, Baelog is able to set his arrows on fire to solve various puzzles.Olaf the Stout - He carries on him a large round shield as tall as himself which lets him stop almost any attack. This can halt approaching enemies, or protect the vikings from any oncoming projectiles. His shield can also be lifted above his head. Not only will this work as a platform allowing Erik a higher jump from, but it manages to serve as a hang glider for Olaf, allowing his stout frame to float through the air. </div>  <div> Areas : The game consists of 36 stages, divided into several chapters, each with a different theme.Stages 1-4: The vikings attempt to escape from the alien shipStages 5-11: The vikings are in prehistoric Earth, fighting dinosaurs and cave-menStages 12-17: The vikings are in ancient Egypt, and now have to contend enemies which are able to leap over Olaf's shield, as well as poisonous insects.Stages 18-25: The vikings are in a modern factory, and must navigate more automated environmental hazards.Stages 26-33: The vikings are in ""Wonderland"", and area that operates off of cartoon physics.Stages 34-36: The vikings are back on the alien ship and must now fight Tomator, the leader of the aliens. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,8,8,8, adding, ""Another excellent job from Interplay! Once you play, you're greeted with excellent soundtracks and plenty of bass! The puzzles get very difficult but are not frustrating. The Viking characters have their own personalities complete with comical antics. This game is a definite must-get"". </div>  <div> References in other Blizzard games : The Hyperion's bar in Starcraft II has an arcade machine named ""The Lost Viking"". It's a shoot'em up where players take control of a lost spaceship (named 'Viking' after the SC2 Terran unit) trying to get home.The Lost Vikings are playable as all three characters at once in Blizzard's MOBA  game Heroes of the Storm.

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first ""killer apps"" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked ""GOAL""). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no ""lives remaining"" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black ""enemy"" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time. </div> "

Tyrants: Fight Through Time,Sensible Software,Virgin Interactive,March 1993,genesis,Tyrants: Fight Through Time is a god simulator from Sensible Software in which the player brings the force of their civilization to bear against their rivals in a struggle for dominance. In Europe and Japan it is better known as Mega-lo-Mania.,3030-6450,6450,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/tyrants-fight-through-time/3030-6450/,," <div> Overview : Mega-lo-Mania is a god sim from Sensible Software, a UK company better known for Cannon Fodder and Sensible Soccer. It plays like a speedier version of Civilization, where the race to invent and craft technology and conquer enemies plays out in quick, real-time campaigns across various islands. As the game progresses, the technology tree gets more and more futuristic.Mega-lo-Mania was originally released on the Commodore Amiga in 1991 and ported to various other European computers like the Atari ST and PC. A Genesis port was created by Sensible Software which was also released in Japan and the US, and was renamed Tyrants: Fight Through Time for the latter region.There is also a Sharp X68000 conversion created by Japanese developer SPS and published in Japan as MegaLoMania: Jikuu Daisenryaku (""MegaLoMania: Great Space/Time Strategy""). The SNES version is based on this game, and was also released in Europe. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Players choose one of four factions represented by a color and a divine avatar. Scarlet is red; Oberon is yellow; Madcap is blue; and Caesar is green (some versions switch these colors). The game is scenario-based, with a trio of islands that players must conquer for each Epoch. Islands are divided into between 2 and ~16 square sectors that each can be controlled by a single player and houses a tower. The aim of each each scenario is to use the resources available to take control of the island by destroying the other factions. To begin a scenario the player allocates the number of starting people to take from the limited man-pool available and choose a starting sector. After winning 3 islands they are given additional people and any not used are carried over; staying in the pool.The two main resources that must be managed are man-power and minerals. Man-power can be allocated to mining minerals, researching weapons, manufacturing higher-tier weapons, attacking enemy towers/armies with said weapons and constructing new towers in vacant sectors. Any people not allocated a job will reproduce at exponential speed -- that is, the more people that are unoccupied in a tower the faster they reproduce; a large idle population (say, 200) might produce a person every second or so while a single person will take several minutes to reproduce (it's probably best not to ask how a single person manages to reproduce at all). Each manufacturing or research job will take a number of man-hours to complete, so doubling the number of people working on it will halve the time taken. Each tower/sector is independent and must research its own techs and mine its own minerals, only people can move between sectors and each sector has its own limited selection of minerals to mine. Each weapon requires minerals but has many different possible mineral recipes with the most efficient recipe possible using the tower's mineral stocks at the time the research completes. Which weapons can be researched at a tower is limited by the available minerals and maximum (and minimum) technology level (or epoch) of the island. As the player progresses from island to island later epochs become available. Attacking an enemy sector (or claiming a vacant sector) involves choosing how many people the player wants to form their army, what they want them to be armed with and choosing the target sector. They will instantly appear in the target sector and fight any non-allied units -- the player cannot further direct the battle except to order a retreat. </div> "

It features six mini-games in total, as the name suggests, with a few variables the player can set beforehand (such as limited auto-aim).These mini-games include:Pest Control: a top-down shooter where the player has to protect a delicious floor pizza from hungry cockroaches. The player's reticle also acts as a light source, rendering the rest of the field dark and the bug movements unknown until they enter the crosshairs. The goal is to exterminate all the bugs before the pizza is completely devoured.Space Station Defender: alien pods teleport into the field shortly before opening to reveal gunmen within, and the player must remember the order they appeared and shoot them all after they open but before they can hit the player.Ready, Aim, Tomatoes!: featuring Earl from ToeJam & Earl, the player's goal is to hit humans and other Earth creatures with tomatoes as the screen scrolls along. A score milestone is required to pass the stage, which the player earns from defeating enemies and maintaining a high accuracy percentage.Whack Ball: as an air hockey paddle, the player must maneuver a puck around to hit all the bricks on the screen in a manner similar to Breakout. Later stages have gaps in the outer wall that the puck can escape through, which costs the player a life.Front Line: the player must take out as many military vehicles as possible as they cross the screen. While vehicles will be destroyed by sustained machine gun fire, the player can also use missiles to instantly eliminate a vehicle though they have a limited number of the latter. Rockman's Zone: this mini-game has the player walking through the level taking down enemies as soon as they appear. The game also has non-hostile pop-ups that the player must not shoot. </div> "

Moonwalker features Michael saving children, turning into a robot, his pet monkey Bubbles, and magical dance fighting. Later released in arcades on the Mega-Tech hardware.",3030-21182,21182,0,1990-08-24,https://www.giantbomb.com/michael-jacksons-moonwalker/3030-21182/,," <div> Overview : Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a  side-scroller released for the Sega Master System and Sega Genesis, loosely based on the film of the same name. An arcade release running on the Mega-Tech (Mega Drive-based) hardware was later released and despite the identical name, was an entirely different game from the System 18-based  Michael Jackson's Moonwalker arcade game that had been released beforehand.Moonwalker puts players in the shoes of  Michael Jackson, tasked to rescue children who had been kidnapped by  Mr. Big and his army of mobsters, vicious dobermans, and  zombies. To rescue the kids, Michael takes on the army of criminals with his dancing repertoire and theatrical magic.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Hitting the attack button causes Michael to send out a fly kick, or throw up his arms in an exaggerated dance fashion. Each of these attacks sends out a burst of magic sparks that extend the range of the strike. Enemies struck by the magic will violently ricochet off the screen before collapsing (akin to the way enemies would go flying in  Battletoads ).Michael could also use two special attacks to defeat enemies when overwhelmed. Lightly pressing the special attack button would cause Michael to throw out his hat, which would cause enemies to  explode. However, holding the special attack button would cause all the enemies on screen to line up with Michael and dance to 16-bit renditions of Michael Jackson's most famous hits of the time, such as ""Smooth Criminal"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller."" These dances, once completed, would cause all enemies onscreen to collapse.Once Michael has located all the children in the level, Bubbles, Michael's pet monkey, would fly onscreen, sit on the Michael's shoulder, and point vaguely in the general direction of the level's  boss encounter.On some levels, Michael can catch a magical star, transforming him into a  robot, rendering him invincible and capable of firing lasers and missiles to show the enemy no mercy.In the game's options menu it is possible to listen to all of Michael's songs featured in the game.  </div> "
Mickey Mania,Traveller's Tales,Sony ImagesoftNA/PALSegaJP,November 1994,genesis,A side-scrolling platformer featuring Disney mascot Mickey Mouse that is inspired by his long history in animated films.,3030-16875,16875,0,1994-10-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/mickey-mania/3030-16875/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse (known in Europe as Mickey Mania) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Traveller's Tales (in conjunction with Psygnosis) and published by Sony Imagesoft for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on October 1994 and for the Genesis and Sega CD on November 1994. The Japanese version was only released for the SNES (by Capcom) and Genesis (by Sega).Originally developed to celebrate the 65th birthday of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse, the game has the titular mouse adventuring through some of his various short films (from the 1928 Steamboat Willie to the 1990 The Prince and the Pauper) as he must find his past selves, rescue his dog Pluto, and defeat Pete.Made in collaboration with Disney, the game is one of the few games to feature digitized animations from Disney-affiliated animation studios (from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida division in collaboration with Creative Capers Entertainment).Each subsequent version of the game includes new sequences and minor additions. For example, both the Sega console versions add a new hidden bonus sequence (based on the 1935 short film The Band Concert) and a ""spiral staircase"" sequence in the second level. The Sega CD version features both redbook audio and digitized voice samples of Mickey, as well as an extra sequence before the final boss.The game was later ported on March 1996 to the PlayStation in Europe (as Mickey's Wild Adventure), featuring enhanced graphics and graphical effects and a new ""chase"" sequence in the fifth level (where Mickey is pursued by Willie the Giant). This version was later digitally re-released via PlayStation Network on December 13, 2011 (in Europe) for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation Vita. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mickey Mania is fairly typical of the side-scrolling platform genre. Players guide Mickey from left to right through levels, passing obstacles through  jumping or  solving puzzles. Enemies can be defeated either by jumping on them or by  throwing marbles at them. The game is famously difficult: a lot of this difficulty is because some of the game requires a lot of precise timing and many of the enemies are hard to defeat without taking damage.At the top left hand corner of the screen is Mickey's Glove. The number under the glove symbolizes the number of lives the player has remaining and the fingers of the glove show how many hits Mickey can take before losing a life. </div>  <div> Items : In Mickey Mania there are three types of items at Mickey's disposal, each with a different purpose:Stars: These give you 1 health (finger) back per star. If Mickey has full health and gets the stars, they will disappear and he will NOT get an extra life.Marbles: The main tool for getting through most levels in this game. Marbles are everywhere to collect and the serve as a means of hitting enemies and bosses. They are transferable from level to level though Mickey has a holding limit of 99 marbles.Mouse Ears: Mickey's Mouse Ears can come in very handy and are in secretive locations throughout the game. They replenish one full life, regardless if you have not previously lost a life. </div>  <div> Cartoons Featured as Levels : There are a total of 7 levels to play through in Mickey Mania. </div> "

Developed and published by Data East for the arcades in 1989 its gameplay is very reminiscent of the Contra / Probotector saga released by Konami.In Europe the game was ported by Special FX to several 8-bit and 16-bit home computers and published in 1990 by Ocean Software. The Genesis conversion was done in 1991 by ISCO / Opera House and given a new soundtrack composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto.It is notable in its original arcade format for having a rotatable hat as part of the joystick. The joystick 'hat's rotation would then relate to the direction the player's character aimed their weapon in the game. This was an innovative approach to solving a re-occuring problem in platform shoot 'em-ups, of aiming in a different direction to the movement of the player's character. The arcade version also supports a two players co-op mode which was omitted in all other portings except on the Amiga. </div>  <div> Story : There are different story versions depending on the platform the game was released on:Time to free the family (Genesis)In the Arcade version, two nameless brothers are on a mission to rescue their family from an alien mutant known as King Crimson.In the home computer versions published by Ocean Software, a ruthless Commissar, leader of a vicious regime of megalomaniacs, has kidnapped the players family (including the grandfather - a world famous scientist in the field of weapons research). Now it is the task of the player to free his relatives before the evil Commissar forces the grandfather to reveal his superior weapons research which he can then use to subjugate the world.In the Genesis version, the player assumes the role of Johnny Ford (Daichi Madoka in the Japanese version) a member of an operative group who shuts down drug cartels. Johnny's father, Dr. Malcom Ford, is also a fighter against drug abuse and is about to research a serum that would break people's addiction to lethal drugs. He has tested it on laboratory rats, and is in the process of making it safe for use by human beings. When Crimson King, the head of the most powerfull drug cartel, finds out about the research he loses no time and immediately kidnaps the whole family. After completing his last mission, Johnny returns home only to find an devastated house. When he sees a note in which King Crimson kidnapped his entire family he immediately starts for the tropical island called Matano. Since Johnny knows the Crimson King's organization inside and out, he suspects this to be the place where his family is being held. </div>  <div> Gameplay : With a character, that resembles Rambo and is armed with an automatic weapon, nine rather short levels have to be crossed before the final showdown with King Crimson. The play mechanics and controls are similar to that of the Contra series and the Arcade and Amiga versions can be played by two players in a co-op mode. The main protagonist can run in two directions, jump, crawl, climb ladders and shoot in eight directions(clockwise or counter-clockwise).The Arcade game has as already mentioned a special rotating joystick similar to the one used in Ikari Warriors for independent control of movement and firing. This property has been cumbersome ported to the other systems that lack this joystick. In the home computer versions for example, pressing and holding the fire button will maintain the last movement (standing, walking, crawling) and after that the joystick lever can be used to determine the direction of the shot. In the Genesis version two control schemes are offered: The first one is a basic method of shooting the direction of the D-pad while the second one, which is considerably trickier to control and requires more practice, allows the player to continually shoot in a particular direction no matter what the D-pad is doing.Weapon storage room (C64)On the way, the player must fight enemies such as soldiers, tanks, jets, saws, helicopters, ships and metal snakes. Some of the defeated soldiers lose red keys that can be picked up and used to buy weapons at the end of each level where the player enters a weapon storage room. There are six glass cases with a different number of key slots at the bottom, each holding one weapon or item. The number of the key slots shows how many keys are required to open the case and release the weapon or item included in it. Since each player can carry only six keys at the same time he will never be able to open every case and should therefore experiment early with each different type of weapon and find out which ones are more effective.The two types of weapons that can be purchased in the weaponry are hand-held weapons(Full Auto, 3-Way, Fire, Shot Gun) and backpack weapons(Nitro, Shower, Homing Missile) that are launched by pushing the joystick up while pressing the shoot button or simply with the space key in the home computer versions. All types of weapons have limited ammunition and when the player runs out of ammo, he will revert to the default ""Full Auto"" rifle which is the only one with unlimited ammo. Additional ammo for the player's current weapon and other power-ups can be purchased in the weaponry.When the player character comes in contact with an enemy or is downed by enemy fire he loses one life and drops the weapons and keys he is carrying. But these all can be picked up again if they don't fall off-screen.After the penultimate level the player enters again the weapon storage room. But this time the glass cases are holding instead of weapons or items the relatives of the player. Those can be freed in exchange for the collected keys. So to free all relatives it must be ensured that the last armory is entered with six keys. </div>  <div> Weapons & Power-ups : Icon in the WeaponryItemDescriptionFull AutoThe standard hand-held weapon with unlimited ammunition and a long range.3-WayA powerfull hand-held weapon which fires in three directions.

Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World,New World Computing,Electronic Arts,July 1991,genesis,Gates to Another World picks up where the first game left off as a powerful villain that had escaped the party at the end of that adventure threatens the world of CRON with destruction.,3030-19917,19917,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/might-and-magic-ii-gates-to-another-world/3030-19917/,," <div> Overview : The second entry of the Might & Magic RPG series, Gates to Another World would continue its predecessor's open, non-linear world design. Players would continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet. As was popular at the time, many of its conventions appear based on concepts drawn up within the Dungeons and Dragons rule set by TSR.As with the first game, this game had also included a full color map of the world that the game was taking place on (in this case, Crom).Several enhancements were also made to the game over that of its predecessor:the number of spells increasedthe number of mini-quests were substantially increasedsecondary skills were now made available to characters, such as mountaineering (allowing the party to pass through mountain areas) in addition to several otherstwo new classes were added to the game: Barbarian and Ninja.The combat heavy nature of the series would continue with this entry although there were many puzzles and secrets to be discovered within the game. Characters from the first game can also be transferred into this one but with the following restrictions:Gold is set to 1000Food is set to 40Gems less than or equal to 100 remain the same while those numbering over 100 are reduced to 100Character levels less than 7 remain the same. Those 7 and above are reset to 7 if the first game was successfully completed, or to 6 if it was not.Special sub-quests for character classes were also included in the game to enhance their abilities. </div>  <div> Story : The Super Nintendo saw two separate adaptations of Might and Magic II:The European version was developed by Iguana Entertainment (later Acclaim Studios Austin) and published by Elite. This version was to be ported to the US by Sammy, but was canceled. This version is almost identical to the Genesis version.Japan saw a separate Super Famicom release named Might and Magic: Book II. It was developed by Starcraft and published by LOZC/G Amusements. This version never left Japan. It was rebuilt from scratch to be more like contemporary Japanese RPGs, such as Shin Megami Tensei and Dragon Quest. </div>  <div> Gameplay : As revealed at the end of the first Might and Magic, there is a considerable degree of sci-fi technology working behind the scenes of the world of VARN. The series' use of this would continue on through each one of the party-based RPG titles in the series and would usually be revealed close to the endgame.In Gates to Another World, the game picks up almost immediately following the events of Secret of the Inner Sanctrum. The party had uncovered a plot in the last game by an evil, otherworldly villain, Sheltem, who had escaped at the end by entering a gate to the world of Cron. It was also discovered that another being, Corak, had been pursuing him in Varn before he had escaped and now it falls to the characters to stop him. After many adventures and quests that take the party to the elemental planes and back again to the world of Cron, they finally track Sheltem down after assisting Corak.They confront him and his guards, but he manages to escape but not before telling them that CRON and all of its VARNs are heading into the sun. CRON is actually a massive ship and VARN is apparently one of its nacelles, a self contained world that is connected. Together, they have been set on a collision course and only the party can save both CRON and its VARNs.Sheltem has locked the controls and taunts the party with a recorded message revealing that he is the ruler of a world called Terra. He tells them that CRON and its VARNs were programmed by the Ancients to populate Terra, but he will not tolerate whom he believes to be inferiors polluting his race. However, in his arrogance, he has provided a cryptogram that must be deciphered with the clues given in order to change the course of CRON and save it and themselves from a fiery death.After solving the puzzle, it is revealed that what Sheltem had told them was partly the truth. CRON was created to populate Terra. But Sheltem is still missing and Corak has continued his search to stop his nemesis. The story continues in the third Might and Magic, the Isles of Terra. </div>  <div> Combat : The open ended gameplay was centered around a six person party with the world seen from a first person perspective utilizing rudimentary 3D graphics for the outdoor locations and indoor dungeons. Monsters along with certain other encounters were displayed as 2D pictures. As was the norm at the time for several RPG titles, movement was centered aroud a grid based scheme which meant 90 degree turns and square-based movement forward or back.The game was also considered quite detailed as well as difficult. Players were required to maintain a stock of food in order to be able to rest outside of an in to regain hit and spell points. Bashing open locked doors would often set off traps if they were not disarmed. Leveling was not automatic.Once a character had earned the requisite experience, it must be spent at a training ground in order to improve their statistics and abilities. Gems were often required to cast higher level spells and characters could also die from old age (natural or not), although the proper spells could alleviate its effects. Characters could also be afflicted with a number of debilitating conditions which often proved incredibly fatal to starting parties. Sex and alignment would also restrict certain characters from entering specific areas or in equipping certain items.Saves are handled at Inns within each town making it particularly dangerous to get caught far from their walls in dangerous territory. They are the only places where players may save the game.Towns and dungeons were all divided into 16 by 16 squares and the game used a  grid-based movement system with 90 degree turns. </div> "

However, the game lacks the MLB license to accompany it, and so all the team names are simply city names.The game was later released in Japan as Fighting Baseball in 1995. This localization is notorious for its made up ""American-sounding"" names like Bobson Dugnutt and Mike Truk, as the MLBPA license did not extend to that version.

Sports Talk Baseball,Sega CS,Sega,June 1992[26],genesis,Sports Talk Baseball was Sega's 2nd baseball release on the Genesis.

It originally began as Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 in Japanese markets, which would later be followed by Pro Yakyuu Super League CD for the Mega-CD system.The game is credited for being one of the earliest baseball games to have a play-by-play announcer narrating the game in progress, using the same commentary tech that Sega had premiered in their football sequel Joe Montana II: Sports Talk Football released a few months prior. STB also fully rated every player in several skill categories, as well as including battery-powered memory for season W-L tracking: players have to complete three games before the game would save their progress, however. While several wonky features did make it into the game (the speech lagged terribly behind play, AI base-running and attempting to throw runners out had lots of quirks, 10-run slaughter rule), STB was well-regarded for its time. The Japanese version of the game lacked the commentary track, but instead had a few scattered sound samples as well as ouendan music (i.e. a cheering squad, who would play music during the game with taiko drums and horns).Trivia: The winning team always had a picture of the game MVP in the post-game scoreboard. It was always the same player for each winning team, no matter if that person played or how they performed. </div> "

Raiden, at the end of the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, sends a message to his past self (right before his death at the hands of Shao Kahn) warning him about the armageddon. The past Raiden receives the message prior to the original Mortal Kombat tournament, not fully understanding the visions, and attempts to influence the course of events (with some interesting consequences). The story progresses through the original Mortal Kombat tournament, the Outworld tournament, and Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm.Mortal Kombat is the first in the franchise to feature guest fighters, including Kratos from the God of War series (exclusive to the PS3 and VITA versions only) and Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street horror franchise (as a downloadable character).The PlayStation 3 demo version of the game was made available to the PlayStation Network exclusively to PlayStation Plus members on March 8, 2011. A week later, it was made available to all PSN users. It includes four playable characters (Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Mileena, and Sub-Zero), two playable stages (The Living Forest and The Pit), and two game modes (the 1v1 arcade ladder and 1v1 versus).Mortal Kombat is outlawed in several countries (such as Germany) due to its extreme violence. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Mortal Kombat makes a departure from the previous 3D games of the franchise by putting the fighting strictly in a 2D plane (used in early Mortal Kombat installments), meaning that players can no-longer sidestep (or move around in a 3D plane) and all arenas have the same size and shape.The game utilizes the five-button setup of the first two Mortal Kombat games (two Punch buttons, two Kick buttons, and a Block button). However, taking its cue from the Tekken franchise, each of the four attack buttons represents a limb on the character's body (Front or Back) instead of whether the attack is High or Low.Players can flip their character's stance by either pressing the Flip Stance button or by pressing both Kick buttons simultaneously, dash forwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction towards the opponent, dash backwards by tapping the joystick/d-pad twice in the direction away from the opponent, and throw the opponent by either pressing the Throw button or pressing Front Punch and Front Kick buttons simultaneously. If the player is holding the joystick/d-pad in the direction towards the opponent when executing a Throw, he throws his opponent forward. Otherwise, he throws his opponent behind him. In Tag-Team matches where players have multiple teammates, they have access to a Tag button, which is used to swap teammates and perform special team attacks. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Mortal Kombat builds upon the Power Meter concept (introduced in the franchise by Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe) by including three tiers of special attacks (each using a specified amount of the meter to use). Players start with one-third (one bar) of the meter full, and can fill up the meter by performing special moves, getting hit by an opponent's attack, or getting their attack blocked. In the first round, the first person to successfully land an attack earns another bar of their meter instantly.Enhanced Special Moves (uses one bar) - An enhanced version of a special move that can inflict more damage, add additional attacks, or changes the properties of the move (such as adding armor properties), which is executed by combining the activation of the special move with the Block button.Breakers (uses two bars) - A simple combo breaker that is executed during an opponent's combo by holding Forward and Block as the opponent connects another attack. It immediately knocks down the opponent (though dealing no damage), escaping further combo damage while giving positional advantage.X-Ray Attacks (uses all thee bars) - Executed by pressing either the Flip Stance and Block buttons or the Front Kick, Back Kick, and Block Buttons simultaneously, the character performs a starting attack. If it connects successfully, the character goes into an animated sequence of powerful attacks (that shows close-up X-Ray animations of the damage being dealt internally). Each character has a unique X-Ray Attack, sometimes using special properties (for example, Johnny Cage's X-Ray Attack starts with a counter move, while Stryker's X-Ray Attack starts with armor properties). </div>  <div> Characters : Mortal Kombat introduces tag team combat (in a similar vein to the Marvel vs. Capcom series) to the franchise as an optional feature, pitting two fighters against two other fighters. Unlike 2-vs-2 modes in previous Mortal Kombat games (in with the second fighter can only fight when the first fighter is defeated), fighters can be swapped out on-the-fly, as well as jump in for a quick tag-team attack. When one fighter is defeated, the other fighter on the team immediately jumps in (without the ability to swap out or perform tag-team attacks). Each round ends when both fighters in a team are defeated. In some occasions, matches are played with uneven teams (such as 1-vs-2 matches in Story Mode where the human player is outnumbered).Mortal Kombat allows four human players to form two teams, with each player controlling only one fighter. This mode can be played online (with teams of two local players) and co-operatively in the Tag Ladder Mode. </div>  <div> Plot : Each character in Mortal Kombat is equipped with two Fatalities, which are special finishing moves (animations showing an gruesome and painful kill) that can be performed via special button combinations by the winning player at the end of the match. One of these combinations is visible from the start in the character's Move List. The other ""hidden"" Fatality becomes visible in the Move List either when the player performs the Fatality for the first time or unlocks it in the Krypt.Returning from the old Mortal Kombat games are Stage Fatalities (which can only be performed at certain stages and, unlike most 3D Mortal Kombat games, cannot be executed during the middle of a match) and Babalities (which transforms your opponent into a baby, this time showing a cutesy animation of the baby humiliating itself). The combinations of both Stage Fatalities and Babalities are completely hidden, requiring the player to have outside knowledge. Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Reptile also each have a hidden Classic Fatality (based on Fatalities from the first two Mortal Kombat games) that can only be performed if the player has downloaded their Classic Costumes. </div>  <div> Special Editions : The traditional Arcade Mode of Mortal Kombat, Ladder Mode requires players to defeat ten opponents, one at a time, each fight increasing in difficulty (though the base difficulty level is chosen before the first fight). The first seven fights are against random opponents in random stages while the final three matches are pre-determined (first Shang Tsung with his alternate costume and the ability to automatically transform into his opponent and two other fighters, then either Goro or Kintaro, and then Shao Kahn). Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> "

Players can earn Koins for both the Krypt and Challenge Tower Modes by doing combos, winning matches, performing finishing moves, and achieving Flawless Victories (winning rounds with full health).In a homage to old Mortal Kombat games, Ladder Mode includes hidden opponents that can only be fought by meeting special circumstances that are cryptic and sometimes very difficult (such as defeating an opponent with two Flawless Victories in a specific stage that is under a random condition). These four opponents ( Jade, Smoke, Reptile, and Noob Saibot) fight using their Classic Costumes with an arsenal of special moves representing their secret appearances in previous games (for example, Jade has some of Kitana's moves and Reptile has some of Scorpion and Sub-Zero's moves). Participating in these battles earns the player some Koins as well as hidden achievements/ trophies. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Similar to Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the game's Story Mode is divided up into 16 chapters, each one putting the player in control of a different character. Cutscenes are played in-between fights to progress the game's story. </div> "
Mortal Kombat 3,Sculptured Software,Williams Entertainment,"October 13, 1995",genesis,"Set in a post-apocalyptic Earthrealm (invaded by Shao Kahn's army of Outworld), Mortal Kombat 3 is the third installment of one of the most violent fighting game franchises of all time.",3030-1434,1434,0,1995-04-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat-3/3030-1434/,ESRB: M," <div> Overview :  Raiden decides to take a vacation.Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway for arcades on April 1995.The third installment of the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat 3 revamps the character roster of its predecessor while changing the setting to a more contemporary urban city on Earthrealm. It also updates the control scheme (by adding a sixth ""Run"" button) while adding selectable difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos, mid-fight stage transitions, the ""Mercy"" system, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special multiplayer pre-match codes known as ""Kombat Kodes"".Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's ""cyber-assassin"" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.The game later received a major revision in November 1995, known as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, that added new characters (including the return of masked human ninjas), new game modes (including 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), new backgrounds, and updated character movelists. It was further updated on with the console-exclusive game Mortal Kombat Trilogy a year later.Along with 16-bit console conversions (by Sculptured Software) for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System and handheld conversions (by Software Creations) for the Game Boy and Game Gear (the latter exclusively in Europe), the original game also received a port by Williams to the 32-bit Sony PlayStation shortly after that console's North American release. The game also received two versions for PCs: a MS-DOS version by Sculptured Software and a Windows version by Williams (the latter being a port of the PS1 version). All of the original ports were released by Williams (with the European version co-released by Acclaim). The game was also included two compilations: the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube, and the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures: Deluxe Edition for the PC. </div>  <div> Gameplay :  Mortal Kombat ""X"" Control Panel with the new run buttonThe gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a ""Run Meter"", which limits the use of running.Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a ""chain combo"" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny!The game also introduces the concept of ""Choose Your Destiny"", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different ""towers"", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a ""Kombat Kode"") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an ""Ultimate Kombat Kode""). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working ""Ultimate Kombat Kode"" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character. </div>  <div> Characters : ANIMALITY! Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II). </div>  <div> Arenas :  The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)The original arcade release included 15 playable characters (one of which must be unlocked beforehand), two unplayable boss characters, and one unplayable hidden opponent for a total of 18 combatants.Along with final boss Shao Kahn, eight characters return from previous games in the series. All returning characters have different appearances (including Jax sporting metal arms, Sub-Zero fighting un-masked, and secret character Smoke being a cybernetic). </div>  <div> Versions and Ports :  Cyrax (Sal Divita) - One of three prototype Cybernetic Ninjas built by the Lin Kuei, unit LK-4D4 (also known as Cyrax) is sent to find a terminate the rogue Sub-Zero.

Ms. Pac-Man,Tengen,Tengen,July 1991,genesis,"A sequel to the arcade classic featuring Pac-Man's feminine counterpart. The game is notable for having a variety of mazes as opposed to the single maze design in the original game, as well as bonus items that wandered through the mazes rather than appearing just in the center.",3030-6332,6332,0,1982-02-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls). </div> "

Originally a Wii-exclusive, it was later released on November 17, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, featuring upgraded HD visuals and online play. (This version was originally planned to be a feature-limited downloadable title included with new copies of the unreleased NBA Elite 11, but was later made a retail release.)Unlike previous Acclaim-developed installments of the franchise, the 2010 installment features gameplay and aesthetics reminiscent of Midway's original NBA Jam. (With help from the original designer, Mark Turmell, who worked with EA Tiburon at the time, and Tim Kitzrow, the iconic announcer of the original game, who shouted famous catchphrases such as ""Boomshakalaka!"" and ""He's on fire!"").Building upon the 2010-2011 NBA roster, the game features a ""Remix Tour"" campaign (featuring new crazy features such as power-ups, new camera angles, and boss battles) and special ""legend"" characters (legendary former NBA players). The game also brings back special guest characters and easter eggs from the original, such as former president Bill Clinton, hip-hop band Beastie Boys, and Big Head Mode, while adding new, modern secret characters, such as presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush.An enhanced version, titled NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) and the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on October 4, 2011. On January 11th, 2013, the online servers for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the original game were shut down. </div>  <div> Gameplay : NBA Jam is a fast-pace arcade style 2-on-2 basketball game that plays very similarly to the 1993 arcade game of the same name. Their are no fouls in NBA Jam other than goal tending (interfering with the ball when it is on the way to the basket) and shot clock violation (24 second shot clock expires before a shot is taken). Since there are only those two fouls, players have the ability to shove their opponents in an attempt to jar the basketball loose. In order to counter this, a new spin move has been added to the series. If the player spins just as they are about to be shoved they will spin out of the shove causing the opposing player to stagger over. Another new offensive move added to the series is a crossover move. A successful counter will cause the opponent to stagger for a moment giving the player a chance to score a bucket. Players also have the ability to perform alley-oops by passing the ball to an airborne teammate or by going up for an alley-oop themselves and having their teammate pass it to them.Trail of fireIf the player manages to score 3 times in a row they will become ""on fire"" (points scored via goal tending violations do not count). When on fire the player has unlimited turbo, better shot making ability, and the ability to perform gravity defying dunks. The only way to put out an opposing players fire is by scoring a bucket (scoring via a goal tending violation will not put out an opposing players fire). If the players on fire status has not been put out after 5 possessions, it will automatically go out.Game TypesIn addition to the classic 2v2 game, several new modes have been added including 21, Smash, Domination, Elimination and 2v2 Remix. Classic Campaign only features the classic 2v2 game while Remix Tour features the other game types.In 21 the player is stacked up against 1 to 3 AI opponents in a race to 21 points. Only half the court is used and the perspective changes from a sideline view to a view positioned at the players back. The first player to reach 21 points wins the game. It also is make it take it, meaning the last player to score gets the ball back.In Smash the object of the game is to weaken the opposing teams backboard by performing dunks and alley-oops. Regular shots also do damage, but the damage is minimal. Each successful dunk, alley-oop or shot takes life off of the opposing teams backboard. Once the opponents backboard's life meter is completely empty, the backboard's glass shatters and the game ends with the player who shattered the backboard winning the game. The killing blow to the backboard must be a dunk or an alley-oop and not a lay-up or a jump shot.In Domination the object of the game is to gain spots on the court by scoring a basket while standing inside the spot. As in 21, the game is played half court with the camera to the players back and the game can be played in teams of 2 or free-for-all. There are five spots on the court: 4 placed on the three point line and 1 in the ""paint"". Once a player has control of a spot they continually gain points from it until either the opposing player takes the spot or the spot expires after a certain period of time. The first team or player to reach 100 points wins the game.Elimination is similar to 21 in many aspects, the only difference is that now the objective is to be the last man standing. The game is played in rounds, each round ends after a set period of time and the player with the lowest score is eliminated. This continues until only 1 player is left and that player wins the game. If 2 players tie for the lowest score then they both are eliminated.2v2 Remix is identical to classic 2v2 except that it contains power-ups. Power-ups can provide benefits such as increasing the players speed or strength. However, one power-up shrinks the player having a negative impact on their ability to make shots. Power-ups randomly show up on the court and can be collected by simply walking over them.Magic Johnson boss battleCampaignsNBA Jam features two different campaign modes, Classic Campaign and Remix Tour. Classic Campaign is similar to the older NBA Jam games, it pits the player against all NBA teams (except for the team chosen by the player to avoid the same team playing against itself). In addition to the games against NBA teams, their are also legend battles which pits the player against former NBA legends. Beating the legends unlocks them as playable characters.Remix Tour has the player traveling through divisions defeating NBA teams in the various game types in order to earn trophies. Each NBA team has a bronze, silver, and gold trophy associated with them. Beating the team once earns the bronze trophy, twice the silver, and three times the gold. Remix Mode also features boss battles which puts the player up against a recognizable NBA star that has been given super-human or super-natural abilities. For example, in the boss battle with Magic Johnson, Magic Johnson has the ability to teleport around the court making him very hard to guard. After the player has earned all the trophies from all the NBA teams and after the credits have finished, they will enter one last game against The Beastie Boys in a game of 21. Defeating them unlocks them as playable characters </div>  <div> Standard Roster : The standard roster for NBA Jam includes the 30 standard teams from the 2010-2011 NBA season. Unlike the original NBA Jam, in which teams are divided in the Team Selection Screen into Eastern and Western conferences, this installment lists all teams alphabetically. Each team has 3-4 standard players, and most teams have additional unlockable ""legends"" (Former NBA players). </div>  <div> Hidden Roster : Southeast Division.

NBA Jam Tournament Edition,Iguana Entertainment,Acclaim Entertainment,"February 23, 1995",genesis,"Midway's signature rules-light two-on-two arcade basketball game gets revamped, now with a bigger roster and more features.",3030-14792,14792,0,1994-01-17,https://www.giantbomb.com/nba-jam-tournament-edition/3030-14792/,ESRB: K-A," <div> Overview : NBA Jam: Tournament Edition (also known as NBA Jam T.E.) is a belt-scrolling basketball game developed and released by Midway for arcades in January 1994.An updated sequel to the 1993 game NBA Jam, Tournament Edition revamps the player roster for the 1993-94 NBA season while fine-tuning the gameplay and allowing more than two basketball players per team to choose from (in which players can choose their team composition before and half-way through each game). It also features ""Tournament Mode"", which disables all cheat codes and special characters while reducing the ""rubber-banding"" effect in player-vs-player matches.The game received home console ports through 1995-1996, first for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, and Game Gear, then for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Jaguar, Sega 32X, MS-DOS PCs, and Game Boy. These were published by Acclaim, and most were ported by Iguana Entertainment, with the GB version ported by Torus Games and the Jaguar version ported by High Voltage Software. These versions include an updated roster (from the 1994-95 NBA season) and new game options (including power-up icons, ""hot spots"", faster game speed, and an injury system).Both early arcade versions and the console ports are known for building up their list of unique hidden characters, with the early arcade versions including guest characters from the studio's Mortal Kombat series (which were removed shortly after release) and the console versions including some NBA mascots, retired sports icons, the American rap group Beastie Boys, the American hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Charles, Prince of Wales.Some of the console ports were later used for the spin-off College Slam, while the original arcade version later received a successor with NBA Hangtime. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the ""Turbo"" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the ""???"" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the ""Quick Hands"" and ""Max Power"" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.All versions of the game also include ""Power-up"" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up. </div>  <div> Teams & Players : Hotspots enabledSome additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. ""Hot Spots"" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. ""Power-up"" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant ""on fire,"" or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a ""Juice"" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.The console releases also added an ""Injury"" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.Console releases also include an optional ""Tag Mode"" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions. </div> "

NHL '94,High Score Productions,Electronic Arts,September 1993,genesis,The 1994 entry in EA's ice hockey series. It is widely considered the best of the NHL series and one of the best hockey games ever made.,3030-20166,20166,0,1993-03-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-94/3030-20166/,," <div> Overview : NHL 94 is a vertically-oriented ice hockey simulation based on the same game engine behind NHLPA 93. NHL 94 makes playable all NHL teams (active at the end of the 1993 season), complete with robust (though incomplete) player rosters, in addition to the East and West conference All-Star teams. Various player attributes (e.g. speed, aggression, shot) are ranked based on a 100 point system and affect the way players perform in the game. </div>  <div> New Features Introduced : These features were added from EA Sports's previous game NHLPA 93:Goalie ControlShootout GamePenalty ShotsBench and Board Checks3 or 4 Player Compatible with Adapter (5 players on SNES)1992-93 Player Ratings & RostersVariable Player Ratings when on Hot/Cold StreaksSave Player Records for each playerSave User Standings and RecordsOne-times and Special Moves by Selected PlayersNew Player StatsFlip PassesReverse-Angle ReplayClear the zone while killing penaltiesAutomatic Line Changes (can manually change lines at play stoppage)Tougher Computer DefenseTougher GoaliesComputer Shooting Scoring MovesPlayer and Team CardsPlayer Profiles with 144 Player PicturesLogan Organ Music matches Home ArenaTeam logos at center iceNew crowd animationsNo fighting or bloodPeriod StatsMore kinds of game statsTwo expansion teams (Anaheim and Florida) </div>  <div> Innovation : NHL 94 has been lauded as one of the best sports games ever made. It iterated on the innovative NHLPA 93 engine, adding smoother sprite animation and a host of new gameplay mechanics. Perhaps the most important of the newly introduced gameplay features was the ability to perform a one-timer. (For the non-initiated, a one-timer is when the puck is passed to a player and the intended recipient shoots the puck immediately, without pause.) The one-timer proved to be one of the most accessible scoring options in the game. Scoring was also made easier by the inclusion of a more robust deke mechanic with NHL 94 (at least in the SNES version of the game). In addition, players were also able to save their user records.NHL 94 also evolved from its predecessor by reducing the frequency of slap-shot goals scored through the goalie’s five-hole and stopping the ability to run into the goalie and have the puck the active player was carrying drift into the net. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature included in NHLPA 93 and omitted from NHL 94 was the ability to fight opponents. Fighting returned with NHL 95. </div>  <div> Game Modes : Regular SeasonPlayoffsBest of Seven PlayoffsShootoutExhibition </div>  <div> NHL Teams & Rankings : The following is a chart of the 26 NHL teams featured in NHL 94 and their rankings, strengths and weaknesses.

The main menu looks rather different from one version to the next, the SNES version adopting a much more basic design. There are also slight graphical differences during gameplay. Possibly the most significant difference is that the SNES version will not track players' statistics from one game to the next (for example, to see which player on a team is leading in goals scored during playoff mode). </div>  <div> Ron Barr's Quotes : Welcome to a sold out {insert arena], home of the [insert home team]Hi I'm Ron Barr for EA Sports... and in goal tonight [goalie name] for [team] and [goalie name] for [opposing team]For [team name], [player name] is on a hot streak, but [player name] is on a cold streak.The [arena] crowd record is [number] db.Hit the Start button to begin, Use the A and C to cycle through menus.Lately [team name] has been playing well ...

Onslaught,Code Monkeys Ltd.,Ballistic,July 1991,genesis,"Onslaught is a WiiWare FPS by Hudson, which pits the player against countless hordes of insect cyborgs on a distant planet.",3030-25251,25251,0,2009-02-23,https://www.giantbomb.com/onslaught/3030-25251/,CERO: C," <div> Gameplay :  Gameplay is quite unique in Onslaught, compared to most First Person Shooters. In a standard FPS game, players would be required to move from one place to another, while encountering gunfights along the way, in order to advance the story. In Onslaught, the primary objective is not to get from A to B, but to obtain the most points by completing the assigned mission at hand. Missions range from many things, they may be to hold back several waves of insect cyborgs from destroying your base or passing a certain point on the map, they might be to destroy all of the enemy hives in an underground cavern, or to reach your teammates before the time limit runs out to protect them from incoming enemies. If a player fails the mission by either dying or failing the unique objective, they are forced to begin the entire mission over again, with no checkpoints. Insect cyborgs have three types of skin: Flesh, metal and core.Each mission has it's own unique objective, after completing each, the game assesses the player based on how many kills they obtained, how long they took to complete the mission or how much time is remaining, how much life they had at the end of the mission and other elements, with the final score receiving a letter rank, with A being the highest possible. There are 13 missions in total in the game, broken up into several tiers. Each tier has 3 regular missions and a boss mission, with two boss missions at the end of the game. The 3 regular missions are playable in any order, however all 3 must be completed before the player can attempt the boss mission.  </div>  <div> Online :    Onslaught also has compatibility with Nintendo WFC, enabling another two modes of play as well as the story mode. The first is ""Free Battle"", in which up to 4 players will team up to attempt a mission from the regular story mode, however while all of the players are working together, the focus still remains on the high score, as the game keeps tally during each mission and totals everyone's scores at the end of the mission. In Free Battle, it is not impossible to shoot your teammates, but each time you do, rather than damage them, you take damage yourself, however you cannot die completely, if you lose all of your health, instead of restarting the mission again, you are re spawned with your score drastically reduced, ready to continue fighting. The second online mode is ""Ranking Battle"", in which the 2 to 4 players are placed in a level with swarms of various insect cyborgs, along with a boss towards the center of the level. The players are now against each other and must obtain as many points as possible by whatever method they see fit. The players still cannot shoot one another, though, the same punishment applies to those who do, the same is true for if the player dies. The round ends after a set period of time, with the player with the highest score claiming victory. </div>  <div> Controls :  Bug Blood will quickly eat at your armor if you don't wipe it off. Controls in Onslaught are, much like many Wii controls, easy to grasp. The pointer and B button aim and shoot, naturally, while the A button co-ordinates your NPC allies to three different positions, whether you wish to focus fire-power in front of you, cover a wide area or keep watch on any enemies coming up from behind you. Waving the Wii Remote reloads the current gun in your hands, during which time you are unable to perform any other action, while waving the Nunchuk will wipe off any bug blood that gets splattered on your visor by close range insect cyborgs. The C and Z buttons prepare the two sidearm weapons, with another swing of the Nunchuk to use them. </div>  <div> Weaponry :  There are only 4 main weapons in Onslaught, along with two sidearms and one vehicle that is available in some missions. The first is the assault rifle, which does adequate damage, ranges fairly far and fires in short bursts, it is used mostly against tougher enemies that have small weak points. The second is the minigun, which has a much higher bullet capacity, firing speed and reload, however only does about half of the damage of the assault rifle, used primarily for fire fights against enemies with larger weak points. The third gun is the shotgun, which carries a small load and is best in small ranges with enemies that move around erratically, as opposed to stationary enemies. The last main weapon is the rocket launcher, which can only carry six shots at a time and reloads very slowly, however it has the highest damage of all guns, causes splash damage, works at a very long range and can lock on to all of it's targets. Each gun also has 10 reload cartridges, which refill all ammo in the gun and can be found around the levels at various points. The two sidearms are the grenades, of which the player has 10, and the beam whip, which can cut through normal enemies in one or two swings, but can run out of energy fairly fast, however it does recharge while it is out of use. The vehicle is considered to be the ""ultimate weapon"", it is the ""BKD-G9"", a tank-like jeep, mounted with 2 miniguns, not only can it run over the bugs and kill them, albeit doing damage to the vehicle itself, it can tear through even the toughest insect cyborgs in a matter of seconds, these are usually only available in missions that will require the player to use it just to survive the mission, to get to a location in time, or to push through a large group of bugs that would be other wise impossible to break through. Pesky garden bugs? Try the BKD-G9, with the new killing formula!The downside of the BKD-G9 is that it has limited ammo, depending on the mission it will have between 1 and 3 thousand shots, that can't be refilled, after which the weapon can be set to run into the bugs as a last ditch attack, after a few seconds of running on it's own, the vehicle explodes and takes out a large area of the insect cyborgs, particularly useful in missions that require the player to defend something. </div> "

Developed by the Sega Technical Institute and published by its parent company, it was originally intended as a launch title for the Sega Nomad handheld, but was instead released as a Genesis game. This game was later added on to Sonic Mega Collection Plus as an unlockable title. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Ooze takes place from an top-down perspective. The main character is a puddle of ooze with a head. He can move around and has two attacks. One is stretching out a steerable pseudopod of ooze whose length is only limited by how much ooze he currently has to attack, which can also be guided around with the control pad. He can also spit gobs of ooze, although this takes off a bit of his puddle. Enemy attacks can cut off a bit of the ooze, and the player will die either if his puddle of ooze is reduced to a very small amount or if his head is attacked directly. He can also die by dropping off the edges of certain areas, or staying on a drain for too long. </div>  <div> Story : The Ooze starts with Dr. Caine, an excellent scientist who invented an achromatic odorless toxic gas and its antidote. He sneaked into the research lab where he worked in order to find evidence that crimes were being conducted by using the toxic gas he created. He was discovered by his colleagues and disposed of by means of chemical waste. Little did his former colleagues know that the chemicals did not kill him; instead, they altered him into The Ooze.Swearing revenge, the doctor sought two things: his former colleagues and to assume his human form once again. He must find the DNA helices scattered throughout the wasteland or else end up in a jar. </div> "

As with those games, emphasis is placed on individual commanders and their abilities, and the game prioritizes tactics and numbers over graphical prowess. The player can choose from a list of real WW2 commanders to fill their general staff for each scenario. Commanders' skill levels in various different areas are randomly generated, but the RNG is biased so that historically successful commanders (Rommel, Patton, de Gaulle, etc) tend to have higher skills than commanders who suffered significant defeats (Corap, etc).The player issues commands to a number of different regiments under his/her control on a 2D map of the scenario area. When a regiment engages in combat with an enemy regiment or city, gameplay changes to an isometric battle mode where commands can be issued to individual units within the division.The following scenarios are available:Occupation of FranceNorth African WarFierce Battles at KurskStorming of NormandyBattle of the BulgeFight for Berlin </div> "

The first game had multiple routes to take and was primarily a time based racer. While the second game had a more serious approach to racing. OutRunners wanted to bring back the same gameplay from OutRun, mainly the choice of routes during races. OutRunners brought multiplayer to the normal OutRun formula, where multiple arcade cabinets were used for this purpose, allowing up to eight players to race against each other. </div>  <div> Gameplay : You will see a variety of locationsA race in OutRunners begins in a central location, and each time you come across a checkpoint you are able to turn left or right to change your route. OutRunners takes you through locations all around the world, and the routes will take you across different hemispheres of the world depending on your route. In a two player game you are racing another person the end of a race, and who ever is in first is able to choose the route the race may follow. In a single player game you do not compete against a computer controlled opponent. Single player races are played similarly to the original OutRun where you are simply racing the clock.There are multiple vehicles to choose from in OutRunners which is a first in the series. In the arcade release there are 8 different vehicles to choose from, and each has its own specific statistics. The statistics mainly cover the speed and handling of a vehicle. Each vehicle also bares a resemblance to some real live vehicles. The cars include Easy Handling, Smooth Operator, Bad Boy, Quick Reactor, The Road Monster, Mad Power, Wild Chaser and the Speed Buster. Each car is also piloted by two different characters to add a bit of personality to the cars.A returning aspect of OutRun to OutRunners is the music in the game. In the original you were able to choose the music that you wanted to hear throughout your game. In OutRunners there is entire radio station where you can change the music to your liking. The music used is usually associated to the different locations throughout the game. </div>  <div> Arcade hardware : The 32-bit Sega System Multi 32 arcade hardware was used:Main CPU: NEC V70 (32-bit @ 20 MHz)Additional CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit @ 8.1 MHz)FM Sound Chip: Yamaha YM3438 (@ 8.1 MHz)PCM Sound Chip: Sega MultiPCM (@ 8.1 MHz) </div>  <div> Port : Data East ported OutRunners to the Sega Genesis, and it retained all the same gameplay and elements.

Pac-Man) is a side-scrolling adventure game developed and published by Namco for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis throughout 1994.Although the English title hints that the game is a sequel to the original arcade game, it is actually a spin-off title and a spiritual successor to the side-scrolling platformer Pac-Land. Rather than directly controlling Pac-Man, players instead control a cursor that is used both to interact with objects (using a slingshot) and to communicate with the autonomous (and moody) Pac-Man himself (often breaking the fourth wall).The game's plot involves the wacky misadventures of the titular hero, who must complete a series of tasks for his family (including fetching milk for Pac-Baby and finding a stolen guitar for Pac-Jr.) while avoiding destruction by the four ghosts (Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde) and their mysterious leader.Also hidden in the game are ports of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, (the latter modified as ""Pac-Jr."" in the Genesis version, changing the player character to Pac-Jr.).The SNES version of the game was digitally re-released for the Wii U (via Virtual Console) on October 8, 2015 in Europe and on March 3, 2016 in North America. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The player is equipped with a sling shot and can shoot at points of interest to bring them to Pac-Man's attention. The player may also tell Pac-Man which way he should go. Pac-Man, however, has a mind of his own and will grow increasingly frustrated if the player leads him into harm's way too many times, and he might just completely ignore the player if he gets too angry. The game also contains super pellets which can be given to Pac-Man at any point to have him transform into Super Pac-Man. In fact, when the ghosts appear throughout random points in the game, Pac-Man is left in paralyzing fear. If the player has run out of super pallets before eliminating all the ghosts, Pac-Man faints.In the first stage of the game, Pac-Man is tasked with stopping by the farm and picking up milk for Baby Pac. The next section of the game leads Pac-Man to the mountains in search of a flower for Lucy. This section also contains a hand-gliding section in which the player guides Pac-Man in the proper direction. In the third section, Pac-Man must retrive Pac Jr.'s stolen guitar which leads Pac-Man to the city and eventually to a mine cart section that controls much like the hand gliding section. The final stage begins with a broadcast of the ghosts stealing all the ABC gum in the city followed by a message from the Ghost Witch of Netor who goes onto warn Pac-Man of her near completed Gum Monster. Pac-Man must search for the abandoned factory which houses the Gum-Monster and turn into Super Pac-Man to defeat it and all the ghosts. Upon defeating the Gum Monster Pac-Man is congratulated by his friends, family, and the citizens town, but then scolded for not being able to save their ABC gum. </div> "

The core game play is similar to original Pac-Man, with the goal being to eat dots, and eat ghosts after eating the power pellets. However, the main distinguishing feature is that in Pac-Mania, Pac-Man can jump to avoid ghosts. However, as the game progresses, the ghosts also attain the ability to jump, thus making them that much more dangerous. </div> "

Developed internally by SEGA/Sonic Team, PSO2 is a sequel to the original Dreamcast/PC RPG Phantasy Star Online. The game was announced at TGS 2010 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the original Phantasy Star Online's release. The game went through a closed and open beta period in the early months of 2012, and released in Japan for the PC on July 4, 2012. The mobile version of the game is currently slated for a Q4 2012 release and the PS Vita version is being targeted for Japanese release in early 2013. All versions of the game will run on the same servers, allowing players to use the same characters cross-platform, though the versions set to appear on mobile phone platforms are said to be reduced versions of the game. On July 9th, 2012, SEGA announced plans to localize the game for North American and European territories.

The three classes have unique weapons, though all three can use the Gunslash, a melee/ranged weapon that swaps from one mode to the other on command. </div>  <div> Quests : Xeno, a Hunter AI partner.The Hunter class is the melee class, and they focus on up-close damage with swords and photon arts. They have a higher HP count and the ability to chain attacks infinitely. PA attacks can be comboed into regular attacks, and proper timing can chain any combination of regular and PA attacks an unlimited number of times. </div>  <div> Free-to-Play : A Ranger player character.The Ranger class is the ranged class, and they focus on long-distance damage with rifles and launchers. They have a more average HP/PP count and have a variety of attack types. Rangers can use either Assault Rifles or Launchers. Assault Rifles are all three-shot burst and fire regular bullets by default. Equipping different Photon Arts can add rocket launcher, shotgun, sniper, or magic attributes to the weapons. Launchers fire single-shot rockets, and equipping different PA change the explosive effect of the rockets such as bigger splash damage or clustered explosions. </div>  <div> Content Updates : Echo, a Force AI partner.The Force class is the casting class, focusing on magical abilities with rod weaponry. They have a higher PP count versus a lower HP count and can support a party through healing and buffing, as well as providing offensive support through certain skills. Rather than equipping weapon-specific attacks onto rods and other Force-only weapons, the follow-up Photon Arts for Forces are spells, most of which have an elemental affinity such as fire, ice, and so on. Forces can also cast spells out of the hotbar. </div>  <div> Alpha Testing : The Quest CounterThere are a variety of quest types in the game, with three types of quests (Quest Counter, Client Orders, and the Matter Board) and several sub-types within those. Players are ranked when completing a quest, with the rank being dependent on the number of enemies defeated and the goal completion. The highest rank is the almighty S-rank. </div>  <div> Beta Testing : Quest Counter quests can be accepted at the, quest counter. This is located on the top floor of the ship. </div>  <div> System Requirements : Free Exploration quests are unlocked through Koffee's client orders. These quests are only available after completing all of the Arks quests, and do not contain any in-area objectives. The goal is instead an Emergency Code: Duel, where players must defeat a boss in the third area. These bosses are significantly more difficult than regular or elite enemies and require a bigger time investment to defeat. While Free Exploration quests do not contain objectives within the first two areas, it is possible for one or more Emergency Code mini-quests to appear whilst exploring. </div>  <div> External Links : These are the default quests that can be accepted at the quest counter. They are unlocked in succession after completing the previous stage and have varying completion objectives. These objectives range from killing a certain number of enemies, completing different Emergency Codes, defeating a particular type of enemy. Arks Quests usually involve one or two areas. </div> "
Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom,Sega AM7,Sega,July 1991,genesis,"The third instalment in the Phantasy Star series of RPGs. An epic adventure featuring three generations of characters, PSIII had a slower pace and unique setting that made it the ""black sheep"" of the series.",3030-18253,18253,0,1990-04-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/phantasy-star-iii-generations-of-doom/3030-18253/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Phantasy Star III has always been the most controversial of the critically-acclaimed Phantasy Star series of RPGs. Rieko Kodama, series director and one of Sega's most successful designers, planned to take the universe she created in a new direction, broadening its appeal so that even players new to Phantasy Star would be able to enjoy it -- but time, budget concerns, and a brand new team conspired to produce a game that has been consistently labelled the less-polished, ""black sheep"" of the series since its original Genesis release in 1991. </div>  <div> Development : Original Japanese box for ""Successors of Time: Phantasy Star III"".At the time, Sega was feeling pressure to compete with rival Nintendo, and had cannibalized much of their top talent from the previous Phantasy Star games to form what was to become Sonic Team. The change in focus forced the company to assemble a new group to develop the third Phantasy Star, and they turned to the relatively inexperienced crew that had recently finished the Genesis port of the arcade classic beat-em-up, Golden Axe. Director/Writer and Lead Designer Hirondo Saiki had done some minor development work on Phantasy Star II, but apart from him, none of the Golden Axe staff had any experience with the Phantasy Star series at all. Nonetheless, series director Rieko Kodama felt that the new faces would serve the new, ""fresh"" take on the series. </div>  <div> Plot and Setting : A thousand years before Rhys sets on his adventure; two kingdoms, one led by the swordsman, Orakio, and the other by the sorceress Laya, were engaged in a bitter conflict. A cease-fire was called and a meeting between the two feuding nations wasOrakio and Layamade in an attempt to resolve the conflict peacefully, but the two leaders mysteriously vanished before the meeting could take place. The conflicted sides naturally blamed each other for the disappearance of their leader and all communications between the two were severed. A thousand years pass, and Phantasy Star III's story begins with a blue-haired woman suffering from amnesia washing up on Orakian shores.Phantasy Star III is set 2,000 years* after the events of Phantasy Star II, which allowed the designers to take very unusual directions with the setting and plot - and they did. Probably the most notable feature was the multiple generations of playable characters, as the player chooses who to marry and took control of their sons as the story progress - one of the earliest examples of multiple endings in games.One of the links between the worlds of PS III.The player begins the game in an ostensibly medieval setting as Prince Rhys, a descendant of the hero Orakio, about to be married to a mysterious amnesiac, Maia. The wedding goes poorly when Maia is kidnapped by a dragon from the Layan kingdom, and Rhys is thrust into an epic adventure through seven worlds linked through unusual metallic caves. Along his journey he encounters cyborgs, some of them a thousand years old; submarines and airstrips; cities in the sky; and cryogenically-preserved demi-goddesses, eventually uncovering the secret of the world and saving it from a hidden evil.* - The original Japanese version of PS3 says 2,000 years, but the English version says 1,000. The discrepancy is commonly attributed to translation/localization errors. </div>  <div> Characters : First Generation:RhysRhys: Rhys is the Prince of the Orakian Kingdom of Landen. He is the first playable character in the game and the kidnapping of his fiancee, Maia begins his quest to rescue her from the hands of the Layan Kingdom. Rhys can only use swords, knives, and needles (think rapiers). Due to his Orakian ancestry, Rhys cannot use magical techniques. He's a straight-forward beefy brawler.LyleLyle: Lyle is a very odd man who joins Rhys to help him fix the weather controller on Aridia. He uses staffs and can also use magical techniques, which suggests that he is from Layan ancestry.MieuMieu: Mieu is an ancient Orakian close-quarters combat android, who uses claws for attacks. Despite being a combat android, she can also cast some magic techniques as well. She has been waiting by a lake for a millennium for a descendant of Orakio to command her. Mieu sticks around through all three generations.WrenWren: Wren is an android who specializes in managing and analyzing computer systems and technology. He uses firearms in combat and cannot use magical techniques. He teams up with Rhys in order to fix the weather controller on Aridia and thaw out the entrance to Aquatica. Like Mieu, Wren is also remains a playable character throughout all three generations.LenaLena: Lena is the princess of the Orakian Kingdom of Satera who rescues Rhys from her father's dungeon. Since she's Orakian she's a natural with knives and needles, but no magic techniques.MaiaMaia: Maia was the mysterious woman who washed up on Orakian shores and was taken in by the Royal Family of Landen. She falls in love with and is engaged to Prince Rhys.

He inherits his father's skills with swords and his mother's ability to cast magical techniques.NialNial: Is the main character of the second generation IF Rhys marries Lena at the end of the first generations. Since his mother and father are both full-blooded Orakians, he cannot use magical techniques. However, he's a really strong fighter and uses swords, knives, and needles.TheaThea: Thea is Lyle's daughter and the princess of Shusoran. After Ayn rescues her from her imprisonment in the dungeon of Lensol, she becomes a valuable ally with her use of twin slicers and magical techniques.Sari: Sari is the daughter of Lena and the ruler of Landen and Satera. At first she is Ayn's enemy, but she eventually joins him. She can only use swords, knives, and needles.SirenSiren: Siren is an ancient android who once fought alongside of Orakio a thousand years ago. Since then, he has continued to hold a grudge against Laya's people and has amassed a large army of cyborgs bent on wiping out all of Laya's clan. He's the main antagonist for Ayn's generational storyline.Ryan: Ryan is the leader of the defensive line against Lune, despite being Layan. He mistakes Nial for being in cahoots with Lune, however once Lune shows up to taunt Nial, he realizes that he and Nial share the same goal and joins up with Nial.LayaLaya (younger): Laya is the younger sister of the legendary sorceress and the Queen of Mystoke. She is awakened from a millennium old cryogenic sleep by Nial. She joins Nial in hopes of discovering what happened to her older sister, whom she remember leaving with a man brandishing a black sword. She also becomes a party member in the third generation if the player follows the path of Ayn or Aron. She is an extremely powerful user of magical techniques and uses a bow, just like her sister.LuneLune: Lune is the general of Laya's (older, not younger) forces. He was banished by Orakio a thousand years ago and immersed himself in a cryogenic coma. Upon awakening from his slumber he has amassed a massive force in order to exact revenge against Orakio and the Orakians. He's the main antagonist for Nial's generational storyline.Alair: Alair is Lune's sister, who was also in a cryogenic sleep with her brother. She was captured and imprisoned by the Orakian Kingdom of Divisia during an assault. Once Nial rescues her, she manages to persuade her brother to cease his hostilities.Third Generation:Sean: Sean is the main character for the third generation IF Ayn marries Thea. He lives in Azura with his parents until it is attacked by Siren. He manages to escape the assault and goes on a mission to stop Siren and save his parents and people. Since he's 3/4ths Layan he's not all that strong, but he's got an amazing command of magical techniques.CrysCrys: Crys is the main character IF Ayn marries Sari. He lives in Landen until it is discovered that the planet has shifted off its normal course and is now heading into a nearby sun. He heads up a quest to find a way to set the planet back to its normal orbit. Since Crys is 3/4ths Orakian he's an extremely powerful fighter, but he only knows a few magical techniques.Aron: Aron is the main character IF Nial marries Alair. He lives on Dahlia with his parents, his uncle Lune, and cousin Kara. At the beginning of his generational storyline, his people come into contact with a ship known as Neo Palm (this is Palma from Phantasy Star II) and witness it's destruction at the hands of unknown forces. He and Kara leave to find out what caused Neo Palm to explode. Aron is half Orakian and half Layan a perfect mixture of sword attacks and useful techniques.AdanAdan: Adan is the main character IF Nial marries Laya. He is the prince of Mystoke, Landen, and Satera. Earthquakes start happening and Adan sets out with his sister Gwyn to discover their origin so he can put a stop to them. Much like Aron, Adan is half-Orakian and half-Layan so he's got a good mix of magical techniques and fighting skills.Gwyn: Gwyn is Adan's sister and she joins her brother on his quest to stop the mysterious earthquakes. She's also unique amongst the Phantasy Star III cast because she's also a clairvoyant and can see into the future through her dreams. She also has great healing techniques and is a crackshot marksman with her bow.Kara: Kara is Aron's cousin and the daughter of Lune. In the storylines of Sean and Crys, she's an embittered warrior who joins them because he father won't put up a fight to try and discover the true origins of the Orakian/Layan conflict. Even though she is a full-blooded Layan, she can't use techniques. She does have her father's legendary slicer though. In the storylines of Aron and Adan, however, she's a delicate woman who can both cast techniques and use a slicer in battle.MiunMiun: Miun is an ancient Mieu-type android, who along with Siren, fought with Orakio a thousand years ago. She is heavily damaged from an unknown battle and wanders aimlessly around the deserts of Aridia during the third generation. She's kept herself alive clinging to the desperate wish of seeing Orakio's face again. If she's approached by one of the third generation main characters with the sword in their possession, she will recognize it and shut down having her wish fulfilled. Mieu will take her legendary claw to use in future battles.Dark ForceDark Force: Yes, folks, he's back and he looks badder than ever. He's the ancient dark evil of legend who was trapped under the waters of Landen with Orakio's sword. The hero frees him when he recovers the sword, and must use it to destroy him before he destroys the world. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Some overworld enemies.Phantasy Star III followed the same basic mold as its predecessor and other early console RPGs. Players moved around the world from a top-down view, and the turn-based battles were first-person. Characters had various statistics which would improve after gaining experience points, and found items and equipment which would improve their abilities. Vehicles make their appearance in the late game, but most of the time the party will be walking through the seven worlds and crawling through lengthy dungeons to get between them or to uncover special items and progress the story.In the place of the traditional spells and magic were ""techniques"", which cost Technique Points (TP). Each character is able to cast techniques grouped by category (Order, Heal, Time, and Melee), consisting of 4 techniques each. An adjustable grid in shops lets the player change the relative strength and success rate of each spell in a group. So, for example, if they wanted an antidote spell (Anti) to succeed more often, they would adjust the grid so that more power is directed toward Anti, decreasing the power and success rate of the other 3 spells in its category (Heal). </div>  <div> Critical Reception : In the end, Phantasy Star III became most known for the game it wasn't. Fans of the series were looking for a direct continuation, and didn't get it. Critics were looking for the franchise to keep up its many top-notch characterstics, and didn't get that. New players to the series may have wanted a plot that had fewer confusing holes and edits, and they didn't get that either.Maps were barren even by 1990 standards.Previous games in the Phantasy Star series were noted for their vibrant colour, science-fiction atmosphere, detailed and well-animated enemies, and extensive character development. Phantasy Star III was perceived to have fallen short on nearly every front. The rushed development resulted in a game with a number of bugs, a lackluster English translation, game maps (towns, castles, dungeons, etc) with little to no decoration, uninspired dungeon design, barely animated enemies, and a learning curve that seemed to be more of a waterslide than a hill.Despite these extensive flaws, the game still had its attractions. The game's generation system got a lot of attention, and the characters and world design tantalizingly and frustratingly hinted at the depth left unable to shine by the game's many development constraints. The game's music, by Izuho Takeuchi (credited as ""Ippo""), at times haunting and medieval, at others driving and electric, was often mentioned as the game's best feature. Takeuchi would be the only team member to return for Phantasy Star IV. </div>  <div> Connections to Phantasy Star I and II : The seven linked worlds are actually separate, huge compartments of a spaceship, named the Alisa III - after the female protagonist of Phantasy Star I, Alis Landale. It's had a number of its systems go offline, and Rhys and his descendants work to repair it. But Phantasy Star III's real place in the universe's timeline only becomes apparent by visiting a skippable town in the game's third and final act.On the west side of Frigidia, one of the seven worlds, there is a town on an island accessible only by air, called New Mota. The people there are ""the keepers of our people's history"", they say (US release):We're the descendants of the people of Palm, a planet that once circled the distant star Algo. Palm was destroyed by an evil being that haunts us every 1,000 years, bringing death and ruin. This evil incarnate is known as Dark Force!The people of Palm were thinkers and creators. They knew of the plans made by the evil being. When the vile Dark Force stirred 1,000 years ago, preparations were made to escape from Palm. Our ancestors built a fleet of 400 spaceships.This armada escaped the destruction of Palm and set off into space to find a new homeland. Our ancestors thought they had at last escaped from the clutches of the undying master of evil. But Dark Force managed to slip aboard a ship. It destroyed all but one of our sister ships before Orakio and Laya trapped it on Alisa III. Now there are only two ships left of our fleet: our ship, the Alisa III, and the Neo Palm.The names Orakio and Laya echo down through the years...Palm, Mota, and Dezo ( Palma, Motavia and Dezoris in the original Japanese) were the names of the three planets in the Algo ( Algol) system that were the settings for Phantasy Star I and II. The destruction of Palm happens during PS II.Other references: The ""word of power"" in the game is "" Nei"", the name of a critically important character in Phantasy Star II. The Nei Weapons are inherited from the characters of PS II, though it's never explained how. </div>  <div> Trivia : Aron is the only one of Rhys' descendants to have his own unique walking sprite. The other descendants are just palette swaps of Lyle or Rhys' sprites.At the very start of the game, before Rhys goes and meets Maia at the marriage ceremony. He can sell his equipment at the shop and buy an escapipe. Once Maia gets kidnapped and Rhys gets imprisoned, he can use the escapipe to escape from the dungeon. Once doing this, the story is unable to progress and he can't leave town. The King says to him: ""You have used your escapipe! Normally a smart move, but now I'm afraid the game can't be continued. Please press RESET and try again."" Which is exactly what the player will have to do. </div> "

The planet                Motavia has been drastically changed from lush and full of life to a massive               desert. Magic has all but disappeared from world and day to day life is difficult. On top of this monsters have started appearing and the mysterious Zio is raising a strange cult.             Chaz Ashley is a young bounty hunter and partner to the famous             Alys Brangwin. Together they have been sent to investigate strange happenings in the basement of the Piata Academy. Little do they realize that they are beginning a journey that will not only pit them against the forces of Zio and his dark masters but will cross the reaches of space and time. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Boss Battle Against Dark ForcePhantasy Star IV is a very good example of the typical RPG of the 16-bit era. Characters join or leave the party as the story dictates, and are often replaced with new characters with similar or equally useful abilities. Each character has a set of abilities that is unlocked as they hit specific levels or storyline moments; these are broken down into two categories: Techniques and Skills.  TechniquesTechniques are essentially magic attacks that your characters can use by spending Technique Points (TP). These range from your standard elemental attacks (Foi, Wat, etc) to effects like            gravity (Nagra) or healing (Sar). Most characters have some magical ability, except for the android characters Demi and           Wren. </div>  <div> Presentation : Every character has a set of abilities called skills. Each skill has a fixed number of uses (that increases as you level up). Skills are only refreshed at save points and inns (or Alys' house) and are thus it's better to save them until you need them rather than wasting them to kill easier enemies. </div>  <div> Trivia : Some spells and abilities can combine to create devastating attacks. For example, if you cast Foi, Wat, and Tsu with three different characters (spells that only affect one enemy each) they will combine to form the spell Triblaster, a more powerful attack that will hit all enemies! There are several combo attacks in the game, and in many cases they involve mixing an elemental spell with a technique so that the elemental spell will hit all enemies. </div> "

The game was developed by SunSoft (SNES) and Illusions Gaming (Genesis) and published by Viacom New Media. Phantom 2040 was released in 1995 in Japan, North America, and Europe.The game is based off of the television series of the same name (itself a spin-off of Lee Falk's classic comic series The Phantom), with a story that is similar to that of the television show's, but not directly taken from it. Phantom 2040 is an action game that takes place in the city of Metropia. The Super Nintendo version holds an average rating of 68% on Game Rankings, while there are no reviews registered for the Genesis version. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Phantom 2040 shares similarities with games such as Super Metroid.The gameplay of Phantom 2040 is similar to many other 2D side-scrolling action games. It contains many aspects similar to such games as Super Metroid and Bionic Commando. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings). Some of these endings, however, aren't considered ""winning"" endings, and rather prompt the player to try again. </div>  <div> Plot : Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.It is the year 2040. The world is in a catastrophic state, due to environmental disasters. The Earth's ecological state hangs in the balance. Growing population and the deployment of robots called BIOTS (Biological Optical Transputer Systems) have caused the majority of people to scavenge for food, while the lucky few live in large, towering mansions.New York City has been renamed Metropia, and is the world's largest and most powerful city. Metropia houses the world's most powerful organization: Maximum, inc.. In addition to being the producer of BIOTS, Maximum holds high political standing due to their bribery of many leaders. Due to this influence, Maximum has transformed Metropia into a technologically-advanced city devoid of any animal or plant life. The insane leader of Maximum, Rebecca Madison, is intent on building a fortress called Cyberville where the wealthy can reside, safe from everything.Kit Walker is a Phantom (the 24th Phantom, in fact). The Phantoms work to restore order to the world, bringing an end to corruption, greed, and the violence that plagues the world. Kit Walker must now defeat Rebecca Madison to stop her from getting her ultimate goal of world domination. </div> "

Danyon Carpenter wrote, ""I was surprised by how good this game actually was. Although the character may not be the most modern around, Pink Panther still offers fans of side-scrolling action games some new surprises and a lot of technique. The idea of having movie sets for stages was cool and the music that goes with it is fitting. I would like to have seen more power-ups available, but as it stands, the game is decent"".In the same issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Mike Weigand reviewed the SNES version of the game giving it a 6 out of ten. He wrote, ""The cool pink cat makes it to the home systems!

It is also the first fighting game to incorporate real-life actors for the game's characters (through blue-screen digital processing), a technique later becoming popular due to the Mortal Kombat series.Up to three players fight their way through an underground fighting circuit as either ex-pro wrestler Buzz, kickboxer Ty, or karate black belt Kato. Unlike other fighting games of the type, the game focuses primarily on co-operative play (rather than a free-for-all, where only one player can remain standing) similar to other brawlers, as more enemies are fought simultaneously when more players are playing.The game is known for its ports of varying quality throughout 1991 and 1992 for numerous platforms, including the Sega Genesis (the only port with a Japanese release), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published by THQ), Game Boy (also published by THQ), and Atari Lynx. Tengen, Atari Games's home brand, was the publisher for the Genesis version and the developer for the SNES, Game Boy, and Lynx versions. The game was also ported to various computer-based systems in Europe (the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, PC, and ZX Spectrum), all of which were published by Domark.The original arcade version of the game was also included in various Midway compilations for sixth-to-seventh generation consoles, including the 2004 Midway Arcade Treasures 2, the 2006 Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition, the 2006 Japan-exclusive Game Center USA: Midway Arcade Treasures, and the 2012 Midway Arcade Origins. </div>  <div> Characters : Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO. </div> "

Populous,Bullfrog Productions,Electronic ArtsNA/PALSegaJP,December 1990,genesis,"Commonly cited as the founding title in the god game genre, Populous is a computer game from Bullfrog Productions in which the player is a deity that must help its followers become prosperous enough to overcoming rival deities and their followers.",3030-6210,6210,0,1989-01-01,https://www.giantbomb.com/populous/3030-6210/,," <div> Overview : Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover ArtAside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black & White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of ""retaining the feel"" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit. </div> "

It builds on Populous, borrowing elements but adding a whole lot more besides, including a 3D map that can be rotated around to an extent and an ""artificial life"" engine that allows for complex AI behavior that occurs naturally with little amounts of input from the player.It was released on many European and Japanese home computers, as well as on the SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD consoles in multiple regions.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game features a 3D game map, although camera movement was limited to rotating the map in 90-degree intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map itself is three dimensional, people, trees and other game objects where comprised of sprites. The game also features a fairly advanced ""artificial life"" engine. Each person seem to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. On death, citizens and soldiers alike would rise heavenwards in angelic form. The player also have a query tool that can be used to see the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment for any given person they click on. While the player cannot form the land, their actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example if the player deforests a big area the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on season) will fall, making movement slower.The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under their control. To win the map they need to tip the balance of power completely to their side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and kill any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, they can draft the locals into their army and take on bigger towns or enemy armies. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle and the player conquers the town they come under their command as well. The player can only control as many armies as they have captains so it's important to keep them alive - if a captain is killed his army is disbanded and his surviving solders go back to their town of origin. Unlike the main army which the main character commands, the subordinate captains have a ""lag"" time. The further away from the main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. When issuing orders via the captains, a useful and sometimes amusing feedback is provided: the affirmative voice sample is played at a pitch that signals the wisdom of the player's commands.Food is the single most important resource in the game, the expression ""an army marches on its belly"" is very true in Power Monger, therefore it is often smart to not to draft a whole town's population into an army, because an empty town will not produce food (or more people). Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep (by ordering the army to attack it), barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make stuff, but to speed things up the player can order an army to ""invent"" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive) the player's men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance. </div> "

Primal Rage,Probe Entertainment,Time Warner Interactive,"August 25, 1995",genesis,Giant beasts from different parts of the post-apocalyptic world fight each other for global domination in this violent 2D fighting game from Atari.,3030-14078,14078,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/primal-rage/3030-14078/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : Primal Rage is a 2D kaiju-themed fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994.Players control one of seven giant beasts and must fight to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known as ""Urth""). Like the large bosses in the early Mortal Kombat games (and the dinosaurs of Taito's Dino Rex), all beasts are rendered with stop-motion animation as model figures (while the small human followers are digitized actors). The game features numerous blood effects, including an end-of-round fatality system.Along with major arcade revisions (adding new special moves and abilities), the game received numerous ports for home consoles and handhelds in 1995. Other than the SNES version (which was ported by Bitmasters) and the PC version (which was ported by Teeny Weeny), all ports were done by Probe. They were released in North America and Europe by Time Warner Interactive for the Sony PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Sega 32X, Game Boy, Game Gear, Jaguar CD (exclusively in North America), 3DO (exclusively in North America), Amiga (exclusively in Europe for ECS and AGA systems), and PC (released for MS-DOS in CD-ROM format). It was also released in Japan for the PS1 (on December 13, 1996 by Time Warner Interactive) and Saturn (on February 26, 1998 by GameBank).Along with a short-lived toyline, it also received a four-issue comic book mini-series years after the game's original release. A sequel named Primal Rage II was in development in 1996, adding a new assortment of giant playable human ""Avatars"" (also rendered from model figures) to fight alongside the beasts. Although this sequel was canceled prior to release, some prototype boards from public tests (along with official cabinet artwork) of the sequel have been found, one of which is publically playable. Despite its cancellation, both games received an overarching novelization in 1997 (titled Primal Rage: The Avatars). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Glorified execution moves, known as Fatalities, can also be performed this way at the end of the winning round. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground, giving back some of their vitality. Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final endurance round to keep their place as ""king of the hill"". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish ""dinosaur graveyard"", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, they can immediately restore their character's initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues. </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes seven playable beasts (six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions). A final boss beast was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped and turned into an endurance match against the entire roster.Sauron and Blizzard are palette swaps of Diablo and Chaos. However, both Diablo and Chaos are smaller in size. Sauron (God of Hunger) Talon (God of Survival) Vertigo (Goddess of Insanity, unavailable in the GB and GG versions) Blizzard (God of Virtue) Chaos (God of Decay) Armadon (God of Life) Diablo (God of Destruction) </div> "

Rather than continue the tale of the last trilogy, Ubisoft decided to create a new world with all new characters. Prince of Persia introduces new gameplay elements and a fresh graphical style to the series. Prince of Persia was released on December 2, 2008 in the US.This game was created by Ubisoft Montreal, using the same core team that worked on Prince of Persia: Sands of Time. This game is not a continuation of the Sands of Time trilogy, but rather the start of a new trilogy with a new Prince and a new world. The game runs on a updated version of the Scimitar Engine created for Assassin's Creed, which allows the game to be non-linear, yet still allow the Prince to traverse the land with his usual acrobatic prowess. </div>  <div> Story : The Prince and ElikaThe adventure begins with a new Prince of Persia, a wanderer, who is returning home from an adventure on a donkey named Farah with a king's treasure in gold, which he earned on his previous venture. Not yet the Prince to be, he desires nothing more then to spend his treasure on many luxuries, including women and liquor, and carpets very thick.However quite suddenly, he is caught in a fierce sandstorm and is blown away. When the sandstorm subsides, he finds himself in a mythical garden of beauty, dominated at its center by a massive Tree of Life. The Prince and a girl, Elika, find each other, and, in the same predicament, decide to help each other. Together, they venture to the center of this grand oasis. When they arrive at the center, they witness the destruction of the tree, and the freedom of Ahriman, the ancient god of darkness. After being set free, Ahriman starts destroying the Tree of Light and the land is full with darkness and evil. The Prince, with the aid of Elika and her new found magic, take up arms against Ahriman's corruption, in an attempt to drive it back and cleanse the world with light once again.With Elika's help the Prince travels to the four different locations: the Citadel, the City of Light, the Royal Palace, and the Vale to vanquish each of the four bosses. Once each boss is defeated the duo travel back to the temple to make sure Ahriman is sealed in the Tree of Light. When they get there they are confronted by Elika's father, the King, who attempts to stop them one last time. Upon defeat the King leaps into an abyss towards the Tree of Light. A second later Ahriman rises up in the form of a dragon monster and tries to kill the Prince and Elika. From the viewpoint of Ahriman you must travel around the room and heal the remaining areas surrounding the Tree. Once this is done Ahriman is captured back in the Tree, and Elika collapses. The Prince realizes that Elika has died, he understands now that Elika is giving bits of her life to heal all of the lands throughout the game. He now realizes that Elika's father only realized Ahriman so that Elika could live, it seems one cannot live without the other. The Prince lays her down outside the temple and travels back to the beginning of each area. In front of each of the four area's is a tree similar to the Tree of Light. The prince cuts down all four trees and travels back to the Tree of Light in the temple.One final blow and he cuts down the tree of light that you worked so hard to restore throughout the game, releasing Ahriman back into the world as the King had previously done. The Prince carries the huge ball of light to where Elika is at the front of the temple and places it over her. Elika then comes back to life. The final scene shows the prince walking away from the temple with Elika in his arms, as Ahriman in his full demon form flies overhead and out of the scene, released into the world once more. The final trophy/achievement for the game is awarded at this point, it is titled ""To Be Continued."" </div>  <div> Gameplay : Healing the lands with light again.The Prince is able to traverse the land, with what has now become the standard arsenal of moves for him. He is able to wall-run, leap from wall to wall, swing on poles, and of course jump and hang from ledges.New to this game however are the inclusion of the Prince's claws called the Gauntlet, which are a sort of glove he wears on his left hand which can smash into walls and save him from falling, though neither battle wounds nor falling end up in Prince's death due to help of his companion Elika, who will save him whenever he is in danger. By using the Gauntlet he is able to slide down walls and even block attacks. The game also features a healthy smattering of environmental puzzles which the Prince can solve with help from his new friend Elika who aids him on his adventure, both in combat and adventure.Unlike other titles, the Prince will not collect new equipment to aid him in his journey. There is no special armor or gauntlet to collect in the game. The sword the Prince begins with is the one which he wields until the end, in an effort to make it a memorable weapon. Players will, however, gain new magical powers which Elika will use. Once the player has collected enough Light Seeds, they can be traded in at the temple for the player's ability of choice. These light seeds appear throughout every level once it has been cleansed, and many are challenging to obtain. The abilities which can be unlocked will allow the player to access new areas once inaccessible, as well as grab light seeds once unobtainable.The Hunter attacking the Prince and Elika.In the previous trilogy of games, the Prince utilized the Sands of Time in order to rewind time and fix any mistakes he had made. In this Prince of Persia, there are no Sands of Time, rather, Elika will help the Prince to jump higher and farther. Elika proves to be an excellent help throughout the game, and has been designed to help rather then hinder the Prince's success.Prince of Persia contains light puzzle elements, with one or two puzzles in each of the game's zones. The puzzles involve lever pulling, whether to put walls in place, or open floodgates. The puzzles are meant to add variety to the game which is heavy on platforming.Combat has also been changed, with a focus on one-on-two: the Prince and Elika versus an enemy. Elika is able to perform combos seamlessly with the Prince. The design philosophy driving the new combat system is to make each battle both more intense and cinematic. Fights are not as common as they were in the previous games, but aim to keep the player on the edge of their seat using intense, cinematic imagery.In tradition of the other Prince of Persia's, the game has great acrobatics.The combat system assigns attacks to four main buttons. Elika, the Prince's sword, and the gauntlet are all assigned to their own button, as well as one button reserved for 'acrobatic' attacks. The player can initiate a combo with any of the four choices, then continue with another. Both timing and attack selection are key to creating larger combos. If the player hesitates, they miss the opportunity to attack. Visual cues in the on screen action will make the player aware of the attack they should next perform on some occasions, and any other attempts will end the combo. These are usually reserved for combo finishers, however, as the first few choices are generally up to the player.The Prince can also block attacks and counter blows. Holding the block button will guard most attacks, but pressing it strategically will create an opportunity to counter. The player must beware, however, as enemies can also counter. The combat system also employs quick time events at various times throughout a battle. The player will need to repeatedly press buttons to push the enemy away or quickly press a prompted button to avoid a final blow. Throughout the game, the player will encounter a variety of enemies which require creative thinking to take down, such as The Warrior, who cannot be harmed by the sword, gauntlet, or magic. </div>  <div> Development : Prince of Persia's development team began conception right as Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones was released, however, tangible proof of the game was found when, on September 21, 2006 a leaked concept art hit the net. Ubisoft remained silent and made no comment. On January 23, 2008 some more screen shots from the game were leaked onto the internet, while the game was in it's conception phase. Once again, Ubisoft did not comment.In May 2008, Ubisoft finally released two videos of a concept artist designing the Prince and Elika confirming the existence of the game officially under the Prince of Persia title. One video shows a full-bodied new Prince being speed drawn using Photoshop. The other art drawing video detailed Elika and finally the third speed concept art emerged in July, 2008, this time depicting a prime enemy; The Hunter. Those videos may be seen here and here. </div>  <div> Downloadable Content : The Shapeshifter, relaxing at home.The Prince of Persia Epilogue content appeared the PS3 and Xbox 360 on February 26. It continues the story of the retail game, increases the difficulty, adds a new power for Elika and attack for the Prince, reveals a brand new location, and includes two unlockable skins that become available after completing the Epilogue.Jamal Rguigui has said that the Ubisoft Montreal team decided to go on ahead full throttle with some cool ideas that the team had during and post-production and developed a unique DLC that would enhance the experience for Prince of Persia fans. It was not content that was cut, but was content that was further polished and elaborated on. He continued to say that they had a lot of ambitions for the DLC and that they were filtering all the feedback from the industry and the community of gamers. Players can expect to have a specific experience that will give them more content with superior difficulty and pace. This is one of the most ambitious DLC projects from Ubisoft, and it adds to the understanding of Prince of Persia's new world and characters.New powers away!Elika will be receiving a new power that is called Energize which is a travel based power that adds a timing challenge. This power allows Elika, for a short period of time, to materialize an area of the environment that was previously destroyed. Therefore, the Prince and Elika will be able to access areas previously impossible to reach without this power. There is also a new enemy in the form of the Shapeshifter which is an enemy that takes the form of two of Ahriman's most fearsome Lieutenants, the Warrior and the Hunter. Though their physical form is familiar to our heroes and the player, it will requires a particular strategy to defeat the Shapeshifter, rewarding the player that takes advantage of the new sprint feature exclusive to the Epilogue. As mentioned the content will also include a feature called sprint clashing. When the Prince and the enemy are at a distance, the player can mash the acrobatics button, which will allow the enemy and the Prince to sprint at each other and attack. The new area is called the Underground Palace and it is completely corrupted. Ubisoft has listened to the feedback and upped the pace of the game with more aggressive A.I and more complex traps. The content will also have new Trophies and Achievements.It is not necessary to have finished the Prince of Persia game to play the DLC. This content is available both Xbox 360 and PS3 on March 5 for 800 MS points and $10 respectively. </div>  <div> Areas : Prince of Persia is divided into four different areas, each of which has its own visual style. Each zone is divided into six areas: one introductory area, four main Fertile Ground areas, and one final area behind a black gate.To reach the final area, the player must first heal all fertile grounds in the zone. Players can progress through each area as they choose, but are limited to the power they posses. Initially, all introductory fertile grounds must be healed to progress. Once the player chooses a power, however, they can choose which power they want, and Elika will inform the player which areas are accessible with each power. Each power will open up four areas in two zones each. The Prince can freely travel between each level with no load times as each is connected.The areas are as follows: </div>  <div> Bosses : The Hunter, who stalks his prey in The CitadelThe long abandoned guard post of the city, the Citadel is currently where The Hunter resides. </div>  <div> Music : The Warrior, who rules over the City of LightThe City of Light was once a place of wonders, but once it came into The Warrior's hands, it is now a place of destruction. The city was once a place where travellers would come to trade, scholars would gather to learn, and filled with beauty and life. </div>  <div> Limited Edition Offer : The Concubine, who resides in the Royal PalaceIn the Royal Palace, The Prince will encounter The Concubine. The Royal Palace contains a cavern, the Royal Gardens, the Royal Spire, the Spire of Dreams, the Coronation Chamber, and the Palace rooms. The Royal Palace is an area which holds many memories for Elika, and many important areas for the kingdom. The Royal Spire serves as the seat of power in the land, and was where Elika's father sat on his throne, and the hall of coronation, where the king receives his crown. The king and queen were wed in the Spire of Dreams, a place that was said to make one's dreams come true. Once upon a time, the Royal Palace was a place of wonder. Actors filled the cavern, and the lush gardens were truly a sight to behold. After Elika's mother died, the Royal Palace began to lose beauty. The gardens withered away along with the king's sanity, and the Royal Palace is now merely a fraction of its former glory. </div>  <div> Alternate Skins : The Alchemist, who resides in The ValeThe Alchemist claims the Vale as his home, dwelling within the Observatory, where he brings terror to The Vale. The Vale is characterized by many different, wondrous machines, which the Alchemist invented when Ahriman was free. </div>  <div> Penny Arcade Story Book : The HunterThe Hunter was once a prince, who lived only for the hunt. He would travel lands, far and wide in an attempt to face off against the most exotic and powerful beasts. After a certain amount of time had passed, and a certain amount of animals had been slain, the Hunter felt that there was no longer any creature alive that would give him the thrill of the chase. This is when Ahriman's voice crept in and offered him a solution to his dilemma. The Hunter was to offer his soul to Ahriman, and in exchange would be allowed to hunt for all eternity, the one creature that could pose any sort of challenge: man. </div>  <div> System Requirements : The Concubine used to be a beautiful women, who had the ability to trick any man she wanted into doing whatever she desired. She used her beauty and gift and became political. One day however she fell in love with a handsome noble man, and they were to be married. However a jealous women, came and attacked her, disfiguring her, and her face. With no way to return to her former beauty, the Concubine fled, and sold her soul to Ahriman, and exchange, she would have the ability to control all men. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The WarriorOnce a King of a great nation, the Warrior was forced into becoming a corrupted being. His kingdom was facing great problems and were constantly at war, and so Ahriman came to the Warrior and offered him great power in exchange for his soul and servitude. To protect his people, the Warrior accepted, and he was suddenly transformed into a great and powerful being. However when his enemies were defeated his people were scared and shunned him, and he realized that he had become the very thing he had fought. Thus, to protect his people and fulfil his duty, he left and became a warrior at Ahriman's side. </div> "

However, many of the levels involve puzzles which are required in order to progress.Puggsy uses Total Object Interaction which is the system that allows real world physics to come into play. Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you. If you're crafty, you can bring multiple things in the doorway with you, netting you those precious extra points. You can also replay any levels that you like, which is helpful if you need points or a pair of sunglasses or trainers for Puggsy. </div>  <div> Special Items : Sunglasses - Not only used to look awesome, they act as a shield for one hit.Shield - Makes you temporarily invincible when activated.Trainers - When worn, provides a speed and jump height boost.

After his entire family was murdered by the mafia, Frank Castle decides to devote his life to make sure that criminals get what they deserve. Players take control of The Punisher as he tracks criminals down through the criminal underworld. Some of the criminals you will be fighting include members of the Eternal Sun (think Yakuza) and of course the Russians.The game also features several cameos from other characters in the Marvel Comics universe including Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and Matt Murdock (aka Daredevil).The game originally received an Adult Only rating from the ESRB due to the level of violence in some of the environmental kills. The developers changed camera angles to avoid letting the player see the full kill. This also allowed them to get a Mature rating. It is possible to return the Xbox and PC versions of the game to their original state via a small modification which significantly enhances the level of violence. </div>  <div> Story : The Punisher opens with Frank Castle (The Punisher) being interrogated by Detective Soap and Detective Richtofen in Ryker's Island maximum security prison. Soap and Richtofen begin questioning Castle about his actions over the past three weeks which have all led up to this point.Frank Castle, The PunisherThe story then flashes back to three weeks previous when the player takes control of The Punisher, who proceeds clear out a crackhouse full of criminals. This eventually leads to Castle going to war against the local criminal organizations, namely an Italian family mob called the Gnucci's, a group of Russian mercenaries and the Japanese Eternal Sun Yakuza gang.Over the duration of the game, the story switches between the past events and the current interrogation leading to a culmination of both. </div>  <div> Levels : CrackhouseThe Chop ShopLucky's BarCentral ZooGrey's Funeral HomeGnucci EstatePier 74The Igor BaltiyskyCastle's ApartmentGrand Nixon IslandFisk IndustriesPier 74 RevisitedMeat Packing PlantStark TowersThe Takagi BuildingRyker's Island </div>  <div> Gameplay : The Punisher is a mixture of third-person shooting and interrogation mini games, with an over arcing Tony Hawk style point accumulation system tying both together.Interrogation can be a shaky business.Much like The Club, the player is awarded points for each gang member/criminal they kill. The player is also awarded bonus points for successfully interrogating said criminals through a variety of means. There are also special ""kill spots"" within some levels that, when triggered, kills an enemy instantly, usually in a gory fashion.At any time in a level The Punisher can grab an enemy and interrogate them to see if they have any useful information. The basic interrogation techniques take the form of ""gun tension"", "" punch"", ""face smash"" and ""choke"" which involve: threatening to shoot the interrogation victim in the face; punching them repeatedly; smashing their face against the floor (much in the style of a curb stomp) or strangling them with Castle's bare hands, etc.More advanced interrogation techniques are available within a level based on the surroundings and are indicated to the player by a white floating skull. Players first have to grab an enemy and move over to the the skull to begin the interrogation. When finished, the player can decide to pull the enemy out of the interrogation object/action or conversely push the interrogation object/action meter too far, causing the enemy to die.To unlock bonus content and new levels, The Punisher sets out a series of medals that have to be achieved within each level of the game by reaching a predefined score. The bronze, silver and gold medals are multiples of each other with the higher scores usually requiring more tactics to avoid taking damage and hence losing the current point combo.In addition to the medals, The Punisher also has a challenge mode in which the player replays a scene from a specific level and must complete the challenge ascribed to them. This can involve completing the scene without taking damage or completing the level within a set amount of time etc.If you have a modified Xbox either via soft mod or modchip you can modify the game and return it to its original state. There are many kill in the game that were censored so they wouldn't get an AO rating. The modification allows you to see the kills as intended by the developer and they are far more violent and gory. You can so modify the pc version to revert the games kills to their original state. Unfortunately there is no way to modify the PS2 version. </div>  <div> Characters : Throughout The Punisher you fight a wide variety of enemies. From simple thugs and drug dealers on the street, to the Powerful Russian Mercs. or the Eternal Sun Gang. </div>  <div> Weapons : Detective Martin Soap - A good cop who has had some bad luck.

Much of the game is heavily influenced by the Indiana Jones film series.As an archeological adventurer, Donald can stun his enemies using a handgun that fires an endless supply of plungers. Throughout the game, he can upgrade his weapon (allowing him to climb on his plungers and hang-on to certain birds) and obtain different types of ammunition (popcorn and bubble gum). Much of the main non-dungeon levels can be completed non-linearly in any order, which creates points for the player to fast-travel (using a biplane piloted by his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie).Both this game and Castle of Illusion later received a successor as World of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, and were also bundled together as both a 1996 European Sega Mega Drive compilation (The Disney Collection) and a 1998 Japanese Sega Saturn compilation (Sega Ages: I Love Mickey Mouse: Fushigi no Oshiro Daibouken / I Love Donald Duck: Guruzia-ou no Hihou). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Each level sees Donald Duck going from left to right like most 2D side-scrollers. Along the way are enemies like the underlings of Pete, birds, living statues and even cacti. Most levels have an overworld and a dungeon: these dungeons consist of puzzles and traps, but have a big reward at the end. The first the levels have upgrades for weapons while later levels have clues - like scrolls, jewels or keys - all of which are needed to find the location of King Garuzia's treasure.Donald is equipped with a plunger gun. This has an unlimited supply of yellow plungers, which are used to stun enemies so Donald can walk past them. In Mexico, Goofy gives Donald the red plungers and these can stick to wall for a limited time and can be used to get to unreachable places. Lastly, the Viking Captain gives Donald the green plunger which can be attached to birds; holding onto them will bring Donald along for the ride. Donald is also equipped with another gun with limited ammo and this gun fires popcorn and bubble gum. He can find pieces of corn and gum to refill this weapon. Enemies hit with either will be permanently defeated, rather than just stunned temporarily.Along the way are different types of food, like burgers and chicken, and these give Donald health. Hats can be found to give Donald a 1-up. Finally, if Donald eats five chili peppers, he will get mad and become invulnerable for a short period. During this time he will move faster and jump higher and wipe out any enemy he comes in contact with. </div>  <div> Plot : While Donald is looking through Scrooge McDuck's books, an old piece of paper slips out of one of them. Donald discovers that it is a map that leads to King Garuzia's greatest treasure. Donald is overjoyed and with the help of his three nephews he starts his quest for the legendary treasure.Unfortunately, Big Bad Pete overheard Donald's plan and is trying to stop Donald and get the treasure for himself. He sets his minions on Donald and later steals the necessary clues for the treasure's location in exchange for his kidnapped nephews.Throughout the game Donald must travel between several locations to get new weapons and to get parts of the treasure so he can advance further. This involves setting waypoints that allows his nephews to pick him up in their plane, and later returning to the set waypoint once the correct item has been found. </div>  <div> Ending : In the end, Donald manages to defeat Pete and get the treasure for himself, however it turns out to be a stone statue. Donald returns home crestfallen, worried about how his girlfriend Daisy will react, until his nephews accidentally break the statue while unloading it from the plane and reveal a priceless gold and jewel necklace within. Donald gives the necklace to Daisy Duck and they fly away into the sunset. </div> "

Played from a top-down perspective in-level, with over-the-shoulder perspective boss fights between levels, Rambo uses his AK-47, blocks of C-4, explosive tipped arrows and, of course, his enormous K-BAR knife to fight his way in and out of the 6 levels in the game.The game also had Rambo accomplishing a variety of mission objectives, including rescuing prisoners, taking out Soviet supplies, and shooting down HIND helicopters with explosive arrows. Some game mechanics included item refills though the use of the combat knife - enemies dispatched with the knife usually leave behind items. This exposed Rambo to additional danger however, since the game employed a one-hit-wonder health system, forcing the player to weigh the risks and rewards of going after those items. </div>  <div> SMS Version : The Sega Master System version of Rambo III is a light-gun game, rather than the top-down shooter found on other systems. Though more similar mechanically to the ""behind-the-shoulder"" TPS Arcade version, very little of the game appears to have anything to do with the plot of Rambo III, as the generic enemies look nothing like Soviet soldiers. It's possible the game was at one point a generic light gun game and had the Rambo III license bolted onto it late during its development. </div> "

Jiro will also have magic at his disposal to slay the endless waves of enemy ninjas. Jiro can jump, double jump and wall jump as well as use a grappling hook. The only thing he can't do is block. Instead of blocking, the player will have to parry enemy attacks. The game has a dedicated parry button that the player will have to hit at just the right moment to counter an attack. Different attacks have different timings and parrying can be done on the ground and in the air.Shinobi has a multiplier system where players are rewarded for killing the maximum amount of enemies without getting hit. As the multiplier rises, Jiro's sword will begin to glow. Combos are executed by mixing different kinds of katana strikes (sweeping strikes and stabs) while throwing ninja stars at far away enemies. Said stars can be thrown in waves to eliminate a maximum amount of enemies. To reward skillful play, Griptonite Games have incorporated an in game achievement system that unlock special features and cheats, similar to the in-game achievements found in the console versions of After Burner Climax. </div> "

The game has also been featured in numerous Sega game compilations, including  Sonic Mega Collection,  Sonic Mega Collection Plus,  Sega Genesis Collection, and  Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection. The game stars the eponymous  Ristar, who must travel the galaxy and rescue his father while stopping Greedy, an evil alien tyrant who has enslaved the population and brainwashed the planet's leaders. The game was composed by  Tomoko Sasaki, who would continue to work with Sonic Team in the future.Ristar was created from early concept designs of the original  Sonic the Hedgehog. The idea of Ristar's extending arms was taken from a rabbit that would use its ears to grab enemies.  The rabbit was originally known as Feels.  Feels the Rabbit, in concept, was alleged to be the mascot for SEGA to go against Mario and Nintendo in a marketing fashion.  Allegedly, higher ranking officials at SEGA did not think that Feels was cutting edge and fast enough to compete.  The ideas behind Feels and his stretchy ears, which would eventually become Ristar's trademark stretchy arms, were put on the back burner for what would become Sonic.  Feels eventually continued development, in which he was changed to a star by the name of Dexstar.  Dexstar would change names a few times until the name of Ristar was finally settled upon after development.  Ristar would eventually be released on February 15, 1995 in Europe, February 16, 1995 in the US, and February 17, 1995 in Japan. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ristar's unique gameplay revolves around the use of the character's long, extending arms. Unlike other platformers, the player cannot defeat enemies by jumping on them, so the player must grab enemies and crash into them. The player must also use these arms to interact with the environment, such as climbing ladders, swinging from poles or knocking over trees. The player can also use his arms to reach areas directly above or below him. Like other platformers, the mechanics get increasingly difficult and the player must master the use of Ristar's arms if they are to complete the game. Another unique device in Ristar are cranks. Located throughout the stages, they can be grabbed, which spins Ristar until the player lets go. Using timing, the player can fly off in their desired direction to reach platforms, or to crash into enemies.The player's health is indicated by stars, which can be replenished throughout the level, located in chests. Yellow stars grant one point of health, while blue stars restore all health. Players can restore extra lives through pickups in the form of Ristar statues, or by gaining 20,000 points. Points are gained by defeating enemies, or through collectible gems.Gameplay in the Game Gear version is mostly identical, but features additional levels as well as a number of changes to original ones. Also included are stars that are scattered throughout the levels, which grant the player an extra life upon collecting 100, much like  coins in  Super Mario.The game is split up into 7 worlds, each two stages in length, as well as a final boss-only world. The first stage contains a mini-boss, while the second stage contains a main boss. Each stage also contains a bonus stage, which involve reaching a chest in a certain amount of time. If the player reaches the chest in less than a minute, they earn an extra life. If the player completes enough bonus levels, they will be awarded with  passwords upon completion of the game. </div>  <div> Worlds : Planet Flora: The typical Sonic Team first world: A vegetated forest which introduces the game's mechanics.Planet Undertow: A dry desert, containing the game's underwater levels.Planet Scorch: An industrial planet with volcanoes.

It is, at its core, a side-scrolling platformer, with the added twist of being able to fly in any direction thanks to the main character's jet pack. Though it could be classified as a cult hit, Rocket Knight Adventures is considered a classic platformer for the Genesis due to its tight controls, colorful art direction, and inventive gameplay. </div>  <div> Plot : It's Sparkster!The game centers around Sparkster, leader of the Rocket Knights of Zebulos. These Rocket Knights were formed to prevent enemies from getting their hands on the 'Key To The Seal'. This key gains the holder the ability to use a massive ship known as Pig Star, which has the potential to destory all life as we know it. Pig Star was used to attack Zebulos, but the invaders were defeated and the ship impounded.A faction using gigantic robots and a hella-lot of people are invading the Kingdom of Zebulos to try and get their hands on the Key To The Seal. Sparkster heads to the Castle and finds that the Princess has been kidnapped, hopefully to be used as a bargaining chip to gain the Key To The Seal, and then the Pig Star itself! </div>  <div> Gameplay : Rocket Knight AdventuresRocket Knight Adventures is primarily a 2D platformer, but there are levels in the game that more closely resemble side-scrolling shooters, like Gradius. In the platforming levels, Sparkster can swing his sword, which shoots out short-ranged projectiles, jump, or rocket forward using his jetpack. With the jetpack dash, Sparkster can fly in eight different directions, and will bounce off of surfaces that he hits at an angle. In the shooter levels, Sparkster dons his trusty eyegoggles and rockets forward at incredible speeds, using his sword to take down any enemies that get in his path.One aspect of Rocket Knight Adventures which sets it above the majority of platformers of its generation was that in each progressive level the gameplay dynamic would change in some way, rather than merely recylcing the same levels and adding more enemies. While some levels scrolled horizontally, others scrolled vertically. In some levels, Sparkster would ride a vehicle of some kind, like a mine cart or a pair of robotic legs, and have to dodge inbound enemies and obstacles. </div>  <div> Appearances Outside the Franchise : Sparkster had a cameo in the Sega/Mega CD version of Snatcher, appearing in Outer Heaven alongside several other Konami characters.The UK-based ""Sonic the Comic"" (AKA ""Fleetway"") produced a series of comic adaptations based on Rocket Knight Adventures.Sparkster appears in a hidden ending in Contra: Shattered Soldier as a shadowy figure attacking Bill and Lance </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded their ""Editor's Gold Choice"" award along with scores of 8,8,8,8 and 8 out of ten.

The game is known for its use of fighting game mechanics (including the ability to jump and the ability to perform special moves).The game includes two game modes chosen from the start: Single Match mode (which uses traditional one-on-one matches) and Team Battle Royale mode (which uses two-on-two tornado-tag matches, where all wrestlers fight simultaneously). Arcade cabinets that support four players (or two linked-up two-player cabinets) can play four-player Team Battle Royale matches.Saturday Night Slam Masters was ported to the FM Towns Marty (in Japan only) on November 1993, and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis throughout 1994. While the SNES version was the only version to include Team Battle Royale mode (which can be played in four-player thanks to multitap accessories), the Genesis version includes an exclusive Death Match mode, which grants more weapons to use, covers the ropes with barbed wire and proximity explosives (making it impossible to bounce off the ropes, but allows players to damage their opponents by throwing them at the ropes), and lays land mines outside the arena.An updated version of the arcade release (titled Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle in the international version and Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors in the Japanese version) was released on December 1993, removing Single Match mode entirely while refining the grappling mechanics, adding new moves for all characters, and allowing players to select the same character.

Wrestlers can also run against the ropes of the ring, creating a new set of running attacks. Each wrestler featured has one unique special move as well as a finisher they can perform from the grapple once they had depleted their opponents health bar low enough. Once the opponent's health bar is either completely empty, or close to empty, the wrestler can attempt a pin to win or use a submission move to make their opponent quit. Matches can also end with a 20-count ring out.The game features two play modes: Single Match, which featured traditional one-on-one wrestling matches, and Team Battle Royale, which featured two-on-two elimination style matches. In Team Battle Royale, both members of a team have to be pinned or submit for the other team to win. Players could either form a cooperative team, or a single player could have a CPU controlled partner. If playing Team Battle Royale in single player, the match ends in a ""No Contest"" if the player character is pinned and his CPU controlled partner is not.The game also features the ability to leave the ring. Various weapons can be found that allow a wrestler to greatly damage their opponent.

Yamato is made Musashi's pet dog after the original owner dies and the two seek vengeance.Another distinction between the Genesis version and the Arcade version is that there is a meter that is filled by holding the attack button; upon release Yamato will attack the nearest enemy so long as he is barking, allowing for much more versatility in its usage than in the original.Though exclusive to the Genesis for a long time, the game eventually became available on the PC/PS2/PSP (as part of the Sega Genesis Collection) and the Wii's Virtual Console. </div>  <div> Yamato : After bringing down the Neo Zeed organization.

Note: Achievements can only be earned in a game with at least 4 players on each team in either Public or Private Matches, online or LAN. Shadowrun does not support any split-screen play. </div>  <div> Races : Lineage ElfElves are the fastest race, but also the weakest. They are slowed substantially by heavy weapons and will quickly be killed from sustained fire. However, their speed compensates for this, as well as their ability to heal when not taking damage, after a few seconds and if they have essence available. Elves have the second greatest amount of essence. They are best suited for hit and run tactics, and players that are magic heavy. Elves are arguably the best rezzers because of their high essence count and ability to get in and out of areas quickly. Elves can swoop in, get the rez and get out of the fight, opposed to dwarves who usually have to stay and fight. Elf ninja is popular but only effective if played conservatively and intelligently. Always go for the bleed out because elves do very weak melee damage. Wired Reflexes is not suggested because it severely decreases your essence pool, teleport, smoke and gust are more suited for elves. Elves are the best artifact runners due to their speed.Lineage TrollTrolls are the slowest race, but the strongest. No weapon, no matter how heavy, will slow them down, and they can take an incredible amount of damage, especially with their special ability. When taking sustained fire, a troll will use its essence to harden his skin. This slows it down but allows it to take enormous amounts of damage. Trolls have the same essence as humans, but do not share their tech ability, so they are not great magic or tech users. When a troll is using a katana, they do double the damage of other races and can kill most enemies with two slices. Wired also only locks two essence slots for trolls so it is usually the best tech to use as troll to counter their slow speed. They are best suited for players who forfeit stealth and agility for brute force. Although trolls have the most health, they rely heavily on a tree because they need a lot of hit points their hardening to be effective. If a troll has half health or less they will die as quickly as the other races. So buy a tree first round every time you play troll. Trolls are also good artifact runners when within 30 meters, because they can use their health and hardening ability to charge through defenses to score the artifact.RNA DwarfDwarves are a slightly more specialized race than either the Trolls or the Elves. They are slightly faster than trolls and fairly strong, not being hampered much by heavier weapons. Dwarves can take a good deal of damage(but be warned, their round bodies perfectly fit into most guns reticules so they get hit by most of the shots fired) and as a bonus they can withstand a direct headshot from a sniper rifle(dwarves are not effected by the headshot modifier for weapons), which is fatal for any other race. This ability makes dwarves good counter-snipers/riflers. Their special ability is that they can steal essence from other players (friend or foe) and from magical objects like strangle and minions. However, dwarves regenerate essence very slowly when not draining from other sources, but have lots of essence at their disposal. In addition, dwarves are able to withstand a surprise attack from a katana and not bleed ou t. Dwarves are very tactical and are best played as a specialist race. Dwarves are suited both for magic specialization or tech use, but mixing magic and tech is not recommended. Dwarves are good companions for Trolls, because they have similar stats and uses.RNA HumanHumans are the middle ground of the races. They are the second fastest after elves and second most resilient after trolls. Humans have several small advantages that give them a unique play style. First, none of their essence is locked by tech, as it is with all other races. Second, they start the first round with an extra 500 dollars, which can be a huge advantage during the first few rounds. Humans are also quite versatile, they can do a bit of everything. Humans are the best suited for slaying and ranged combat (especially the rifle). Humans are best suited for recon with Enhanced Vision, as well as using Wired Reflexes, and Smartink. As with trolls and elves make sure teleport is one of your main abilities for most of your games.Players can purchase magic, tech, and weapons at the beginning of each round of play. At the beginning of the first round they have $2000, except humans who have $2500. Each new round adds $1400 for each player, plus money the player earns by helping his or her team during each match, whether through killing enemies, supporting friendlies(rez, healing with trees, assisting in kills), or focusing on the objective. Money can also be lost by team killing or damaging during the round. Rounds are either won by killing all enemies(all game modes), scoring the artifact, or defending artifact(in Raid). More money is earned when teams score the artifact in Extraction and Raid, or if the defenders defend the artifact by the rounds end in Raid, and finally, in Attrition the team who posesses the artifact at the end of the round will win and earn more money. Matches are a best of eleven series, first to six wins. </div>  <div> Levels : Area 1Waking UpGetting to know the placeMore of the PlaceThe CemeteryWhere will fate guide us?Area 2The Arena...How to get out of this dump...?More StuffTime to finish what we started.Before we do anything else...Area 3Get this out of my head!Rust StilettosKitsune, Cat WomanThe Insane JesterDark Blades, Drake's HandymenThe Mysterious Ship, BremertonInside the BremertonKill the Jester!Getting to DrakeIt's hot in here...Last Stop, Aneki... </div>  <div> Magic Options : Teleport ($2250): Enables users to instantly warp 8-10 meters in the direction of their movement, even through solid objects. Can be used in combination with the Glider tech to obtain maximum mobility. Three pips of essence per cast, one second buffer time. One of the most important abilities in the game. Countered by dwarves, Anti-Magic Generators and Gust.Resurrect ($2000): Allows a player to bind fallen teammates to their own life energy in order to bring them back to life. This also works to stop teammates from ""bleeding out"". When players are bound through resurrection, the caster must sacrifice some of their maximum essence. Four essence pips will be used for cast, then locked if successful. ""Karma"" can change these values to 3, 2 or 1 based on how many rounds your team is losing by. Players can also be rezzed multiple times in Karma rounds, and bodies take longer to clear in Karma rounds.Strangle ($2000): Produces a field of crystals which restricts the movement and drains the essence of any player caught amongst them. Does minimal damage, but can kill players with low health. Locks two essence slots while active as elf, troll, human and three for dwarves. Most effectively used by dwarves and elves. Countered by weapons fire, grenades, AMG's, and dwarves.Summon ($3000): Summons a creature which can either be ordered to defend an area, attacking all enemies nearby, or ordered to directly pursue an individual target, which it will relentlessly hunt until its destruction. Though powerful, summons are very weak to essence-draining magic and tech, and they will also abandon any orders in order to attack another summon, be it hostile or friendly. Minions attack with ther claws and can cause a lot of damage in close quarters. Effective against trolls, groups of enemies, and enemies who are bleeding out. Countered by weapons fire, grenades, AMG's, dwarves, other minions.Gust ($2000): A burst of powerful wind that can push enemies and objects away, and if timed carefully, can break a player's fall. Players hit by gust will find their accuracy lowered for a short period of time. In addition, gust is the only way to damage players using the Smoke magic. Gust can multiply the effectiveness of glider by gusting then activating glider (called Gust-Gliding). Very versatile magic rewards clever use. Common practice is gusting nades back to enemies or using gust to launch your own nade (poor-mans rocket launcher), gust bodies to rez or prevent multi-rez or push bodies off map, instantly clearing the body instantly. Only effective counter is essence drain, be it dwarves or AMG's (preventing cast).Smoke ($2000): Allows a player to turn their body to smoke, causing bullets, explosions, and falls to cause no damage, though being hit with Gust or the artifact will cause significant harm. Players with smoke mapped cannot be seen by Enhanced Vision (20 meters and above) and completely undetected when activated. While in smoke your essence will drain one pip at a time until deactivated or you run out of essence. Having smoke mapped also slows you essence regeneration rate by about 25%, for dwarves this completely stops their essence regen and can only gain essence with their ability. Countered by gust, AMG's, and dwarves. When deactivating smoke you cannot use your weapons, magic or tech for about 2 seconds, leaving you vulnerable.Tree of Life ($2000): Creates a tree that heals anyone nearby, as well as providing a physical barrier that can be used for cover. Lasts until it heals a certain amount of damage, or is destroyed by enemy fire. The closer you are to tree the faster you will heal. Will heal friend or foe alike, three pips per cast, 30 second buffer time. Countered by grenades and weapon fire, AMG's, strangle, and dwarves. </div>  <div> Tech Options : Grenade (Free with Spawn): Allows the player to throw grenades. The player starts with two, and can pick up and replace any used from dead enemies or teammates. Can instantly kill all but trolls within 3 meters of enemy (or friendly). Can also be used to knock enemies bodies off map.Enhanced Vision ($2000): Allows the player to detect nearby enemies, as well as teammates, through walls. Effective up to 60 meters, a cast sends out a pulse that lasts 5 seconds then cannot be activated again for 3 seconds. Note: Having EV mapped will allow the player to see enemy EV users when they cast the pulse (Passive EV). Countered by smoke, EV, artifact in attrition.Glider ($2000): Enables short-distance flight and enhanced leaping height. Can also be used to negate fall damage. Locks two essence, best combined with teleport and gust. Gliding players are vulnerable to sniper rifles and rifles due to their slow aerial movement. Gust can deactivate glider wings for one second, forcing player to lose flight momentarily and draw them downward. When gliding activate and deactivate to increase forward movement.Wired Reflexes ($2000): Passively enhance the player's running speed, jumping height and reload speed while equipped and allow the deflection of bullets when wielding a Katana. Can be activated for an extra boost of speed at the expense of some health. When combined with teleport or glider (or both) mobility is greatly increased. Very effective for trolls, countered by gust.Anti-Magic Generators ($1500): Thrown like a grenade, these devices drain essence of any player or magical object caught within their field. Can be devastating if used against Trolls (who lose their armor ability) or Strangle spells. Four in inventory that recharge over time when current AMG's are destroyed or run out. Countered by weapons fire, glider (most AMG's will be on the floor). Players cannot teleport effectively into area covered by an AMG, and when looking directly at one, teleport distance is reduced to one meter.Smartlink ($2000): Implants an ocular aiming system which assists players by increasing auto aim and magnetism (target-lock) and automatically preventing firearms from firing when a teammate is in the cross hair. However, when activated, Smartlink is visible by a red laser beam that emerges from the players eye. Adds level of zoom to all weapons except katana. Locks two pips of essence. Recommended for minigun users. Countered by having smoke mapped. </div>  <div> Weapons : Katana ($1000): The only melee weapon of the lot, this weapon deals a moderate amount of damage (high damage when wielded by troll), has no movement penalty and can kill most races within four swipes. It is capable of causing a player much grief by inflicting a ""mortal wound"" on an unsuspecting player, which deals a high amount of damage and makes the enemy lose health over a period of time, which can only be cured by the resurrection spell. Recommended mostly for trolls and elves. Countered by gust, shotgun ( if user has wired), sustained weapons fire.SMG ($500): The SMG is a cheap, low damage close to mid-range weapon that reloads quickly and features a high rate of fire. It is lightweight, making it a good weapon regardless of race or playing style, but it has a high amount of recoil and is best fired in short, controlled bursts when firing at a distance. Countered by shogun in close range and rifle at farther distances. Gusting SMG users back decreases their effectiveness moderately.Pistol (Free with Spawn): This is your standard, cost-free weapon. The pistol causes low to moderate damage but its accuracy, rate of fire, and no movement penalty make up for it. Highly effective against trolls (especially when shot slowly at troll's head).Rifle ($500): Deals moderate to high damage (headshot deals double damage to all but dwarves) with little recoil at a low price, which makes it a good and popular weapon overall. It is highly useful for damaging enemies at moderate to long ranges, and for marksmen who cannot afford a Sniper Rifle. Humans are ideal rifle users, but all races can benefit from its use. Stay crouched while firing to greatly increase effectiveness. Three shot burst not recommended.Rocket Launcher ($5000): The rocket launcher reigns supreme as the most powerful weapon in the game and, simultaneously the most expensive and the heaviest. It takes a fair while to fire and reload is not very useful against enemies past close to mid-range. $1000 per round. Best used by trolls and dwarves. Use extreme caution when using.Shotgun ($750): A brilliant and cost effective weapon, which can easily stop a charging enemy. A point blank shot deals a massive amount of damage, which decreases as range increases. It's primary drawbacks are its limited range and low rate of fire. Great when combined with wired reflexes. Not recommended for elves due to weight. Shotgun cannot be blocked by wired katana.Minigun ($1250): This bulky weapon makes up for its weight with a lighting fast rate of fire, good stopping power and massive clip size. Recommended for dwaves and trolls, minigun must be wound up to fire, keep the barrels spinning by tapping trigger to begin firing more quickly.Sniper Rifle ($2500): Features 4 shots to a clip and is rather expensive, however, this gun is quite powerful in the hands of a skilled marksman. A single shot to the head will kill all but dwarfs. Can only be fired if zoomed in using the scope, and taking damage will force the player to back out of the zoom. Not recommended for trolls.The game lacks a traditional campaign mode. Instead, various match types are available - solo play against bots, private matches (online or LAN), and live matches which match up players from around the world. The three play modes available are Attrition (Team Deathmatch variant), Extraction (Neutral Flag), and Raid mode (One flag, attack/defend CTF). Each map has two of these three game modes, usually Raid or Extraction and Attrition. Raid being the most common. Some maps also have a reduced-size variant which is reserved for smaller games. </div>  <div> Minimum System Requirements : Microsoft® Windows® Vista™PC with Dual Core CPU2 GB of system RAM4.5 GB available hard disk spaceNVIDIA 7800, ATI X1800 (256 MB or higher) </div>  <div> Xbox 360 Game Installation : Shadowrun requires 3.9GB of space to install on an Xbox 360 HDD.

It also introduces some updates to normal gameplay, such as being able to restrict patterns that are not winnable from the start, while revamping both Challenge and Tournament modes (the latter of which is now a full-blown campaign mode) and adding a built-in puzzle layout editor.The game's sub-title ""Dragon's Eye"" refers to a new game mode of the same name, bringing some of the traditional gameplay mechanics to a brand new turn-based one-on-one experience. In Dragon's Eye, one player is the ""Dragon Master"" and must work to build-up a formation by placing tiles from their three-tile hand, while the other player is the ""Dragon Slayer"" and must break down the formation by matching tiles both on the board and from their five-tile hand.Along with a Japanese arcade adaptation, the game received ports to multiple consoles and home computers of the time, most notably the Sega Genesis (twice, one for different regions), the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Windows PCs. The Japanese ports of the game, handled by Hot-B, were renamed Super Shanghai: Dragon's Eye. Both Windows and Mac versions of the game were also bundled together with Shanghai: Great Moments as the 1997 compilation Shanghai Double Pack. </div>  <div> Gameplay : The game includes three game modes: Shanghai, Dragon's Eye, and Tournament. </div>  <div> Alternate Tilesets : Activision's Sega Genesis version, with a vibrant version of the traditional puzzle and mahjong tilesMuch of the Shanghai mode remains unchanged from the original 1986 game. Players are given 144 mahjong tiles in a stacked formation and must match unrestricted pairs of the same type to remove them. Tiles are considered free to remove if they have no tile above them (even partially) and if they have no adjacent tile to the left or right of them.Depending on the tileset used, games can either have four copies of 34 tiles and eight ""wildcard"" tiles (in which four ""Season"" tiles can match with each other and four ""Flower"" tiles can match with each other) or four copies of 36 tiles.Like the previous game, players can choose to undo their last move, automatically highlight a valid pair, or peek underneath tiles (forfeiting any game in progress). New to the series the ability to shuffle all tiles remaining on the board, allowing players to turn unwinnable games into winnable ones.The game can be played in one of two playing modes: Solitaire and Challenge.Solitaire Mode is a single-player mode with no restrictions or scoring involved.Challenge Mode is a multiplayer mode where two players alternate turns in an attempt to clear the board as fast as they can. Unlike the previous game, where each player has a turn timer, Shanghai II has players keeping track of their overall time and attempt to have the lowest time when the game ends. Highlighting valid pairs adds 30 seconds to the player's timer, while shuffling all remaining tiles adds 60 seconds.Like the previous game, players can choose to undo their last move, automatically highlight a valid pair, and peek underneath tiles (forfeiting any game in progress). New to the series is the ability to shuffle all tiles remaining on the board, allowing players to turn unwinnable games into winnable ones. In Challenge Mode, highlighting a valid pair adds 30 seconds to that player's timer, while shuffling all tiles adds 60 seconds.In the Macintosh version, Challenge Mode has optional turn limits similar to the original game (at either 10, 20, or 30 seconds).In the American Genesis version, the game includes an optional ""Wild Tile"" setting that adds a single Joker tile outside of the layout. This tile can be matched with any other tile, removing that tile and moving the other tile to its location. </div>  <div> Ports & Re-releases : The game includes 12 new tile layouts along with the original (known in-game as Shanghai). They are organized by their perceived difficulty, with higher-difficulty layouts having more tiles that block other tiles.Each layout is based on an animal represented in the Chinese zodiac.EasyBoarDragonRatSnakeAdvancedDogMonkeyRamRoosterMasterHorseOxRabbitTiger </div> "

Side Pocket,Data East,Data East NA/JP Sega PAL,August 1992[35],genesis,"Data East's signature pocket billiards arcade game, featuring a simplistic ruleset (known as ""Pocket Game"") and an intuitive shot system that allows for precise directional aiming and trick shots.",3030-2042,2042,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/side-pocket/3030-2042/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : Side Pocket is a top-down billiards game developed and released by Data East for arcades in June 1986.One of the earliest arcade pool simulators released for arcades, Side Pocket builds on the formula of other top-down billiards games (such as Video Hustler and Super Billiards) by introducing several gameplay mechanics that were later made standard (including the use of rotation instead of a free-form cursor, a preview trajectory for the cue ball, and the ability to alter which part of the cue ball is hit for spins and trick shots).The game's standard mode, later known as ""Pocket Game"", has players attempting to pocket all balls (other than the cue ball) on the table with a limited amount of lives (or ""balls""), with bonus points awarded both for consecutively pocketing balls and for pocketing balls in sequence. In addition, players are given opportunities to sink a ball at a designated pocket to earn bonus points, bonus time, or bonus lives. It also features a post-round mini-game where players have one chance to make a specific trick shot. Home releases added the game of 9-Ball as an alternate multiplayer mode.The game was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, the Game Boy in 1990, the Sega Genesis in 1992, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993, and the Game Gear in 1994. These versions include various improvements, such as a new single-player progression system (where players progress by having high-scoring rounds), an improved spin system (with fine-tuned shots, massé shots, and jump shots), and new gameplay mechanics (such as ""super balls"" and ""zones"").Along with its eroge spin-offs Pocket Gal and Pocket Gal Deluxe, the game received three sequels in Japan: Side Pocket 2: Densetsu no Hustler (which was released in North America as Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend), Side Pocket 3 (which brought the series into full 3D), and Side Pocket for WonderSwan. The original arcade version was also included in the Wii compilation Data East Arcade Classics. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Side Pocket, players control each shot of the cue ball in a top-down perspective (similar to other pool simulation games of the time). Before each shot, players have three options:They can select which direction to hit the cue ball using the joystick, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory. For precise aiming, the game has players holding down the joystick in a particular direction to begin rotating the cursor towards it.They can use the Spin button and the joystick to change which part of the ball to spin it. Home ports build upon this by allowing multiple levels of each type of spin (including hidden massé shots). Left/Right shots curve the ball in either direction once it hits an object, Draw shots has the cue ball retreat once it hits an object, and Follow shots has the cue ball push forward once it hits an object. Massé shots are unique in that it has the cue ball spin backwards (and optionally left/right) soon after it is shot, and can also be used to launch the ball into the air over other balls.They then perform the shot itself by hitting the Shot button (to start the Power Meter). The Power Meter swings left and right, and players press the Shot button to lock-in the power of the shot and hit it. In some versions, players can cancel the shot using a Cancel button. </div>  <div> Ports : In the standard ""Pocket Game"", players start each set with one of two alternate racks of balls: six balls in a standard pyramid formation (similar to the game of 6-Ball) or nine balls in a thin diamond formation (similar to the game of 9-Ball). Home versions also include a ten-ball pyramid formation (similar to the games of 8-Ball and 10-Ball). Players can pocket each ball in the rack any order, and the set ends when all of these balls are pocketed.Similar to other billiards games at the time, players have a limited amount of shots (or ""balls"") that deplete if the player either pockets the cue ball (for two shots) or fails to pocket any other ball (for one shot). Pocketing the cue ball also causes the other pocketed balls in that shot to return to the table. In addition, the Arcade version of the game has a timer that slowly depletes when the player is figuring out their shot (and can be replenished by pocketing balls). Once the timer or allowed shots depletes, the credit ends and players must add additional credits to continue. In Home versions, there is no timer and players are given more shots to start out with, but players cannot continue.At certain times in the round, one pocket is highlighted and if players pocket a ball in there, they receive bonus points. In the Arcade version, this can be bonus time. In single-player modes, this can be bonus balls. In Home versions of the game, having one racked ball remaining causes one pocket to highlight as the ""Zone"" and players can hit their cue ball in there to enter a special state where if they pocket the final ball in that shot, they earn additional bonus balls. In addition, the Home versions include a ""super shot"" where at certain times, hitting the 9-Ball or 10-Ball causes the table to have less friction (making the shot more hectic).In addition to points earned by pocketing balls and by bonus points, players are scored after each set by each sequence of balls pocketed consecutively and by each sequence of balls pocketed in a numerical sequence, with longer sequences earning more points. In Home versions, high-scoring sets are required to progress through the game. The game also includes a bonus ""trick shot"" between sets, where the table is set-up in a particular way (usually with obstacles) and players must pot balls in specific pockets without hitting obstacles in order to gain additional bonus points.In two-player multiplayer matches, players attempt to end a multi-set match with the highest score (with no ""trick shot"" mini-game). Players do not have a limited amount of balls to work with, instead switching between each player once they either pocket the cue ball or fail to pocket any ball. The Home versions do not include Super Shots or Zones. </div> "

It also borrows elements of the 1988 John Carpenter movie They Live, in particular the way Bart can see the aliens through special sunglasses. </div>  <div> Story :  Bart wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a UFO. He is the only one that knows about the alien invasion. Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of ""Maggie"", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the ""spin the wheel"" minigame. </div>  <div> Levels : Location: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: Maggie </div> "

These strange birds have magical properties, and one of those powers include traveling to different dimensions through large gold rings. Also on this island are the seven Chaos Emeralds that have incredible powers. Dr. Robotnik discovers this island and he realizes that these 7 gems are here. Then, he finds the Flickies and turns them into robot minions to help him search for the Emeralds.Sonic, who is a friend of the Flikies, shows up at the island. He finds what his nemesis Robotnik has done to them, and now it's up to Sonic to destroy all of Robotink's badniks to free all of the Flickies. Sonic and the Flickies then help each other out to prevent Dr. Robotnik's plans. That is where the birds ability to transport to altered dimensions comes in. This useful power is the way to get to Robotnik and ultimately stop him from getting the Chaos Emeralds and gaining the power to rule the world. </div>  <div> Zones : Playing as Sonic, the player must destroy Robotnik's robots or badniks in order to release the trapped Flickies. Then the player has to collect those Flickies in order to advance to the next zone by going through a large gold ring. The player has to collect five Flickies to advance. The game has seven zones each with three acts. Act 1 and 2 are regular levels which the player explores around the level, destroys enemies, and collects Flickies. The third act is a boss battle.Sonic in ""3D""Their is four types of enemies each level and each of those enemies releases a different colored Flicky. Blue Flickies try to find Sonic and when they can't find him they fly around in circle. Pink Flickies are the same as blue ones, but fly around in a larger circle. Red Flickies fly from point A to point B and they don't try to find Sonic, they also jump at times, and they are difficult to catch. Green Filckies make no attempt to find Sonic and move around randomly. Once Sonic reaches and touches him they follow him around. If Sonic is attacked by an badnik he loses a Flicky and he must get him back.Controlling Sonic and other gameplay features are much like other Sonic games. For the Genesis, the D-pad moves sonic around the area, the A button and C button make Sonic jump, and the B button makes Sonic roll into a ball and do a spin dash. And, like many other Sonic games, collecting rings prevents Sonic from dying when he is attacked by enemies. </div>  <div> Wii Virtual Console version : The game's levels consist of seven full zones, each comprising two regular acts and one boss act, and one final boss zone that is only accessible to the player if Sonic has collected all Chaos Emeralds.

Sonic Mania,Sonic Team,Sega,"October 18, 1994",genesis,An official throwback to the early-'90s Sega Genesis roots of the Sonic the Hedgehog series from some notable creators of the series's fanwork.,3030-54733,54733,0,2017-08-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-mania/3030-54733/,PEGI: 7+," <div> Overview : Sonic Mania is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed by a group of indie studios (composed of project lead Christian Whitehead, programmer Headcannon, and some designers and composers of PagodaWest) and published digitally by Sega for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch on August 15, 2017. It was later released for the PC on August 29, 2017.Developed as an official collaborative effort between creators previously known for Sonic the Hedgehog fanwork (including the enhanced ports of Sonic CD, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Sonic the Hedgehog 2), Sonic Mania is heavily stylized on the series's original early-'90s Genesis-based platformers. Along with Sonic Forces, it was announced in commemoration of the series's 25th anniversary.Players control one of three playable heroes (Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles), each with their own unique abilities, as they navigate their way through the hostile robotic forces of Dr. Eggman, who is harnessing the power of a mysterious gemstone. Along with remastered versions of classic levels from the series, the game features a variety of new locales (each with their own unique obstacles and puzzles).The game later received a paid ""Encore"" DLC on July 17, 2018, adding two new characters (Mighty the Armadillo and Ray the Flying Squirrel, each with their own unique abilities), an alternate Story Mode (known as ""Encore Mode"", featuring an expanded ""buddy"" mechanic), and an expanded Competition Mode (with four-player split-screen support).

Sonic the Hedgehog 2,Sonic Team,Sega,"November 24, 1992",genesis,"Run, jump and spin through levels as Sonic and Tails, in order to thwart the plans of the nefarious Dr. Robotnik and free the kidnapped animals! Released by Sega in 1992, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is often considered one of the greatest platformers of all time.",3030-1662,1662,0,1992-10-16,https://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-2/3030-1662/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : A year after the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 burst on to the scene. Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles ""Tails"" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow. </div>  <div> Plot : Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven ""Chaos Emeralds"" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called ""The Special Zone"".Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him ""Tails"" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the ""Death Egg."" Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs. </div>  <div> Special Stage : The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies. </div>  <div> Two Player Versus Mode : Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it. </div>  <div> Compatibility with Sonic & Knuckles : By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cartridge into the top of the Sonic & Knuckles cartridge, the player will play as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles.There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Some minor changes to levels were also made so the player could find extra secrets or shortcuts using Knuckles climbing and gliding abilities. </div>  <div> Re-Releases : The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3Sega Mega Drive and Genesis Classics Collection for PCSega 3D Classics for the Nintendo 3DSSega Forever for Mobile PlatformsSega Genesis Classics for Playstation 4 and Xbox OneSega Ages for the Nintendo Switch </div>  <div> Zones : Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone has 3 acts and towards the end of the game Sky Chase Zone, Wing Fortress Zone and Death Egg Zone all have a single act. </div>  <div> Soundtrack : The first zone of Sonic 2 bares more than a passing resemblance to Green Hill Zone from the previous game. Emerald Hill is set inside a tropical resort, featuring palm trees, rolling green hills, and wildlife-themed enemies like monkeys, fish and bees. Dr. Robotnik appears here, driving a drill-based machine that he tries to ram in to Sonic. </div>  <div> Development History : This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid. Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below. The player must avoid his attacks while remaining on a series of platforms, which feature panels that will successively rotate. </div>  <div> Trivia : This zone is set in the ruins of a sinking city as it succumbs to the depths of a lake. The low routes lead deep under the surface and features a significantly higher level of challenge, so players are advised to keep their heads above water whenever possible. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down. </div>  <div> 8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game : This zone is set in a series of giant pinball tables, featuring flippers, bumpers and a number of slot machines. Dr. Robotnik appears here at the bottom of the last pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik. </div> "
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,Sonic Team,Sega,"February 2, 1994",genesis,"Play as Sonic or Tails to chase down Doctor Robotnik/Eggman once again. This time Sonic must also face a new enemy, Knuckles the Echidna.",3030-4628,4628,0,1994-02-02,https://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/3030-4628/,PEGI: 3+," <div> Overview : Sonic 3's final boss encounterAfter taking a year break, Sonic Team was back with a vengeance with Sonic the Hedgehog 3 in 1994. Much like the improvements of Sonic 2 over Sonic 1, Sonic 3 offers more content, more moves, and a new character - Knuckles the Echidna. There was so much new content that there was not enough time to finish it all in time for the game's release deadline; (a situation not unlike the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog title) a large portion had to be cut and repackaged as Sonic & Knuckles later on in the same year, essentially allowing Sega to market and sell what was originally meant to be a single Sonic title as two separate, full priced games.Like all Sonic games, the premise still remains the same: Get to the end of the level, while grabbing rings along the way, and destroying any enemy robots that may impede progress. Like Sonic 2, each world consists of two acts - the new twist being that act 1 ends on a ""mini-boss"", with act 2 ending with a typical encounter with the dastardly Doctor Eggman (aka Robotnik). Acts 1 and 2 also appear to be seamlessly and directly joined, now - rather than an Act ending, fading to black, and the next Act starting, Act 2 starts directly where Act 1 leaves off with no other transition to speak of.Sonic 3 also introduces a new elemental shield system. Previously all Sonic games had one type of shield item Sonic could find that protected him from one attack before disappearing. In Sonic 3, shields still act this same same but now come in 3 distinct flavors, with each shield having a special move that is accessible by pressing the button while in the air. The shields are Fire, Bubble, and Electric. Each shield also protects Sonic from an element of that type: the Bubble Shield allows Sonic to stay underwater without having to breathe and bounce downwards mid-jump, the Fire Shield lets Sonic withstand fire attacks and as well as dash forward on a double jump and the Electric Shield reflects energy projectiles and attracts rings while offering a significantly higher double jump.Another new addition to the series is the addition of mini bonus stages, a new type of bonus stage. Previously all Sonic games had special stages which allowed Sonic to collect chaos emeralds by playing some mini-games, Sonic 3 not only has an all-new type of special stages, which are now initiated by finding hidden special stage rings, but also adds optional mini bonus rounds, activated at checkpoints. These levels take multiple forms - For instance, one has Sonic bouncing up to a giant gumball machine which dispense various power-ups for Sonic and Tails Unlike a traditional special stage there is no reward for completing these stages other than the various power-ups that Sonic can attain during them. Sonic accesses Bonus Rounds by passing a starpost (i.e. checkpoint) with at least a certain amount of rings or more, whereas special stages are accessed by finding large rings hidden (and some not that hidden) throughout the levels.Finally, due to the sheer size of the game and its massive levels (some of the largest in the franchise's history), Sonic 3 is the first Genesis Sonic game to implement SRAM for save game data, a feature conspicuously absent from Sonic The Hedgehog 2. </div>  <div> Plot : Ice Cap zoneWhile taking a much needed rest and vacation with Sonic after destroying the Death Egg, Tails begins to detect odd energy readings on a jewel radar he had been tinkering with. The strangest part being it were receiving these energy readings from the middle of the ocean - a location in which there were no islands or land to speak of, and the type of energy it was picking up was characterized by a Chaos Emerald; but it would have to be a Chaos Emerald larger than any they had ever previously encountered.On the other side of the beach, Sonic the Hedgehog discovers a strange type of ring he's never seen before. Being oddly well-versed in ancient civilizations for a Hedgehog, he recalls a story he once heard of a society, favored by the Gods, who were given a giant stone of great power as a gift. This stone of power became a focal point of the civilization's culture, but as is always the case, absolute power corrupts absolutely. It was not long until arguments broke out over who got to use the stone of power for what - arguments turned to wars, wars turned to bloodshed. This angered the Gods greatly, and from within the stone of power, a terrible force was unleashed that obliterated the civilization overnight. The island containing the civilization was banished to the sky as "" Angel Island"", and a lone guardian was posted to protect the stone to ensure nobody could ever misuse its powers again. Sonic and Tails, both excited by the prospect of a new adventure, set off in the direction of the mysterious energy readings.What they discover is the remains of the Death Egg had, after plummeting out of the sky, landed on Angel Island - its incredible weight crashing down and sinking the island to sea level once again. Fearing Doctor Robotnik is seeking the Stone of Power for to revitalize the Death Egg, Sonic and Tails cautiously approach the mysterious island... </div>  <div> Zones : Each zone has 2 acts.

His replacements are a number of different people, most notably members from Michael Jackson's personal sound production team ( Brad Buxer, Doug Grisby III, Bobby Brooks, Darryl Ross and Geoff Grace). Early in the game's development cycle Sega had struck a deal with Jackson to lend his talents to the game's soundtrack, but Jackson was reportedly not happy with the sound quality produced by the Genesis, and on top of that, Sega downplayed his involvement when Michael became entangled in the molestation controversy. The remaining tracks in the game that were not composed by Michael Jackson's sound team were done by American composer Howard Drossin and Japanese composer Jun Senoue. Senoue would later become the leading musician for the Sonic franchise.1.Theme of ""Sonic & Knuckles""01:152.Mushroom Hill03:033.Flying Battery02:554.The Boss04:285.Sandopolis02:576.Lava Reef03:167.Rings and Diamonds Land04:468.Sky Sanctuary02:509.Deathegg03:0110.Boss the Boss04:1711.""Sonic & Knuckles"" Re-Mix11:4612.Theme of ""Knuckles""01:36 </div>  <div> Development History : After Sonic the Hedgehog 2 went on to become even more successful than the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sega of Japan invited Yuji Naka and Sonic Team back to the land of the rising sun to begin work on Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Meanwhile, Sega Technical Institute in America began work on Sonic Spinball. Originally, Sonic Team wanted Sonic 3 to play off of the idea of being 3-Dimensional; an early gameplay test considered making the entire game in top-down, seen from an isometric view. Worried they would be changing the game too dramatically, they scrapped this concept and went back to making Sonic 3 a traditional side-scrolling Sonic game.Like Sonic 1 and Sonic 2, an internal character design contest was held for the new character in Sonic 3. Winning this round was Takashi ""Thomas"" Yuda, for his Knuckles the Echidna design. The original design for Knuckles had him green in color, but after some focus testing, it was decided that red would be a more suitable hue. </div>  <div> Trivia : Yuji Naka once again took inspiration from his favorite anime, Dragon Ball Z: the 3D Bonus Stages in this game were inspired by King Kai's miniature planet at the end of Snake Way.A number of tracks in this game, no doubt in relation to a certain American Pop-Star's involvement with music production, resemble Michael Jackson songs (for example, the song played over the credits bares considerable resemblance to the song ""Stranger in Moscow"").Though the concept of an isometric Sonic game was scrapped for Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Travelers Tales later revisited the concept in the form of Sonic 3D Blast. </div> "

The story involves Sonic infiltrating Dr. Robotnik's diabolical lair (the Veg-O-Fortress) on Mt. Mobius (thwarting his latest plan to turn the animals of planet Mobius into robots). This time, he must make use of Dr. Robotnik's new Pinball Defense System to navigate the lair.The Genesis version was included in numerous compilations (including Sega Smash Pack, Sonic Mega Collection, Sonic Mega Collection Plus, Sonic Gems Collection as a limited ""demo"", and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection).

Each Bonus Stage plays at a specific time and do not have to be completed; even if the player loses at the Trapped Alive stage after completing the first level, they will still proceed to the Robo Smile stage after completing the second. </div> "

It was released under the name Sparkster in the US, which further adds to the confusion when referring to both versions. </div>  <div> Plot : The kingdom of Zephyrus is once again under attack, this time from King Gedol of the Gedol Empire. Like déjà vu, Sparkster's rival Axel Gear is dispatched once again, this time kidnapping Princess Cherry, whom is Princess Sherry's cousin. Rocket back into action, rescue Cherry from the clutched of King Gedol, and liberate the Kingdom of Zephyrus once again. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Sparkster's gameplay is not unlike it's predecessor. Attack, Jump, and fly through one of the many 2D side-scrolling stages filled with enemies, hidden/alternate routes, platforms and the like. </div>  <div> Version Differences : In addition to being a direct story continuation of the original game, Rocket Knight Adventures 2 brings along with it evolved mechanics. The biggest change being the way the player charges their rocket pack. In the original game (and Super Nintendo's Sparkster), the player charges their pack by holding down the attack button, then release when the bar is full for maximum propulsion. In Genesis Sparkster there is a dedicated boost button, and the pack charges automatically without holding it down. Because it charges while the player is performing other actions, and is much faster, Sparkster can sustain flight in the game's large free-roaming stages.To obtain the True Ending of the game, Sparkster must collect six secret swords hidden within the levels, which will unlock Gold Sparkster. During the final encounter of the game, he will become Gold Sparkster in the same vein as Super Sonic from the Sonic the Hedgehog series... with the exception that Sparkster can sustain damage during this gold period. Failure to obtain the swords results in the bad ending of the game, simply telling the player to ""try again."".As this is a continuation of the original game with different mechanics and goals in stages, the stages them self are also completely different from the Super Nintendo incarnation; making this an entirely fresh gameplay experience. </div> "
Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe,The Bitmap Brothers,Arena EntertainmentCSK JP,December 1991,genesis,Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is the most realised iteration of the Speedball franchise. Speedball is a brutal sport where armoured teams face-off in a metal-clad arena with the aim of beating down their rivals and scoring goals for fame and fortune.,3030-289,289,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe/3030-289/,ESRB: E," <div> Overview : One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp GatesThere are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay. </div> "

In this brawler the player controls Spider-Man or Venom as they join forces against the psychopathic Carnage.The game structure is divided by stages and each stage may be side or top-down scroller. For the majority of them, the player can move the character on a Z-Axis, as seen with classic games like Golden Axe or Final Fight.The gameplay involves a lot of button mashing for getting combos and sending the enemies to the void. There's no character upgrades nor is there any level progression.The story is told mainly by comic book style cutscenes between stages, that brings to the player the original comic art with some minor animations. </div>  <div> Story : The game opens in Ravencroft Asylum, where Cletus Kasady -- a maniacal killer who carries ""Carnage"", a spawn of the Venom symbiote -- is being escorted to a cell. The Carnage symbiote emerges during the escort, and, after gaining control of Kasady, kills all of the guards in the complex. Carnage meets Shriek, a woman with the ability to manipulate sound into concussive blasts, and they gather a ""family"" of villains -- including Doppelganger (a six-armed Spider-Man look-alike whose mask is adorned with gruesome teeth and whose web is made of barbed wire), Demogoblin (a demon that bears likeness to the Hobgoblin), and Carrion (a man infected with a virus that grants him the ability to turn organic matter into ash). With their group assembled, the ""family"" begins a killing spree in New York, the likes of which have never been seen.Spider-Man, seeing the effect Carnage's crusade is having on the thug community of New York, tries to stop the riots in the streets with a hands-on approach that, after a confrontation with Shriek and Doppelganger, nearly kills him. Cloak and Dagger intervene before a vicious gang step in with the killing stroke, and Cloak teleports Spider-Man to a nearby church. Having followed Spider-Man to his temporary resting place, Shriek and Doppelganger attack the trio of heroes, and though they fight valiantly, Carnage announces his presence with authority by stabbing Dagger. Content with the chaos he's created, Carnage leaves the church with his compatriots.Eddie Brock, the man carrying the ""Venom"" symbiote, sees the reports of Carnage's rampage in the newspaper the following morning. His anger wells, and Venom imposes itself quickly over Brock's will. Venom devotes himself to reaching New York before Carnage destroys more lives.Venom arrives in New York to confront Carnage, who is both surprised and quite pleased his symbiotic counterpart has come to join the chaos, but Carnage commits both Shriek and Doppelganger to stop Venom. A brutal battle wages between the three warriors, and Venom's might is admirable, but the combined power of the ""family"" proves greater than the resolve of the elder symbiote. Knowing defeat, Venom escapes with his life and plants his broken body on the doorstep of Peter Parker.Carnage allows Demogoblin to begin his assault on Manhattan, and Spider-Man, understanding the gravity of the situation, takes an oath to align himself with Venom in order to stop Kasady's madness. Venom takes on Demogoblin, while Spider-Man fights his way through waves of gang members to reach Carnage's ad hoc headquarters -- a nightclub called ""The Deep"". Spider-Man's newfound rage leads him through a gauntlet battle against the bulk of Carnage's crew, but when the ""family"" manages to escape, it becomes duly apparent that a new plan is necessary to unbalance and overthrow Carnage's reign over the fear of the city.Venom suggests Carnage, despite his heightened strengths, may still be vulnerable to the same weaknesses against which Venom falters. Spider-Man decides to infiltrate the laboratory of Reed Richards to obtain the Fantastic Four's Sonic Gun, as the symbiote only appears weak to sonic sound waves and fire.After obtaining Richards's sonic gun, the group of heroes (now aided by fire-manipulating Firestar) manage to lure Carnage and his troops to Prospect Park, where a heated battle erupts between all of the heroes. The conflict culminates with the heroes seemingly victorious, and Firestar uses a plume of flames to end Carnage's reign forever. Spider-Man, however, refuses to bring himself to the level of a maniac like Kasady, and orders Firestar to stop before Kasady dies along with the symbiote. Venom grows angry at Spider-Man's empathy and self-righteousness, and provokes Parker into a brawl that escalates into Venom knocking Spider-Man down a steep hill and proclaiming his unending hate for the webslinger. The heroes rush to Spider-Man's aid, leaving Venom alone with Carnage and Shriek, who regain their energy and overwhelm Venom, whisking him away with the Sonic Gun in-hand.Holding Venom hostage in the Statue of Liberty, Carnage tortures him by holding him above a fire, and shooting him with intermittent blasts from the Sonic Gun, allowing the symbiote to neither dissipate completely nor fully regain its vigor. Spider-Man and ever-increasing cascade of heroes (Captain America now joins the group) continue their push against the ""family,"" but Venom manages to free himself, willing the symbiote to bat the Sonic Gun out of Carnage's hand and escape from the Statue of Liberty. He meets with Spider-Man in the now-riotous streets of Manhattan for a final clash against Shriek and the minions, and they overcome both the ""family"" and Carnage when he arrives in pursuit of Venom.Comfortable that Carnage has been dealt with, Spider-Man and Venom have a last interchange in Central Park. Peace washes over New York as the sun rises over the horizon and a serene silence signifies the end of the reign of terror. As the two unlikely heroes begin to part ways, Carnage arises -- nearly completely regenerated -- from the nearby lake to do battle once more. Fearing the conflict has no end, Spider-Man grows weary and edges near defeat, yet the Avengers arrive as Carnage is dealt a final, crushing blow, and it seems certain Carnage will never be free again. </div> "

Starflight,Binary Systems,Electronic Arts,November 1991,genesis,"An open-ended space adventure that allows the player to explore 270 star systems and 800 planets, Starflight has players xplore the final frontier in search of knowledge or combat.",3030-3607,3607,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/starflight/3030-3607/,," <div> Overview : Starflight is an open-world RPG/space-sim in which the player's ship is able to explore space, talk to aliens, gather resources from worlds, mark them as suitable for colonization, and eventually solve a far-reaching quandary that threatens to extinguish all life in the galaxy. First released on PC, it was eventually made available on multiple home computer platforms as well as the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was followed by a sequel, Starflight 2, in 1989.Title Screen (DOS)Starflight takes place in a galaxy comprised of 270 star systems, each of which contains a number of planets (there are over 800 planets in all). Each planet has its own unique topography, climate, and gravity. The player is tasked to maintain, upgrade and staff their own starship in an RPG-like fashion. The ship is used to explore the galaxy and retrieve artifacts, minerals, and life forms from the surface of planets, which can then be sold to further upgrade the ship and the skills of its crew. While exploring the galaxy, players may also come across a number of alien races. How the player chooses deal with these encounters plays a major role in the progression of the game. </div>  <div> Plot : The story begins on a planet named Arth. Years earlier, scientists discovered a deep shaft in the crust of the planet, leading to a vast and ancient underground network. Investigation of this network revealed it to have been built by the first colonists of Arth (remnants of an ancient society called the Old Empire). In addition to this historical data, scientists also uncovered sufficient technical data which allowed them reconstruct some of the Old Empire's technology. The most significant discovery was that of a mysterious crystalline substance known as Endurium, which served as the fuel for their superphotonic (faster than light) technology.Space TravelUsing this information, a company named Interstel is able to successfully build new ships capable of interstellar travel. With limited supplies of fuel available, Interstel builds a small fleet of ships and tasks them to search the galaxy for more resources (most importantly, Endurium). Players assume the role of a starship captain recruited by the Interstel corporation. In addition to procuring Endurium and other important minerals, players are also given a number of other goals: search for new habitable planets; discover more information about the Old Empire and the history of Arth; and build relationships with the other spacefaring races in the galaxy.As resources are built and more of the galaxy is explored, this initial setup (while seemingly simple) eventually gives way to a more complex over-arching narrative. Through a series of events (involving hostile alien races, ancient artifacts, and a mysterious Crystal Planet), the fate of the entire galaxy ends up in the player's hands! </div>  <div> The Making of Starflight : The Starflight TeamThe following information is taken verbatim from the packaging of the DOS version of Starflight:The Dream""Back in 1982, we approached E.A. with the idea of creating a universe on a disk that would let people experience the feeling of exploring the universe. It was an ambitious idea. We knew it would require a lot of time and the development of some new technology. We were more right than we knew.""The Cutting Room Floor""We rewrote the game script several times as we struggled to achieve our goals. We wanted the universe to convey a gigantic sense of space, complexity, and life. And we wanted an exciting fantasy role-playing game, with a wide spectrum of character interaction and activity. It seemed like whenever we were close to finalizing the script, we'd find another way to make the game more fun.""The Planet Builder""About nine months after we started the actual programming, we came up with the idea for the fractal generator. A fractal generator so powerful that it could create surfaces in space. It took 6 man-years to create the technology, but it gave us the ability to cram 800 complex and unique planets into each game, instead of the 50 we'd had before. There are so many that even we haven't explored them all.""The Aliens""To find the right names for each race, we wrote long profiles and histories for each, then tossed random syllables at each other for several days. To handle their languages, behavior, and combat-action, we had to devote months to building a sophisticated artificial intelligence system. We threw away the communications module three times before we had exactly what we wanted. Sometimes we wondered which would come first, flying to the stars in Starflight, or flying to the stars in real life.""Breathing Ammonia""Once the fractal generator builds a planet, the eco-system generator creates environmental conditions for it, like gravity, atmosphere, minerals, and temperature. Once we took a journey back to Earth, only to find the eco-system generator had given it new continents and an ammonia atmosphere. It took two years to perfect the technology.""15 Man-Years Later""The last several months were spent tying all the various technologies together. Because of the program's complexity and scope, the play-testing alone took months. But all the time and effort has proven worthwhile. We had a vision of what an outer space fantasy game could be, and now that vision is a reality."" </div> "

Steel Talons,Tengen,Tengen,December 1992,genesis,A combat helicopter arcade game made by Atari in 1991. It has a dual sit-in cabinet that allows for both co-operative and competitive play. It features three missions and one death-match arena.,3030-9506,9506,0,1991-12-31,https://www.giantbomb.com/steel-talons/3030-9506/,," <div> Overview :  The original Steel Talons two player arcade cabinet.Steel Talons is a helicopter combat arcade game released by Atari in 1991. It is a spiritual successor to Battlezone, another vector graphics based war game. The arcade cabinet is a side by side two player cabinet that allowed the player to sit inside while they play to recreate the experience of being inside an actual helicopter cockpit. The game features large open world levels in several different terrains, and the possibility of both co-operative and competitive play with the player on the other side of the cabinet.Steel Talons was ported to the Genesis and Super Nintendo, as well as Atari's home systems the Atari ST, Atari Lynx and Atari Falcon. Each system approached the game's 3D vector polygon graphics differently.  </div>  <div> Gameplay : Steel Talons is a helicopter combat simulator where the player is placed into a stage and given an objective to complete. These objectives can be either combat related, such as clearing out all the enemies on the field, to trying to fly through a canyon without crashing into the walls. Almost all levels feature some enemies that the player has to fight, and as the game progresses and the difficulty ramps up, the number of enemies and their aggression ramps up considerably.The player can only take a certain amount of damage before their helicopter explodes, but this does not end the game then and there. Death only depletes the player's fuel supply, which serves as both the unofficial time meter and the player's lives. In earlier levels, the limited amount of enemies gave the player ample time to clear them out before the fuel gauge ran out, but in later levels the player has little room for error before they start running low. The fuel gauge serves as both a time limit for stages, and as a way to get more quarters out of the player, as each additional quarter refuels the helicopter in mid level. Earlier levels feature enemies that are scattered so the player only has to handle one at a time, and they also attack much less frequently and from closer distances. As the difficulty ramps up, enemies are grouped together and attack when they are farther away making them much more challenging to take out. If the player completes a level, their helicopter is repaired for the next. Co-operative play is available if both players start the game and selects the same level at the same time. Co-operative play makes the game significantly easier as players can either attack enemies together drawing fire and sharing the damage, or by heading out separately and clearing out the level in half of the time. A co-op game also helps out players by preventing any game overs as long as one player remains alive. While crashing in single-player forced the player to restart from scratch, as long as one person is left in the stage, the other can start over with a new helicopter and join in again. If two players start at the same time, they can also unlock and select a death-match stage in the game which is dedicated to one on one combat with the other player. Unlike the other stages, this level is much smaller and features a sort of urban environment with large towers for players to hide behind and try to catch their opponent off guard. While unique for the time, the combat is somewhat limited as the players only had two weapons at their disposal, and it often boiled down to who managed to sneak up on the other first. Given the slow moving nature of helicopters, if one player was behind the other, they can often get a missile lock or a good number of bullets into their opponent before they can run away or turn around to fire back.  </div>  <div> Controls : The arcade cabinet for Steel Talons featured somewhat realistic controls for the time. It has three major controls for the player to use all at the same time in order to fly and attack. The first was the joystick that stood front and center in front of the player. The joystick controls the tilt of the helicopter allowing it to move forwards and backwards and strafe from side to side. The joystick features two buttons, a trigger in the front and a thumb button off to the side. The trigger controls the 30mm canon machine guns which have unlimited ammo. There is no cross hair or targeting on the screen, so the computer aims at whatever target it assumes the player is pointing at. This occasionally leaves the player attacking a target they didn't want to whenever enemies become more clustered. The thumb button launches missiles of which the player has a finite supply per stage. Missiles lock on to targets automatically after they came into range for a short period of time and home in once fired. The missiles are very powerful and can usually destroy a target in one hit. Underneath the joystick is a set of foot pedals for the player to rest their feet on. These pedals control rotation of the helicopter allowing players to either maintain altitude and change their position, or the change the angle of their forward momentum. Underneath the seat to the left hand side is the collective. This handle controls the altitude of the helicopter at any given time, allowing the player to rise up beyond the reach of enemy fire, or to hide behind any low cover that is available. The collective has a bright yellow handle that was similar to a rubber bicycle handle. The seat itself is also an integral part of the full body experience. It came with a feature called the ""Rump Thump"" which shakes the seat whenever a player is being hit. This is more than a simple vibration as the Rump Thump feels and sounds violent, as if a hammer is being banged against it, which probably isn't far from the truth of how the device worked. Rump Thump was short lived however, appearing only in Steel Talons and Road Riot 4WD, but it was in many ways a precursor to more modern arcade setups that have similar, more elegant force feedback and speakers in the seats. Players have a heads up display on the screen at all times that gives them information about how much fuel they have left, enemies on the radar, their missile supply, and a small screen that either displays the area map or tells them what they were targeting at that moment. This is particularly useful because the limited vector graphics available at the time left a lot to be desired, and it would look as if the player was targeting grey squares on the ground. This helps create a better picture of what is going on, and also helps the player know if they were shooting at an enemy that can fight back, or simply a building next to it.  </div> "
Stormlord,Punk Development,RazorsoftNAMicro WorldJP,June 1991,genesis,The Stormlord is tasked with emancipating all the captured fairies of a dying world in this controversial side-scrolling action-adventure game. ,3030-1044,1044,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/stormlord/3030-1044/,," <div> Overview : Stormlord is an action-adventure game released in 1989 on a number of home computer platforms, including the Commodore 64, PC, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Atari ST. Its story involves rescuing a number of fairies trapped across a hostile world of traps and monsters that only the Stormlord can brave with his command of lightning and magic.It was eventually ported to the Sega Genesis around 1991, but because the game included imagery of topless women (the fairy statues) Sega forced the publishers Razorsoft to cease cart production until the statues were covered up. This lead to several months of litigation between the two companies until Razorsoft relented, relinquished the cart manufacturing to Sega (they had previously built their own), and Sega released the game around the summer of 1991 with the censored statues. </div>  <div> Gameplay : In Stormlord, the goal is to save a number of trapped fairies across each stage and then leave via the exit. The captured fairies were often placed where the player had to solve a puzzle of some kind to reach them: this could mean finding a key to a locked door, or hitching a ride with Mael Avin the great eagle to reach closed-off areas of the level.The Stormlord has a weak projectile attack that can be charged up by holding the attack button down a moment before releasing, though some smaller enemies are easier to avoid by jumping over them. </div>  <div> Unwinnable State : There is an unwinnable state in Level 1. The area with the final fairy collectable does not have a return teleporter to call Mael Avin, the great eagle. Collecting this fairy without collecting all other fairies creates an unwinnable state as collecting all fairies is the only method to end the level. The player must reset the game, wait for the timer to run out, or allow an enemy to kill the player character (as seen in Ranking of Evil 03). </div> "

In it players can race through two main modes: Senna GP, in which players can race on a Senna-designed track, and World Championship mode. The world championship mode has two settings: Beginner and Master. The Beginner mode is a straightforward drivers championship, where the driver at the end of the season with the most points is the winner. The Master mode includes the concept of teams and rival drivers. In this mode, players start in a low ranked team with the objective of advancing and eventually taking Senna's place at the top of the food chain.Meet Nigel Mansell's unlicensed cousinPlayers can challenge rival drivers and replace them in the team if they won.The teams were arranged in 5 tiers with the master himself in a separate class altogether. The game only licensed Senna's likeness, so all the rival drivers and teams were slight variants on real ones. Even Senna's team in the game was an original team called ""Madonna"" as opposed to his real team at the time, McClaren.The tracks are relatively close to their real life counterparts, and Senna advised developers about track characteristics. They even followed the order of the real life Formula 1 calendar. Each track has some unique background elements such as a city or forest. Some tracks even feature rain on random occasions.Even with all these realistic elements, the game's handling can best be described as arcadey. This was a characteristic of console racing games of the time. More realistic racing games could be found on the PC, but for many Genesis owners, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II brought Formula 1 in to the home. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : Upon release, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores: 6,8,6,5 adding, ""...this is a game that only a dyed-in-the-wool racer will love.

Smash TV retains this same gameplay, using the left joystick to move and the right to shoot, allowing a player to move in one direction while firing in another.Evil M.C.The year is 1999. A new game show called Smash TV was created which puts its contenders to the fight for their lives. They will have to kill hundreds of enemies and collect money and prizes (from toasters to a big-screen TV). The inspiration for Smash TV seems to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, The Running Man. Two players can play simultaneously, and at the end of each of the three levels, the two players' performance is compared, with one being declared the winner.Each level ends with a boss battle. The first level pits the players against Mutoid Man. The second boss is a giant, round face named Scarface. The third level seemingly ends with a fight against two large, robotic snake heads called Die Cobros. But this is immediately followed by the game's true boss, the game show host himself called Evil M.C. This battle is essentially a tougher version of the Mutoid Man boss fight. </div>  <div> Home Versions : Super Smash TV for the SNES After its success in coin-operated form, Smash TV was brought to the home market on many different console and computer platforms. Home game consoles of the era were not equipped with multi-joystick controllers; alternative control schemes were implemented to approximate the controls of the arcade original. While some versions use buttons to fire in a direction, or to toggle a direction, others use multiple controllers' joysticks. Acclaim's SNES version of the game, Super Smash TV (referred to by its original name within the game), used the D-pad and face buttons to duplicate the two joysticks of the original. The SNES version also contains additional secret rooms.The Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is an emulation of the original arcade release, controls with its two joysticks. It is also the only version to include online play, letting two players play the game over the Internet.This game is featured on Midway Arcade Treasures for the Gamecube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC. </div>  <div> Achievements : Due to a glitch in the Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, 360 users are unable to obtain the full 200 achievement points available in the game. The Game Master Achievement (in theory obtained by beating the game without continuing on default systems) does not unlock, denying gamers the game's final 50 points. The publishers have acknowledged the problem, but there are currently no plans to fix the issue. </div>  <div> Sequels : Though Smash TV never received a proper sequel, many of the same people responsible for the game went on to produce Total Carnage, a game that maintained the same control style and applied it to a vertical scrolling world, similar to Ikari Warriors or Mercs.

At the beginning of the game the player chooses between the King's son, Brodan, or the King's daughter, Shardan. This does not change the gameplay. The character's design are heavily inspired by Golden Axe and the works of Robert E. Howard. The prince and princess will travel all over their kingdom from the city gates to zombie graveyards in their quest to take their kingdom back.  </div>  <div> Gameplay (Genesis Version) : The goal is to go from left to right, killing everyone. The protagonist can jump, do horizontal and vertical strikes and crouch. There are four different kinds of strikes (horizontal, vertical, jump and a crouch strike) each are more effective against certain enemy types. However the most effective move is the crouch strike as it is the only way to hit an enemy without getting hit back.When enemies double up from the same direction, attacks hurt the one in front but not the one behind. Enemies can go through the player character and attack from both sides. An enemy's health is portrayed right beneath them and dead enemies sometimes drop potions. There are different types of enemies found during the quest such as soldiers, giants and zombies. Each must be killed in a different way. For the giants, they need two vertical strikes at close range then when his health is down to fifty percent the player must back up and hit him again with vertical strikes. For zombies, when killed, deadly fire balls start spinning around them. The protagonist can pick up potions during their quest. Some potions give more health and some can be combined. For example, combining four white potions allows the player to automatically skip a level. The game was also known for its violence. This game was released a couple years before Mortal Kombat and seeing blood and decapitations on-screen was relatively new at the time. </div> "

Syd of Valis,Telenet Japan,Telenet JapanRenovation Products,April 1992[16],genesis,"Valis SD, known in the U.S. as Syd of Valis, is a retelling of the events of Valis 2 in SD form.

The game overall is closer to the PC Engine incarnation of Valis II, but it has many aspects of the home computer versions, including the ability to switch between outfits and weapons via a pause menu screen. It also injects a fair amount of silliness in the game, but that's only to be expected with the super-deformed style.Most stages have mini-bosses in them, in addition to a stage-ending boss. Yuko is capable of moving in several directions and jumping, as is typical. However, the game has several play elements that are not present in other Valis games. Yuko is capable of firing both up and down in addition to left and right, an ability only found in this game in terms of the Valis series; She can also double jump and has bombs which clear the screen of small enemies, or deal damage to major enemies. </div>  <div> Story : Yuko isn't happy! Yuko is interrupted from eating an important pudding by the ghost of Reiko, who tells her she is needed again to save Vecanti (and potentially the real world) from a new King named Megas. Despite her protests, Yuko is dragged away and doesn't get to finish her pudding. Along the way she'll pick up many items and weapons to help her defeat Megas' forces. The storyline is slightly simplified compared to Valis II, with the elimination of the Rogures loyalist forces from the storyline. Everyone simply works for Megas!  </div> "

Syndicate,Bullfrog Productions,Electronic Arts,December 1994,genesis,"Syndicate is a reinvention of the 1993 game by Bullfrog. Developed at Starbreeze Studios, the game puts players in the shoes of Miles Kilo, one of the cybernetically-enhanced Agents who wages war against enemy mega-corporations on behalf of EuroCorp, his sponsor syndicate.",3030-30734,30734,0,2012-02-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/syndicate/3030-30734/,PEGI: 18+," <div> Overview : Developed by Starbreeze and published by EA, Syndicate is a fast-paced first-person shooter, taking place in the same dystopian cyberpunk future originally conceived by Bullfrog in their 1993 isometric real-time tactical game by the same name. Set in 2069 (as opposed to the 2096 of the Bullfrog release), the campaign is seen through the eyes of Miles Kilo.Despite favourable reviews, EA announced that Syndicate had failed to meet expectations commercially and did not turn a profit. </div>  <div> Story : Syndicate takes place in a future where corporations (also referred to as Syndicates) have grown tremendously powerful, replacing the governments of the world. They lean heavily on advancing the capabilities of the DART chip, a microchip implanted in the skull of 57% of the world population that allows enhanced interactivity with the surrounding world. Each corporation has weaponized the chip, allowing for enhanced senses and physical abilities, as well as the ability to hack in to other chips to varying degrees with diverse effects.Drawl, Merit and Denham talking serious businessExperimental versions of these chips are placed in 'Agents', assets utilized by the corporations to further their agendas through a mix of subterfuge, sabotage and aggression. With each company trying to gain the upper hand over their competition, corporate espionage runs rampant, paranoia is innate, and tensions have reached a boiling point between the three largest Syndicates of the world: EuroCorp, Aspari, and Cayman Global.The campaign follows the story of Agent Miles Kilo, primary test subject for Dr. Lily Drawl's (voiced by Rosario Dawson) prototype DART-6 chip, his partner Agent Jules Merit (voiced by Michael Wincott), CEO of EuroCorp Jack Denham (voiced by Brian Cox), and the fall of EuroCorp. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Syndicate's gameplay focuses on combining shooting and melee executions with skillful use of the DART chip's abilities. The single player campaign and the multiplayer co-operative mode share many fundamentals, but end up playing fairly differently. In both modes, your use of applications are limited by your ability to produce adrenaline. Scoring and chaining together kills, completing objectives and performing ""breach spikes"", essentially an active reload, will all produce adrenaline, recharging your applications.The DART Overlay in actionThe campaign provides access to four key abilities:DART Overlay: Slows down time and highlights targets in the environment, even behind cover. With upgrades, it can mitigate damage, increase health regeneration, and increase damage output.Backfire App: This application causes the gun of an enemy to misfire, initially affecting two targets, but can be upgraded to three. Those effected suffer a small amount of damage from the initial blast and are susceptible to increase damage.Suicide App: This application disrupts DART chips' regular functions, causing the effected target to pull out a grenade and commit suicide.Persuade App: A throwback of sorts to the original Syndicate, this application causes a target to switch sides and fight alongside you. In the event that all enemies are eliminated, the target will turn the gun on themselves.The ability to ""breach"", or hack, in to enemy chips and the environment around you plays an integral part in gameplay as well. Several enemies will sport armor types that negate all damage until they are hacked, and often times progress through a level will be hindered until a computer terminal, control switch, etc. is hacked to open up the pathway.The game also consists of a four player cooperative mode that follows the loose story of up and coming Syndicate, Wulf Western and it's agents: Akuma, Thalos, Fall and Darius. Players are able to create different loadouts, making weapon and application combinations that all them to potentially fill a team archetype, e.g. Tank, Healer, etc. Because the multiplayer is not competitive based, there is no Online Pass required by EA to access the multiplayer content. </div>  <div> Co-operative Mechanics : The co-operative mode in Syndicate is designed for 4 players but skilled players can tackle the missions solo or in pairs and still have great success in earning experience. Any experience earned will be lost if a player does not finish a given mission so be sure to keep that in mind if you need to leave a game in progress. The experience earned goes towards player rank, weapon upgrades and application research. Each rank provides points which can be spent in a skill tree to increase the attributes of the player, such as faster breach speed, increased health, the ability to equip two applications at once and even temporary invulnerability when near death.Each mission can be played on one of three difficulties: Normal, Hard and Expert with each jump providing stronger enemy types and more of them to deal with. Usually this includes more of the armored enemies that usually require focused teamwork to take down. During the higher difficulties it will be more likely that a player is put into a downed state and thus will need a ""reboot"". During the initial downed phase a player may move around, albeit very slowly, and attempt to get close to an active player to be ""rebooted"". If any more damage is sustained the player will drop to their knees and a longer reboot will be needed.Two main types of mission objectives are employed in co-op. One will require you to perform combat sweeps of a given area / facility and eliminate any hostiles found within. The second will task you with retrieving items of value / interest and delivering them safely to a waiting dropship.After a mission is beaten on a specific difficulty the player will earn application research tokens which allow for the improvement of the abilities that can be equipped before entering a mission. Each application can be improved 4 times from the base effect. The player can choose which upgrade will receive priority if mulitple research projects are unlocked and a single project can be queued to earn experience after the main designation is complete. If the designated and queued research finish during a mission then any further unlocked projects will receive research in a sequential fashion until a priority is chosen by the player.The armored enemies carry powerful weapons and are immune to most forms of damage until their armor is breached or bypassed by the player agents. Once a breach occurs a layer of the armor is weakened and the players have a set amount of time to destroy it and damage the health of the enemy. The strongest type of enemy has 3 layers to breach and on the third breach they are disabled allowing the players to remove their chips.Agent Fall getting his chip rip onRemoving a chip from a downed elite soldier will unlock blueprint tokens that will allow players to unlock upgrade paths for weapons and start to designate earned experience towards unlocking the upgrades. Experience continues to accrue towards ranks but now also goes towards unlocking scopes, silencers and other upgrades for each weapon in the game. This research can be designated and queued in an identical fashion to application research.The player can edit and save 3 distinct loadouts consisting of a main weapon, sidearm and one (or two) applications. The weapons available are of a limited selection and many must be found within missions. Any upgrades applied to these retrieved weapons will apply upon picking them up during the mission. The dropped weapons can include a Thermite gun ( flamethrower ), Rocket launcher, Minigun and more. The more powerful weapons can not be refilled at the ammo crates that dot the mission layout.The applications that can be taken into the co-op mode are generally unique to the co-op apart from Backfire, which appears in the main campaign. There are 12 applications in total:Backfire: Hacks enemy weapons and makes their ammo explode, forcing them to the ground and making them more vulnerable to damage for a time.Focus Target: Highlights a target and increases damage done on the hacked target by a given amount.Battery: Recharges fellow agents applications a given amount but can not be used to refill another application of Battery.Focus Breach: Decreases breach time for all fellow agents.E-Drain: Damages enemies and converts that damage into health for the player.C2C Pulse: Healing waves pulse from the player, healing anyone near to them by a given amount.Reboot: Allows a player to revive themselves from a downed state.Damage Link: Increases weapon damage of all players for a time.Shielding: Provides a temporary shield to all players that absorbs a set amount of damage.EMP: Releases an EMP charge around the player that can stun enemies and disable turrets and UAVs.Squad Heal: Heals all players by a set amount.Virus: Infects enemies with a damage over time effect that can even penetrate armored enemies without breaching first.Before entering any mission a player may form or join a player created Syndicate. This is the clan system of the game and brings bonuses to the player in the form of increased experience from healing and rebooting fellow Syndicate members during missions.The game ships with 9 maps, that are billed as ""reimaginings"" of some the original Syndicate's mission: Western Europe, Mozambique, Atlantic Accelerator, Colorado, China, Scandinavia, Northern Territories, Argentina and New England. </div>  <div> Development : EA's Jeff Gamon has stated that,""Fans of the franchise will recognize many weapons and environments in the game, but in a whole new way. The game also provides a separate and deep 4-player co-op mode featuring missions from the original cult classic, which adds another layer of depth to the overall experience."" </div>  <div> PC System Requirements : HardwareMinimumRecommendedProcessorIntel Core 2 Duo (E4600) at 2.4 Ghz or equivalent (Athlon 64 X2) processorCore 2 Quad Q6400 2.13GHz or Athlon II X3 440Video CardATI Radeon HD 4650 or NVIDIA GeForce 8800 GT (min. 512mb RAM) or betterGeForce GT 545 DDR5 or Radeon HD 4850OSWindows XP with SP2, Windows Vista, Windows 7Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7HDD10.5 GB12 GBMemory2 GB Windows 7 & Windows XP (3 GB with Windows Vista)4 GB </div>  <div> External links : Official websiteSyndicate Wiki </div> "

It's also known for having the attack buttons corresponding to specific limbs (a mechanic later used in the Tekken series).It is one of the few action-oriented arcade games from Incredible Technologies (who went on to make sports-oriented arcade games, primarily the Golden Tee Golf series). After the game's release, they would soon develop the game's spiritual sequel: BloodStorm.The Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis were intended to receive ports of the game by THQ subsidiary Black Pearl at late 1993, but were shelved. The Sega Genesis version would later receive a release in July 1996 as part of THQ's ""Arcade Classics"" series. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Time Killers plays like a traditional fighting game with five attack buttons. Unlike other games of the era, each button represents a limb of the character's body at the perspective towards the play screen: Head, Front Arm, Back Arm, Front Leg, and Back Leg. Pressing both Arm buttons or both Kick buttons simultaneously give stronger Arm and Kick attacks. Blocking can be done by either holding back on the joystick or by holding down both Back buttons simultaneously.If enough damage is dealt to a character's arm, that arm would be cut cleanly from the character's body and most attacks using that arm's corresponding button would be futile. In rare occasions, both arms can be cut off in the same round. If the player wins the round with no arms, they receive an ""ARMLESS WIN"".Players can prematurely end the round if they decapitate their opponent character's head using a special ""Death Move"", which can be done by pressing all five attack buttons simultaneously. If the enemy character is dizzied after a barrage of successful attacks, the player can use the ""Death Move"" at close range for a special variant of the attack (with a flourish that also dismembers the opponent's character). </div>  <div> Characters : The game includes eight playable characters from various time periods, each with their own backstory (which were only included in the game's handbook and the manual of the Genesis version). After defeating all eight characters, the player confronts the unplayable final boss: Death himself.Thugg - A primitive caveman from the stone age (circa 20,000 B.C.) who wields a stone axe in battle. In his backstory, Thugg has previously led a fierce war against an alien race known as the Troglodytes, who had been enslaving humanity for centuries.Leif - An adventurous viking during the Nordic conquest (circa 829 A.D.) who wields a large battle axe in battle.

In his backstory, Rancid was a streetwise loner who was framed for a series of crimes known as the ""X Murders"", surviving a fatal battle with the true killer.Orion - A legendary outlaw from the Last Frontier (circa 2885 A.D.) who wields an electric saber in battle. In his backstory, Orion was an aspiring space traveler who was on the run from authorities after finding his space station home was attacked by mysterious shadow creatures (which he confronted).Matrix - A cybernetic soldier from a terraformed Mars colony (circa 3297 A.D.) who wields both a photon blade and her bionic arm in battle. In her backstory, Matrix grew up in (and later ended) the Cyber Wars after a mysterious force reprogrammed all A.I. to go berserk and destroy humanity.Mantazz - A savage creature (resembling a mantis) from an alien-invaded Earth (circa 4002 A.D.) who wields her serrated forearms in battle. In her backstory, Mantazz is the queen of the Mantazz race who was leading an overwhelming destruction of humanity.

Todd's Adventures in Slime World,Micro World,Micro WorldJPRenovation ProductsNA,September 1992[32],genesis,"Todd's Adventures in Slime World is one of Atari Lynx most notable games, featuring extremely varied gameplay and a large-scale multiplayer (8 players) for the time it was released.",3030-2741,2741,0,,https://www.giantbomb.com/todds-adventures-in-slime-world/3030-2741/,," <div> Overview : Todd's Adventures in Slime World is a side-scrolling platform game for the Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis video game systems. Designed by M. Peter Engelbrite, who also created the Lynx classic Gates of Zendocon and a number of Atari 2600 titles, it is notable for containing an early example of a large-scale multiplayer combat game (the Lynx version allows up to eight people to play against each other), for having extremely varied gameplay, for being a side-scroller with a useful automap system before Super Metroid, and for teasing players with its vast number of secret areas.Players in Slime World are armed with a water cannon that can be fired at many angles and can kill most enemies in one hit, and they can also cling to and climb most walls, as well as perform high and long jumps. Although nominally an action game, many rooms require excellent knowledge of the player's abilities and can only be navigated in certain ways, frequently giving it an air of a puzzle game.The design of Slime World is especially unique for its use of carefully moderated levels of danger. A player can sustain ordinary damage from many sources, and it adds up quickly, but there are also common invulnerability shields and pools of water that remove all damage taken when used. But there are also red enemies that, when shot, result in a spray of red slime that can instantly kill even a shielded player, creating circumstances when it is best not to shoot foes.There is also a type of enemy called a Hidden Snapper, that instantly kills players that step over it. Snappers are often undetectable until triggered, and instantly fatal if set off. Canny players, however, may often detect subtle design cues left in the world by the designer, and safely jump over the lethal spots of ground. Players (usually) have infinite lives to explore the world, but lose all their inventory items and are also sent back to the last checkpoint arrow passed. </div>  <div> Levels : The game contains seven ""levels"" that are more akin to game variations, each possessing not just its own map but its own variation on the basic rules. The variations are:Easy: A relatively simple mode with little red slime or snapjaws, good for learning the game.Exploration: Players are given a huge map with a great number of secret passages, and many enemies.Action: The hardest level in terms of enemy opposition.Logic: A slower-paced, solo-only mode in which the water gun doesn't work. Players must instead avoid, dodge or outrun foes, or find other ways of defeating them like mega bombs. While checkpoint arrows work, everything else in the world is reset when Todd dies.Suspense: The player is given a severe time limit within which to escape Slime World. It starts at 3 minutes, but it can be extended by one minute for each mushroom collected. While the route to the exit is mostly linear, there are a number of false routes to confound players.Combat: Most of the modes can be played cooperatively, but this one is competitive. Everyone gets five lives, and the last player in the game wins. Players may find slime guns to replace their water guns, that are capable of directly harming the other players. There are also other weapons to use, with room-destroying mega bombs at the top of the list. The Combat map is also just as packed with environmental dangers as the other modes.Arcade: The greatest challenge of Slime World, in this mode the map is almost as dangerous as Action, but the checkpoint arrows don't work. While the map is shorter than some of the other modes, it's still fairly substantial, and the player must start over from the beginning every time a life is lost. In the Lynx version of the game, there is a second, secret exit from the map that, if found, gives the player an address to write to at Epyx Games for a special reward. </div>  <div> Items : The items in the game are:Slime Gem: Very common items that award a large score bonus and also heal the player a bit.Red Slime Gem: Rarer bonus item that awards a tremendous number of points, completely heals the player and gives him an invincibility shield for a while, but if accidentally shot, pops in a spray of deadly red slime.Triple Shot: Upgrades the water gun to fire three streams of water, useful for tough foes and crowded rooms.Slime Gun: Changes the player's ammo to slime, capable of harming the other players instead of cleaning them off. Strangely, the many slime monsters of the game are still killed by it.Shield: Makes the player invulnerable to slime for a limited period and completely heals all damage, but provides no protection against red slime or Snappers. (It does protect against red monsters, though.)Cleanser: Permanently turns a pool of normal, damaging slime into pure water, capable of healing the player.Enemy Bait: Draws enemies in the room to its location, where they are killed automatically. Doesn't work on some monsters, and red monsters still burst in a spray of red slime when killed in this way.Mega Bomb: When used, is thrown onto the ground a short distance in front of the player, waits a few seconds, then destroys everything in its room in a gigantic explosion. While the explosion doesn't work on Hidden Snappers (since they lurk in the ground, not in the room), everything else in the game can be destroyed by bombs: monsters, players, items, pools of slime and water, and even checkpoint arrows.Jet Pack: Gives the player the ability to fly for a limited time. Players cannot fire while flying, and pools are incredibly dangerous while using a Jet Pack, causing an explosion like a Mega Bomb if one is flown into liquid. </div> "

It is regarded as the most competitive game in the Mortal Kombat franchise (prior to its 2011 reboot). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as Mortal Kombat Trilogy).In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm). </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a ""Run Meter"", which limits their ability to run forward, and ""chain combos"", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.BRUTALITY!Fatalities, Friendships, Babalities, Mercy, and Animalities return from Mortal Kombat 3. However, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions sacrificed Mercy and Animalities for a new type of finishing move: Brutalities. Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in Mortal Kombat), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The ""Choose Your Destiny"" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each ""tower"". Additionally, there is a ""Master II"" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the ""tower"" while making the game more difficult.More ""Kombat Kodes"", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three ""Ultimate Kombat Kodes"", ten-digit codes that are entered during the Game Over screen, with three new characters to unlock. The Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection removed Kombat Kodes from the online component in the game. </div>  <div> Characters : Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 also includes three gameplay modes, each requiring a different amount of credits to start:Mortal Kombat - Traditional game mode with one-on-one fights.4 Player 2-on-2 Kombat - A multiplayer tag-team fight in similar vein to Endurance Matches.8 Player Tournament - A single-elimination tournament for eight players. </div>  <div> Arenas : New to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is the concept of Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures, in which completing the game gives the player a choice between a group of bonuses ranging from battling secret characters to watching a demonstration of each Fatality in the game. These groups are restricted by the difficulty the game was completed on. 8-Player Tournament mode also gives the player access to Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures at the end.Novice Difficulty and higherShows the character's endingPlay a clone of Galaga (only previously accessible through a Kombat Kode or reaching 100 battles)Battle with ErmacBattle with Noob SaibotWarrior Difficulty and higherRandom TreasureFatality Demonstration #1Fatality Demonstration #2Fatality Demonstration #3Endurance Match against Noob Saibot and ErmacMaster Difficulty and higherEndurance Match against masked Sub-Zero and Noob SaibotEndurance Match against Noob Saibot, Ermac, human Smoke, masked Sub-Zero, and MileenaMaster II DifficultySupreme Demonstration (shows most Fatalities, Babalities, Friendships, and Animalities) </div>  <div> Versions & Ports : The 22 playable characters (including the three unlockable characters)The game includes 19 playable starting characters, two unplayable bosses, four playable secret characters, and one unplayable secret opponent.

A pre-indoctrinated version of Smoke, known as Human Smoke, is playable by holding a special button combination when choosing the robotic Smoke.Noob Saibot is still a hidden, unplayable opponent. However, because of the inclusion of masked male ninjas, he is no longer a palette swap of Kano (except in the Sega Saturn version). Featured in the game's opening gameplay montage is Rain, a dark purple palette swap of the male ninjas that serves as nothing more as a fake hidden character for stirring up rumors.

Cham comes and attempts to steal the Valis sword as Yuko sleeps to avenge her murdered father... what will Yuko do? </div>  <div> Gameplay : Incorporating the familiar action platforming style found in Castlevania, as well as previous Valis games, the player must navigate each stage to find and defeat the boss of that level. In addition to the usual jump and attack, Valis III introduces a sliding maneuver for the characters as well. Characters can also ""high jump"" by holding up during a jump. Yuko, Valna and Cham can each be selected at will for their appropriate skills (some levels cannot be completed without using Valna’s magic, for example).Yuko's ice cutter.A weapon gauge displays the current power of the player’s weapons, and power up icons can be collected during play to increase that level. The weapon power bar refills over time, and the more full the bar is the stronger the attack; thusly, attacking rapidly is much weaker than allowing the attack to charge and then striking. Magical attack power ups take the form of Fire, Ice and Thunder, which are shared by all three characters, but each with different results.

Yuko and Cham must traverse a mountain pass, fighting past scorpion men and other bizarre creatures on the way. On the path several wounded soldiers inform them Vanity Castle has been taken and Valna has been imprisoned. A devilish winged soldier of Grames awaits at the top of a waterfall for our heroines.Stage 3: A spooky forest on the way to the tower were Valna is held! Our heroines are immediately assaulted by invisible soldiers and chomping jaws. A mysterious ferryman offers to take the girls across the lake, but he can only take one at a time...fishmen assault whoever was chosen on the way, but wait! It was all a trap, and the ferryman is the boss. He transforms in to a rather weak serpent.Stage 4: The tower where Valna is held! Yuko (or Cham, as they're still separated) must scale the tower and fight off the various guards. Valna is imprisoned in a crystal at the top! After freeing her, Valna must fight the stage boss, the fire devil Koriranba, on her own.Stage 5: Yuko and co. head to the sacred place called Sazarland to meet with Nizetti, who (according to Valna) can unlock the true power of the Valis sword. Probably the most infamous stage in the game, heavy usage of Valna's death cube magic is vital to pass the stage. At the end, a bell must be rung a number of times to prove the hero is worthy to enter Sazarland!The coinage of the Gods.Stage 6: After proving themselves worthy, our heroines must test their resolve by climbing Nirvan Road, a path which leads to the heavens. Along the way, Yuko encounters the spirits of some of her departed comrades (I.E., Reiko and Valia) Yuko must face an onslaught of soldiers to test her bravery!The horror!Stage 7: King Grames dispatches his generals to dispose of Yuko! Arriving in the Grames' devil world, our heroines traverse a frightful graveyard, populated by typically graveyard-esque denizens. Flying bloody crosses attempt to impale our protagonists, and huge mounds of bones are a testament to the terrible rule of Grames. Rogures awaits Yuko at the end, eager for revenge! He's not afraid to use some of his same old tricks, but he also has a newfound fondness for knives!Stage 8: Continuing on their way, Yuko and co. pass through a desert full of the remains of long-dead giant creatures. Of course, no video game desert is complete with giant ant lions and sand dwelling fish! Zalude awaits at the end to attack our heroines with an array of saw blades and a mighty shoulder tackle!Stage 9: Next stop, an icy cave! Flying ammonites float casually though the air, and ice-men hurl themselves suicidally at our ladies in an all-out effort to stop their advances. Asura waits at the end of the caves, eager to prove his beauty and strength. He teleports and leaps about, hurling a variety of projectiles as he does so.The tower of King Grames.Stage 10: Grames hasn't been sitting idly by during all this; he's invaded the human world! His foreboding tower has sprung up in the middle of Tokyo; it's time for Yuko and friends to make a final stand, scale his tower and take him down! Grames will be the toughest opponent Yuko has ever faced; she'd better be ready! He's capable of everything Yuko can do, and more!We'll miss you, Yuko!Nevertheless, Grames falls before Yuko's sword; for her long and hard work, Yuko ascends to Godhood in the ending. Thusly a new path opens for the people of the devil world and the people of the dreamworld Vecanti to co-exist peacefully. </div>  <div> Critical Reception : When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 8,8,7,8 stating, ""...this is the best of the Valis trilogy yet!"" </div> "

The arcade version served as the debut for the Sega Model 1 board, the first in the popular Sega Model series of arcade system boards, and thus Virtua Racing is often seen as the start of the 1990s 3D gaming revolution.Utilizing a dedicated 3D graphics board (much like Namco's System 21), the Sega Model 1 was the most powerful gaming system up until that time, with polygon rendering capabilities and floating-point performance far beyond what other gaming systems at the time were capable of. It was also the first arcade game to represent human characters, though these early human character models looked dated after Virtua Fighter released in 1993.In early 1992, Sega intended to add texture-mapping to the Model 1 system, but were unable to do at the time; they later succeeded in adding filtered texture-mapping to the Sega Model 2 arcade system by late 1993, beginning with Daytona USA, a spiritual successor to Virtua Racing. </div>  <div> Deluxe arcade cabinets : There was a Deluxe version, known as the V.R. DX cabinet type, which is a single-player machine and has a 16:9 aspect-ratio monitor (the first use of a widescreen aspect ratio monitor in a video game), and 6 airbags (3 on each side) built into the seat that will inflate and ""nudge"" the player when cornering, and one more airbag on the player's back that inflates under braking. The seat is also adjustable via ""forward"" and ""back"" buttons using air pressure. V.R. DX's force-feedback steering also uses two pneumatic cylinders to rotate the steering wheel, which differ from the electric motor-and-clutch system that the upright and twin versions use (which have no inbuilt air system), so the steering feel is quite different. </div>  <div> Sega Model 1 arcade hardware : A special deluxe cabinet of Virtua Racing was released, called Virtua Formula. At the time, this deluxe cabinet was very expensive (in the UK, for example, it cost as much as £250,000 for the cabinet and £3 per play).This deluxe cabinet featured 4-8 Formula 1 race car replicas, each one with its own large monitor and with the controls in the car corresponding to actions in the game.

The tennis players have three attributes (Speed, Power, and Skill) and are divided into three classes (Ground Stroker, All Rounder, and Net Player). There is a total of 16 players in this game, supposedly all male. Since the game only gives their surnames and no gender, this topic is open for debate. In the game itself, they are differentiated only by the color of their clothing.Pointless, he is notThe game offers three types of floor. A looped animation of a bouncing ball allows the player to gauge the effect on the gameplay beforehand. Lawn is the fastest of the three, Hard is neutral, and Clay slows down the ball. The impact on the gameplay is quite noticeable.Speaking of options, there are two basic modes. The Tour Mode is a series of bracket-based tournaments. You get to create your own tennis player in this mode, but aside from the name and the three stats there is no further customization. There are no difficulty levels per se, but the game gets progressively harder. This is also a pure single player experience, so doubling up with another player in Tour Mode is not possible. There is also the Free Match Mode which offers all kinds of singles and doubles. The CPU can fill out all slots and is actually not that bad of a double partner.It's tennis, all rightOne thing that can be said about the gameplay itself is that it's really, really fast. The players are zipping about at incredible speeds, making this a somewhat frantic tennis game. The two action buttons correspond to a lob and a normal shot respectively. As with any tennis game, positioning is key. In this case, it's a little harder because you can overshoot the ball quite easily, given the absurd running speed. </div> "

It is known for its unique premise (a fighting game based on historical figures), its simplistic control scheme (two basic attack buttons, which can be held down for stronger attacks, and a dedicated ""throw"" button), and its ""Death Match"" mode (an optional game mode where each arena has a variety of obstacles. It received three sequels throughout the early '90s.Along with a release for the Neo Geo AES (on September 11, 1992), the game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (by Sunsoft on September 1993) and to the Sega Genesis (exclusively in North America by Sega on July 1994). It was also ported to the Neo Geo CD (with an arranged soundtrack) on March 17, 1995. The original game was digitally re-released by D4 for the Wii (via Virtual Console) on September 28, 2007 and by HAMSTER (as part of the Arcade Archives series) for the PlayStation 4 (on January 26, 2017) and Xbox One (on February 23, 2017). It was also included in the 2008  World Heroes Anthology compilation for the  PlayStation 2 and is an unlockable game in the  SNK Arcade Classics V.1 compilation for the PlayStation 2,  PlayStation Portable, and Wii. </div>  <div> Gameplay : World Heroes plays like a traditional 2D fighter. Along with two standard attack buttons (one for punches, one for kicks), the game features a dedicated button for throwing (making the character vulnerable if they whiff the throw).Holding down either the Punch or Kick buttons makes the attack stronger, while simply tapping the button gives a quick strike. This can be modified in the SNES version so that each attack strength is its own dedicated button (making the controls more responsive). </div>  <div> Characters : Inspired by the growing popularity of hardcore wrestling in Japan, Death Match is an optional game mode that pits both fighters in a wrestling ring with one or more traps:Wall Traps - All three traps function the same: touching both edges of the arena cause the player character to become damaged and knocked away towards the center of the arena. High Energy stages, where the ropes are electrified, are used in Hanzo's, Rasputin's, and Geegus's stages. Needle stages, where both sides of the arena have spiked walls, are used in Brocken's and Fuuma's stages. The Fire stage, where the ropes are on fire, is used in J. Carn's stage.Floor Traps - The floor may be covered in one of two traps: Oil (slippery puddles that slide characters around as they enter it) and Minefield (which periodically spawn exploding mines at the feet of each character, causing damage and knockdown). Oil stages are used in Dragon's, Fuuma's, and Rasputin's stages. Minefield stages are used in M. Power's and Geegus's stages.Instead of traps, Janne's stage is ""Hair Splitting"", which means that the losing character must shave their head (as shown in the post-match versus screen). Regardless, all stages use the same music (as opposed to the regular mode, where each stage has their own music). </div> "

While preparing for a magic show, both Mickey and Donald encounter a mysterious magic box and enter it, which transports them into a mysterious magical world ruled by a powerful magician.While players can progress through the game solo as either Mickey or Donald, with Mickey having access to alternate routes by crawling through small passageways, the game supports two-player co-operative multiplayer with one as Mickey and one as Donald. In two-player games, both players can reach new areas by stacking on top of each other and calling down a rope.The game was later included in the North American and European versions of the 2019 Sega Genesis Mini microconsole. </div>  <div> Gameplay : World of Illusion is a standard platformer game; Mickey and Donald can run, jump and attack enemies using their capes (which turns them into harmless animals or objects, such as a dove or a playing card, though it varies by enemy). A new magic spell is learned by defeating the boss of each level, allowing the pair to advance to and progress through the next level.This game features the, at the time, popular password save system, but instead of using a combination letters and numbers, the player selects from the 4 different suites in a deck of cards to continue.One feature that was unique at the time was how levels changed slightly depending on if the player chose a single-player game with Mickey or Donald, or if they chose the two-player game. For example, in the two-player mode, Mickey and Donald would have to support each other to get through the level by jumping on each other to reach high places, then using a rope to hoist up the person who one who was used as a stepping stone, or through Mickey pulling Donald through tight crawlspaces, as he couldn't fit through them, although this would cause structural damage to the area and end up changing part of the next stage. This also affects the single-player mode, as Mickey could fit through the crawlspaces with ease, however Donald would have to find another way around. </div> "

THQ released a title with phenomenal visuals and an impressive amount of customization for your entrance. They even attempt to mimic the camera angles popularized on the RAW broadcast, so you'll see the action from a long list of unusual perspectives.It also had a fairly unique game mechanic in that a health meter is replaced with a popularity meter. If the crowd is really behind somebody, you won't be able to pin them, which makes it vital that one really beats down on their opponent to win. You have to work an offense based on this, so spamming a certain move actually backfires as if you do a certain move repeatedly, the audience will cease responding to it and it will end up not doing much to actually defeat the opponent. If the man is pinnable and you do not pin them, the crowd will turn on you as well. Obviously, the more popular the wrestler (such as Rock), the more difficult it is to defeat them. It is possible, but it is quite difficult. The reversal engine is based primarily on timing button presses.The grappling engine seems to borrow, somewhat, from THQ's UFC titles of that era. The grappling engine hit a medium between the No Mercy and Smackdown series.There is no appreciable storyline in the game, something that had started appearing in wrestling games at about that point. The matches also tended to run fairly long. 15 minute or more matches are not all that unusual in WWF RAW, making quick pick-up-and-play sessions a bit of a challenge to pull off. And while the customization in your entrance is very in-depth, the customization of your characters appearance and moveset is far less in-depth. There is also no real weight classification. Anybody can do all of their moves to anybody else, no matter the size difference. Women wrestlers can bodyslam The Undertaker without a problem, for example. </div>  <div> Roster : Al SnowAlbertThe Big ShowBilly GunBradshawBubba Ray DudleyChris BenoitChris JerichoChristianCrash HollyD-Von DudleyEddie GuerreroEdgeFaarooqFunakiHakuHardcore HollyIvoryJeff HardyJustin CredibleK-KwikKaneKurt AngleLitaMatt HardyMolly HollyPerry SaturnRavenRhinoRikishiThe RockSpike DudleySteve AustinSteve BlackmanTajiriTAKA MichinokuTazzTestTriple HThe Blue MeanieTrish StratusThe UndertakerVince McMahonWilliam RegalX-PacShane McMahonStephanie McMahon-HelmsleyFred Durst </div> "

It is the first console 3D wrestling game to allow more than four wrestlers on screen simultaneously; it allows nine.,3030-28430,28430,0,2000-08-15,https://www.giantbomb.com/wwf-royal-rumble/3030-28430/,ESRB: T," <div> Overview : WWF Royal Rumble is a professional wrestling video game that was made specifically for arcades and released in summer 2000. The game's title is based around the  WWF's yearly pay-per-view event of the same name. This was  THQ's 3rd effort under the World Wrestling Federation banner since signing a 10-year contract to make WWF (which became World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002) games. Despite being created for arcades, a console port for the  Sega Dreamcast was created and released to stores in North America on August 15, 2000, a few weeks after the machines were sent out to arcades. A European version was released for the Dreamcast on September 22, 2000. A Japanese version was released for the Dreamcast on April 26, 2001. Yuke's developed both versions, though publishing rights were split.  Sega published the arcade version while THQ published the Dreamcast version. The arcade version ran on the Sega NAOMI hardware. The arcade cabinet had a dual monitor design to allow up to four players to play simultaneously; two on one screen, two on another. The Dreamcast version also allowed for four simultaneous players.   </div>  <div> Gameplay : WWF Royal Rumble was a ground-breaking wrestling game in terms of technical capability. Previously, wrestling games in the  PlayStation/ Nintendo 64 era had been limited to only being able to allow four wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble more than doubled this amount. Running on the Sega NAOMI hardware, it allows up to nine wrestlers to be on screen at the same time. While not so eye-opening for an arcade game, the Dreamcast (which contained hardware very similar to Sega NAOMI) very impressively was able to replicate the arcade's ability to allow nine wrestlers on screen at once. Royal Rumble was the first console wrestling game in the 3D era to break the barrier of having more than four wrestlers on screen at the same time. Beyond that though, there wasn't much else to the game. At a time when console wrestling games and technology were heavily evolving to allow some of the more iconic gimmick matches of the 90s to be simulated in a video game, such as the cage match and the ladder match, many were excited to see what the Dreamcast would be capable of. However, THQ decided to make the Dreamcast version a straight port of the arcade version. Thus, it was critically panned due to its lack of game modes and small roster of WWF wrestlers compared to other games that had already been on the market for months, such as  WWF WrestleMania 2000 for the Nintendo 64 and  WWF SmackDown! for the Sony PlayStation.  </div>  <div> Playable Roster : The only two modes in the game are Exhibition and Royal Rumble. In Exhibition mode, the player chooses a wrestler to play as in a series of singles matches only. He or she is also given the option to select a partner of sorts, despite only being able to wrestle singles matches. The partner is used for selective interference at the command of the player. In singles matches, if the match is nearing the time limit, the ring will fade from the background and the wrestlers will be transferred to a backstage area, such as a kitchen, a boiler room, or a parking lot.In Royal Rumble mode, the mode is patterned around the yearly event but is not directly replicated. Instead of merely surviving, you must be active in eliminating people. You begin the match as your selected character. You have a three-minute timer on the screen. The object is to not get eliminated or let the timer run out. An elimination requires being thrown over the top rope and hitting the floor with both feet. Eliminating wrestlers adds 20 seconds to the clock. Eliminating a wrestler with a ""S"" near their feet will add 40 seconds to the clock. In the arcade version, if you get eliminated or the timer runs out, you must insert a credit to continue. In the Dreamcast version, you merely press start to continue. This mode is where the small roster becomes noticeable, as you'll see a handful of wrestlers reappear later in the match. The match requires 30 wrestlers and there are only 19 or 21 wrestlers, depending on the version you are playing. Up to nine wrestlers can be in the ring at one time in this mode.  </div> "

It is also possible to Run by pressing Light Punch and Light Kick together.The main game consists of the player choosing to go after the Intercontinental title or the World Wrestling Federation Title. In the Intercontinental Title challenge, the chosen wrestler will face four opponents via one-on-one matches, followed by two two-on-one matches, and finally a three-on-one match. In the WWF Title Challenge, the player will start out with four two-on-one matches, moving on to two three-on-one matches, and finally the ""Wrestlemania Challenge"", a gauntlet match against every wrestler in the game. In the final match, however, only four people (including the player character) will be in the ring at once. Once an opponent is eliminated, someone will replace them until all eight opponents have been beaten.Each character has a unique ending.The only known ""finishing move"", similar to a Fatality, is done by the Undertaker.

Each X-man represented in the center of the playfield has a corresponding mode, started by consecutive shots:Beast (left loop): Shoot past Wolverine to make the loop shot twice to start beast. Make additional loop/pop bumper shots to transform Henry McCoy from human to beast formWolverine (Bash toy): Hit wolverine a set number of times to start weapon X multiball. Alternate flashing shots to escape the facility (wolverine and just about any other lit shot)Storm: Hit the side ramp, and then shoot either cyclops or storm again to complete. Pop bumpers also appear to score in this mode.Rogue: Shoot the left inner loop twice to start Rogue. All hero shots are lit (including Nightcrawler). Hit at least two to steal the X-men's powers and complete the mode.Professor X (VUK): Shoot the Xavier shot twice to start ""find the mutant"". A silhouette on the DMD will show a character. Shoot the corresponding shot to complete the mode. Additional shots to Xavier will eventually light the required shotCyclops: Shoot the right inner loop twice to start the mode. Shoot the same shot again, followed by the Storm ramp, to complete.Iceman: Shoot the right ramp twice to start the mode. Shoot the right ramp repeatedly to complete.Phoenix: Shoot the right loop twice to start the mode. During this mode, Phoenix, Cyclops, and Wolverine are lit. Shoot Phoenix twice, or Wolverine/Cyclops 4 times to complete.Completing a hero mode lights their name on the center of the playfield, starting a hero mode flashes them. Completing all Hero Modes opens Danger Room multiball.Villain modes are started by shooting the blackbird scoop. Two of these: Brotherhood and Hellfire Club, require 8 hits each to the standup targets at the side of the playfield. Completing all villain modes opens Dark Phoenix multiball.Progress towards Magneto multiball is started by locking at least one ball in the center lock. Additional locks are lit by shooting the two targets on either side of the lock, and then by shooting either the Rogue or Phoenix shots. Locking 4 balls starts a 4 ball multiball. Alternatively, a number of hits to a captured ball will start multiball, although with a reduced number of balls. Scoring in the multiball depends on which hero modes have been completed-the more modes that have been played, the higher the jackpot, and only played hero shots are lit for jackpots, so there is a significant incentive to play as many modes as possible before multiball. </div> "

In the game, a techno-organic race of aliens named the Phalanx invade (or according to the game manual, return) to Earth in order to take control of its inhabitants by assimilation. Most of the X-Men have been captured, except for Wolverine, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, The Beast, Psylocke, and Gambit, who have avoided capture and are trying to rescue both the other X-men and save the world. Along the way, the X-Men rescue their old arch-nemesis, Magneto, and, in a surprising turn of events, he joins them in their quest to defend the world from the Phalanx aggression. </div>  <div> Playable Characters : Initially, the player can play as any one of the six aforementioned X-Men. The game does not allow the player to select a character at the beginning, but rather thrusts the player in with a randomly selected character. Each character can jump, attack, and use their respective mutant power. Some characters, like Wolverine and Psylocke, can double-jump, while others, such as Cyclops, can charge up their power for an even more devastating version. Unlike the previous game, there is no set meter for the mutant power, allowing the player to instead use it as much as they like. If the player's character remains at full health, they become stronger than normal, and their mutant power reflects their additional level of strength. The six playable X-Men in the game are:Beast - Most of his attacks are all physical strength. When he has 9 or 10 bars of health, his special attack allows him to send shock waves to the to his surroundings as he slams the ground.Psylocke - Her special attack is using her arm to shock people.

Ys III: Wanderers from Ys,Riot,Nihon FalcomJPRenovation ProductsNA,December 1991[23],genesis,The third game in the Ys series developed by Nihon Falcom that introduced a new side-scrolling perspective and allowed the player to directly control Adol's ability to attack and jump for the first time. ,3030-4208,4208,0,1989-07-21,https://www.giantbomb.com/ys-iii-wanderers-from-ys/3030-4208/,CERO: A," <div> Overview : Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in Nihon Falcom's Ys franchise, a long-running series of action RPGs.Wanderers From Ys, like its predecessors, was originally published in Japan on the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801 computers on July 21, 1989. The title was soon released on other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000, and later saw ports created for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. While the original PC version was never localized into English, all of the console ports were eventually published in North America. Years later, Ys III was remade for Windows-based computers as Ys: The Oath in Felghana in 2005 which followed the same basic story while featuring the new gameplay systems and graphics engine introduced by Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. </div>  <div> Story : Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two hear rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure. </div>  <div> Gameplay : Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I & II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points (TGCD) or not (SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights. </div>  <div> Development : The original Ys was born from a prototype created by programmer Masaya Hashimoto that showed that full-screen 8-color scrolling was possible on the PC-88 . Similarly, Ys III began with Hashimoto's desire to achieve a side-scrolling parallax effect on the computer. Hashimoto experimented with this effect on Ys II but decided to take this technical challenge head on in his next game. The title was planned to be a side-scrolling action title directly inspired by The Adventure of Link and was initially completely unrelated to Ys. However, when development first began around the middle of 1988, the game used a sprite of Adol as a place-holder graphic for the main character. Because of this, the game eventually evolved into a spin-off to the Ys franchise tentatively called ""Adol's Great Adventure."" Hashimoto and map designer Seigo Oketani did not want ""Ys"" to be in the game's name since the continent of Ys was not featured in the story but the title was later changed to ""Wanderers from Ys.""Farewell message from Ys' staff that was removed in future re-releases.During the development of Wanderers, Hashimoto's relationship with Falcom's president had deteriorated greatly. In fact, before development had even started, Hashimoto and scenario writer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki intended to leave Falcom after Wanderers was finished. However, around February and March of 1989, almost the entire development team left the company. More than half of Wanderers had been completed by this point so the remaining staff at Falcom put the final touches on the game and it was released as ""Ys III: Wanderers from Ys"" on July 21, 1989. In initial advertisements and magazine articles, the game had only gone by the name ""Wanderers from Ys."" The team did not intend for the game to be a numbered installment but, once the team left, the title was changed to ""Ys III"" for marketing purposes.Masaya Hashimoto and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki would end up founding Quintet in April 1989 and many former Ys developers would help them create various action RPGs for the Super Nintendo. After all these departures, Falcom would team up with other developers to make the fourth entry in the Ys series before returning to making Ys games themselves with Ys V in 1995. Additionally, starting with Ys III, the company went through a short period where they stopped including staff credits in their games up until the release of titles like Brandish in 1991. </div>  <div> Reception : Ys III is often considered to be the black sheep of the Ys franchise by some fans due to its change in gameplay. Back in the day, Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, ""...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game"". </div>  <div> References : Ys I & II: The Development and Completion of Ys III, and One Speculation by Hiromasa Iwasaki (Colorful Pieces of Game, 2019). </div> "
